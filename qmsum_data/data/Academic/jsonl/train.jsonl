And , um , well , so , I mentioned the process that I 'm going through with the data , so , you know , I get the data back from the transcri Well , s uh , metaphorically , get the data back from the transcriber , and then I , check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that . And , um , I 'm going to be doing a more thorough editing , with respect to consistency of the conventions . But they 're {disfmarker} they 're generally very good . And , then , I run it through , uh , the channelize program to get it into the multi - channel format , OK . And {pause} the , what we discussed this morning , I would summarize as saying that , um , these units that result , in a {disfmarker} a particular channel and a particular timeband , at {disfmarker} at that level , um , vary in length . And , um , {nonvocalsound} their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long . But it 's really an empirical question , whether the units we get at this point through , just that process I described might be sufficient for them . So , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gonna do , is , I 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after I 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean . And I can do that , pretty quickly , with just , that minimal editing , without having to hand - break things ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc B", "content": "And then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , uh , with the {disfmarker} at that level , are sufficient .

And then , a similar conv uh , convention for numbers . So if they say one - eighty - three versus one eight three . Um , and also I 'll be , um , encoding , as I do my post - editing , the , things that are in curly brackets , which are clarificational material . And eh to incorporate , uh , keyword , at the beginning . So , it 's gonna be either a gloss or it 's gonna be a vocal sound like a , laugh or a cough , or , so forth .

And , uh , Liz and Andreas {disfmarker} actually they 're not here , but , they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment . And , again , I don't think we 'll be able to do with that alone , because , um , sometimes people correct themselves and things like that . But {disfmarker} so , I was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits , doing a forced alignment , and doing the timing ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Well , forced alignment would be one thing . What about just actually doing recognition ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Well , we {disfmarker} we know what they read , because we have the forms ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "No , they make mistakes ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Right .

I mean {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , uh , we 're talking about digits now . And {disfmarker} and so , um , there 's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been marked yet . Uh . And , um , {vocalsound} there 's the issue that {disfmarker} that they {disfmarker} we know what {disfmarker} what was said , but do we ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "I mean , so one option i"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Because people make mistakes and stuff .

So , if you do a forced alignment but the force but the {disfmarker} but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes , uh , or {vocalsound} false starts , it 's {disfmarker} it 's much less c {vocalsound} it 's {pause} much less common than one percent ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "But that 's pretty uncommon .

That was gonna be my question ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "I mean , we {disfmarker} so we have a {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} a system that works pretty well but it 's not , you know , the system that people here are used to using {disfmarker} to working with ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Well , I think what we wanna do is we want to {disfmarker} eh ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "So what {disfmarker} what do we do now ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "and we 've talked about this in other {pause} contexts {disfmarker} we want to {vocalsound} have the ability to feed it different features ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And then , um , {vocalsound} from the point of view of the front - end research , it would be s uh , substituting for HTK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "OK . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I think that 's the key thing . And then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "OK . Alright ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And then , um , uh , also Dave is {disfmarker} is thinking about using the data in different ways , uh , to {vocalsound} um , uh , explicitly work on reverberation"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "starting with some techniques that some other people have {pause} found somewhat useful , and {disfmarker} Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "OK . So {disfmarker} so the key {pause} thing that 's missing here is basically the ability to feed , you know , other features {vocalsound} i into the recognizer"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "and also then to train the system ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "OK . And , uh , es I don't know when Chuck will be back but that 's exactly what he {disfmarker} he 's gonna {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "H h He 's {disfmarker} he 's sort of back , but he drove for fourteen hours an and wasn't gonna make it in today ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Oh , OK . So , I think that 's one of the things that he said he would be working on . Um ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Just sort of t to make sure that {pause} we can do that"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "and {disfmarker} Um ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "It 's {disfmarker} uh , I mean , the {disfmarker} the front - end is f i tha that 's in the SRI recognizer is very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly but it unfortunately {pause} is not {pause} designed and , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like the , uh , ICSI system is , where you can feed it from a pipeline of {disfmarker} of the command . So , the {disfmarker} what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to , uh , dump out , um {disfmarker} you know , if you want to use some new features , you have to dump them into individual files and {pause} give those files to the recognizer ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "We do {disfmarker} we tend to do that anyway ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Oh . So , although you {disfmarker} you can pipe it as well , we tend to do it that way because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep re - doing it over and over ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Oh , OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Alright ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . So I 've {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "So tha that 's exactly what the P - file {pause} is for ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the cumbersome thing is {disfmarker} is , um {disfmarker} is that you actually have to dump out little {disfmarker} little files ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "So for each segment that you want to recognize {vocalsound} you have to {pause} dump out {pause} a separate file ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Just like i th like th as if there were these waveform segments , but instead you have sort of feature file segments . But , you know {disfmarker} So ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Cool . OK . So the s the {disfmarker} the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Oh . Yes , we have {disfmarker} I don't know , did you wanna talk about it , or {disfmarker} ? I can give a {disfmarker} I was just telling this to Jane and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} W we {disfmarker} we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors {pause} that were occurring and um , some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition , which is a um , I think was both a {disfmarker} a pruning {pause} problem and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations . And so we tried both of these st things . We tried saying {disfmarker} I don't know , I got this {vocalsound} whacky idea that {disfmarker} just from looking at the data , that when people talk {pause} their words are usually chunked together . It 's not that they say one word and then there 's a bunch of words together . They 're {comment} might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels ? But in general , if there 's , like , five or six words and one word 's far away from it , that 's probably wrong on average . So , um {disfmarker} And then also , ca the pruning , of course , was too {disfmarker} too severe ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "So that 's actually interesting . The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition . And we had lowered that {disfmarker} we had used tighter pruning after Liz ran some experiments showing that , you know , it runs slower and there 's no real difference in {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Actually it was better with {disfmarker} slightly better or about th"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "No gain ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "it was the same with tighter pruning ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Right . So for free recognition , this {disfmarker} the lower pruning value is better ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "It 's probably cuz the recognition 's just bad en at a point where it 's bad enough that {disfmarker} that you don't lose anything ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "You {disfmarker} Correct . Right . Um , but it turned out for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Um {pause} because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment , um , in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Um , {vocalsound} so that was one big factor that helped improve things and then the other thing was that , you know , as Liz said the {disfmarker} we f enforce the fact that , uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous . It cannot be {disfmarker} you cannot have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech . You can only have background speech at the beginning and the end ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah . I mean , yeah , it isn't always true , and I think what we really want is some clever way to do this , where , um , you know , from the data or from maybe some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that things like words that do occur just by themselves {pause} a alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "those would be able to do that ,"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Sorry ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "but the rest would be constrained . So , I think we have a version that 's pretty good for the native speakers . I don't know yet about the non - native speakers . And , um , we basically also made noise models for the different {disfmarker} sort of grouped some of the {pause} mouth noises together . Um , so , and then there 's a background speech model . And we also {disfmarker} There was some neat {disfmarker} or , interesting cases , like there 's one meeting where , {vocalsound} um , Jose 's giving a presentation and he 's talking about , um , the word \" mixed {pause} signal \" and someone didn't understand , uh , that you were saying \" mixed \" {disfmarker} I think , Morgan . And so your speech - ch was s saying something about mixed signal ."}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "And the next turn was a lot of people saying \" mixed \" , like \" he means mixed signal \" or \" I think it 's mixed \" . And the word \" mixed \" in this segment occurs , like , a bunch of times ."}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Sh"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "And Chuck 's on the lapel here , and he also says \" mixed \" but it 's at the last one , and of course the aligner th aligns it everywhere else to everybody else 's \" mixed \" ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "cuz there 's no adaptation yet . So there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think there 's some issues about {disfmarker} u We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker . But , I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker , and that 's actually a little bit of a f funky model . Like , it gives you some weird alignments , just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Oh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So there 's some things there ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "especially when you get lots of the same words , uh , occurring in the {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Well , the {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think you can do better by {vocalsound} uh , cloning {disfmarker} so we have a reject phone . And you {disfmarker} and what we wanted to try with {disfmarker} you know , once we have this paper written and have a little more time , {vocalsound} uh , t cloning that reject model and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground , like fragments and stuff , and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Right . I mean , in general we actually {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "And {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Right now the words like {pause} partial words are {pause} reject models and you normally allow those to match to any word ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "But then the background speech was also a reject model , and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between {disfmarker} you know , it needs to differentiate between the two . So just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "And another one is turns , like people starting with {vocalsound} \" well I think \" and someone else is {pause} \" well how about \" . So the word \" well \" is in this {disfmarker} in this {pause} segment multiple times , and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it . But then that constraint of sort of {disfmarker} uh , proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Is the proximity constraint a hard constraint , or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance , or {disfmarker} ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "We {disfmarker} we didn't {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Right now it 's a kluge ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "No .

We can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every decision node so {disfmarker} trying to im um {disfmarker} implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Right , right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "But I think that might be overdoing it a little ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "So {disfmarker} Yeah . So let me pop up a level . And uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same . So What we 're gonna do today is two related things . Uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . And decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules . so f the natural language understanding thing is uh , we think gonna only have to choose parameters , but You know , a fairly large set of parameters . So to do that , we need to do two things . One of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount . Then we need to figure out what influences its choices and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff . But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today . Technical stuff we 'll do {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} another day . Probably next week . But we are gonna worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . And we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with Fey on what there should be in the dialogues . So One of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh {disfmarker} in here , and have them actually record like this . Uh record dialogues more or less .

So the uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} on the left are decision nodes , and discreet values . So if {disfmarker} if we 're right , you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions , and it 's not all that many , and it 's perfectly feasible technically to build belief - nets that will do that .

Um , so , I 've be just been looking at , um , Ack ! What are you doing ? Yeah . OK . Um , I 've been looking at the PRM stuff . Um , so , this is , sort of like the latest thing I have on it , and I sorta constructed a couple of classes . Like , a user class , a site class , and {disfmarker} and you know , a time , a route , and then {disfmarker} and a query class . And I tried to simplify it down a little bit , so that I can actually um , look at it more . It 's the same paper that I gave to Jerry last time . Um , so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes , and then tried to {disfmarker} The red lines on the , um , graph are the um , relations between the different um , classes . Like , a user has like , a query , and then , also has , you know um , reference slots to its preferences , um , the special needs and , you know , money , and the user interest . And so this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that . And {disfmarker} So I tried to construct the dependency models , and a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net , and what they depend on , and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , so I tried to see how I can do , um {disfmarker} put in the computational nodes in between . And what that would look like in a PRM . And so I ended up making several classes {disfmarker} Actually , you know , a class of {disfmarker} with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes , and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility . And so some of these classes are {disfmarker} s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , or s f just from , I don't know , like the site . S like , um , these here , it 's only like , user , but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the um , preference of the user is versus , you know , what type of an event it is , or you know , which form of transportation the user has and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case . And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , um , then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites in {disfmarker} in mind . And so for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility . And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites , and that makes a {disfmarker} I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . And so , I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , cuz otherwise you would {disfmarker} c well , it 's probably the same . But um , No , you would definitely have {disfmarker} be able to re - use , like , {vocalsound} um , all the user stuff , and not {disfmarker} not having to recompute a lot of the stuff , because it 's all from the user side . So if you changed sites , you {disfmarker} you can , you know , save some work on that . But , you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how um , using the PRM will help . Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this {disfmarker} this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes . And that would {disfmarker} basically it 's just another class in the model , with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time . And then , after you group them together this {disfmarker} no the dependencies would {disfmarker} of the queries would be reduced to this . And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all . Um , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone on the PRM stuff ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Well"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "No . So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "The output ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So what decisions does this make ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "OK . So it only makes two decisions , in this model . And one is basically how desirable a site is meaning , um , how good it matches the needs of a user . And the other is the mode of the visit , whether th It 's the EVA decision . Um , so , instead of um , {vocalsound} doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of {disfmarker} the user wants to visit , I 'll come {disfmarker} well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites .

Anything else I missed ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So that was pretty quick .

Uh , so one of the things that Eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down . Uh , the people at Stanford write papers as if they had one , but , um , we 'll see . So w Anyway . So that 's a {disfmarker} a major open issue . If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually um , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it . Uh , and we 'll see . Uh , I actually think it is cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , um , will help in the expression .

I think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net , uh , without going to some incredible hacking of {disfmarker} sort of rebuilding it on the fly . I mean , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief - net . So that was one of the main reasons for doing it . Um . I don't know . So , uh , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert i it looked to me like if {comment} Eva were able to come up with a {vocalsound} you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing , that a travel planner should be able to take it from there .

So uh , uh , well , thanks for having me here , first of all . Um , so maybe just a {disfmarker} a little background on {disfmarker} on my visit . So , uh , I 'm not really involved in any project , that 's uh {disfmarker} that 's relevant to you uh , a at the moment , uh , the {disfmarker} the reason is really for me uh , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . And {disfmarker} and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , and um , I just hope that you have some comments or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , and {disfmarker} and so I 'll be uh , happy to talk to you and {disfmarker} and uh , I 'd also like to find out some more and {disfmarker} and maybe I 'll just walk around the office and and then {disfmarker} and ask some {disfmarker} some questions , uh , in a couple days . So I 'll be here for uh , tomorrow and then uh , the remainder of uh , next week . OK , so , um , what I started looking at , uh , to begin with is just uh , content management systems uh , i i in general . So um , uh what 's uh {disfmarker} Sort of the state of the art there is to um {disfmarker} uh you have a bunch of {disfmarker} of uh documents or learning units or learning objects , um , and you store meta - data uh , associate to them . So there 's some international standards like the I - triple - E , uh {disfmarker} There 's an I - triple - E , LON standard , and um , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have uh author information , you have uh , size information , format information and so on . Uh , but they 're two uh fields that are um , more interesting . One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh {disfmarker} with the document , and one is uh , you have sort of a , um , well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic uh , ordering of {disfmarker} of the {disfmarker} of the units . Now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses , uh you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh , whichever taxonomy is used , and uh , I think that 's a {disfmarker} that 's a very {disfmarker} that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that and uh {disfmarker} As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like , science , biology , and then {disfmarker} But that 's really all that we have at the moment . So I think there 's a huge , um , uh need for improvement there . Now , what this uh {disfmarker} a standard like this would give us is we could um , sort of uh with a search engine just query uh , different repositories all over the world . But we can't really {disfmarker} Um , so what I 'm {disfmarker} what I try to do is um , to have um , uh {disfmarker} So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . Now , what {disfmarker} what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh , students um , try to u program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same problems , uh , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not {disfmarker} it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and so , what I want to build is basically a {disfmarker} a smart F A Q system . Now , what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than \" I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . \" So . And I think that I don't need to tell you this . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sure you have the same {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , uh , context it , and {disfmarker} and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . So , I want to be able to model information like , um , so in the {disfmarker} in the context of {disfmarker} in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , um , what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's um , which um , which error message was encountered . So this sort of information I think should be transmitted , uh , when a certain document is retrieved . Now , um , basically giving this um {disfmarker} Uh so we somehow need to have a formalized um , way of writing this down basically , and that 's where the shared interpretation of {disfmarker} of certain terms and keywords comes in again . And , using this and some {disfmarker} some uh , knowledge about the domain I think you can do some {disfmarker} some simple inferences . Like you know that when somebody 's working about {disfmarker} uh , working on {disfmarker} on servlets for example , he 's using Java , cuz servlets are used {disfmarker} are written in Java . So some {disfmarker} some inferences like that , now , um , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of um {disfmarker} off the documents you 're {disfmarker} you 're searching against . So , uh what I wanna do is basically have some sort of um {disfmarker} given these inputs , and then I can compute how many documents match , and use this as a metric in the search . Now , what I plan to do is I want to uh sort of do a uh {disfmarker} uh {pause} try to improve the quality of the search results , and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um {disfmarker} steepest descent approach . So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? And {disfmarker} and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , and find out which um {disfmarker} which questions are worth um , asking . And that 's what I then propagate back to the user , and {disfmarker} and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . Now , the big problem that I 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that {disfmarker} that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . And uh uh , so Robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network , which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . And so , uh what I 'm {disfmarker} What I try to do is basically try to model this uh , in a way that you could really combine uh , knowledge from very different sources , and {disfmarker} and um , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh , came up with . Trying to {disfmarker} to have uh , an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh {disfmarker} representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , um , what you can do with those . Um . What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh , computational model . That {disfmarker} that probably isn't expressive enough . So . So that 's another thing , um , which I think you 're also uh , uh looking into right now . And then um , uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea , um , uh that would be now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository {disfmarker} depending on which {disfmarker} um , uh , which uh , rules and which ontologies it {disfmarker} it uses , or basically its view of the world , uh you can get very different results . So it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines . And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a {disfmarker} a peer to peer approach , where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , and um , if you have a question about a homework , it 's {disfmarker} probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , rather than going to some Yahoo - like uh , search engine . So these are some of the {disfmarker} just in a nutshell , some of the ideas . And I think a lot of the {disfmarker} even though it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , um , issues are {disfmarker} are fairly similar . So . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "And so some of the {disfmarker} I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project , I {disfmarker} Are you {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Uh I know , yeah I know abou about it ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So it seems like a lot of {disfmarker} some of the issues are the same .

So \" this document explains how to set up your uh , mail account on Linux \" or something like this ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So . So something {disfmarker} something very specific that you can then {disfmarker} But the {disfmarker} I think that the key point with these uh , learning systems is that uh , a learning system is only as good as uh the amount of content it {disfmarker} it carries ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mmm , mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "You can have the best learning system with the best search interface , if there 's no content inside of it , it 's not very useful .

Right , exactly , OK , that 's the link ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "This uh {disfmarker} Oh , they refused the budget again ? Is it {disfmarker} so about CITRIS ? Yeah , still nothing ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Uh , this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} t the s we 're , uh , involved in a literally three hundred million dollar uh , program . Uh , with the State of California . And , the State of California is now a month and a half behind its legis its legally required date to approve a budget . So the budget has not been approved . And two days ago {disfmarker} There 's two l you know , so , two branches of legislature . One branch approved it ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "and , um , yesterdayday {comment} there was this uh {disfmarker} uh I thought that the other branch would just approve it , but now there 's actually a little back sliding to people who {disfmarker} who approved it got flak from there , eh anyway . So , um {disfmarker} Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this , OK ? And then we 'll go . So , I {disfmarker} it turns out I wound up having lunch today with a guy named Tom Kalil . KILL {disfmarker} KALIL . And , uh , he now works at Berkeley . In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS , even though we don't have the money they {disfmarker} So they 've been hiring people right and left , so , uh , they think the money 's coming . So {disfmarker} and he was , I think , the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters . He was in the White House , I don't remember what he was saying . A anyway , like that . And , is now doing all the politics for CITRIS , but also , has a uh , a lot of interest in uh , actually doing things for society , so digital divide and stuff like that . So that 's s interesting to me but maybe not to you . But the really interesting thing was , he st he s he s said something about , you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , something that is of great social value . He said , \" for example \" , this was his only example , \" if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor , and as compelling as a video game , then that would have a huge social impact \" . I said , \" Oh great ! That 's a good problem to work on . \" Anyway . So it was nice that uh , he 's got this view , of A , that 's what you should try to do , and B , uh , language would be a good way to do it ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mmm . Definitely ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So that 's {disfmarker} So anyway , that 's the end of the story ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "But for adults and not for the children ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "This was {disfmarker} Yeah . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "but , uh , you know , a again , if {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} if you"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "um , and this was {disfmarker} this was literacy , which actually is somewhat different problem ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Maybe easier . I don't know . So this is reading , rather than teaching {disfmarker} Another project we started on , and {disfmarker} and didn't get funded for was , uh , to try to build an automatic tutoring program , for kids whose first language wasn't English . Which is like half the school population in California . Something like that ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "isn't it ? Yeah . So , enormous problem in California , and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build {vocalsound} uh , programs that would be tutors for the kids . We think we could . Anyway . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} But this is a slightly different problem ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "and um , I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now , but it i it 's {disfmarker} it 's interesting and I may um , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that .

So I {disfmarker} I did manage to get {disfmarker} pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "No , no ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "but uh or {disfmarker} a temporarily putting it out of the sling"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "but , I {disfmarker} I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "and also revising , thanks for all the comments , the c the original construal proposal .

Right . Anyway . Yeah , so {disfmarker} OK , so that 'd be great , but I 'd {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's time again , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Absolutely .

Uh I guess it makes a l um at this point this is I {disfmarker} I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit uh And you {disfmarker} you yellowed these out uh but uh uh Oh I see yeah that {disfmarker} that one you can't use because of the delay .

OK . And what {disfmarker} and what 's OGI forty - five ?

So um , how 's it going on the {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Um ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So . You {disfmarker} you did some things . They didn't improve things in a way that convinced you you 'd substantially improved anything ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "But they 're not making things worse and we have reduced latency , right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah . But actually {disfmarker} um actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well - matched case and we just noticed that {disfmarker} Yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny . It 's not a mean of word error rate . It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate , it 's a weighted mean of improvements ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "So . Which means that {vocalsound} actually the weight on the well - matched is {disfmarker} Well I well what what {disfmarker} What happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case {vocalsound} it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference because the reference system is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is quite good for {disfmarker} for the well - ma well - matched case also ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "So it {disfmarker} it weights the improvement on the well - matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "No , but it 's the weighting of the {disfmarker} of the improvement not of the error rate ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , and it 's hard to improve on the {disfmarker} on the best case , cuz it 's already so good , right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah but {pause} what I mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the H {disfmarker} HMK 's , uh like five percent uh absolute , and this will not affect the final score almost {disfmarker} Uh this will almost not affect the final score because {vocalsound} this improvement {disfmarker} because the improvement {vocalsound} uh relative to the {disfmarker} the baseline is small {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy ? rather than word error rate ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Uh . Uh improvement ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "No , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "yeah . Sorry ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh {vocalsound} improvement then that 's fifty percent ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK . So what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate , {vocalsound} then uh a {disfmarker} even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms , {vocalsound} will show up as quite {disfmarker} quite large in this ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Is that what you 're saying ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK . But yeah that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} it 's the notion of relative improvement . Word error rate ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah . Sure , but when we think about the weighting , which is point five , point three , point two , {vocalsound} it 's on absolute on {disfmarker} on relative figures ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "not {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "So when we look at this error rate"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "No . That 's why I 've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh and {disfmarker} and not {disfmarker} not at {vocalsound} at accuracies ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "uh {disfmarker} Mmm , yeah . Mmm , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "It 's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "I mean uh we probably should have standardized on that all the way through . It 's just {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Well ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I mean , it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not that different , right ? I mean , just subtract the accuracy ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah but you 're {disfmarker} but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I mean {disfmarker} Oh . Oh , I see . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "If you had ninety percent uh correct {vocalsound} and five percent , five over ninety doesn't look like it 's a big difference , but {vocalsound} five over ten is {disfmarker} is big ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and {vocalsound} getting sense of what was important ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I see .

So it 's around , like , point five . No , point six {comment} uh percent absolute on Italian {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Worse ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Worse , yep ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Out of what ?

Uh , do you know what pie"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah . I guess {disfmarker} I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's the filter .

There is first this thing , and then the {disfmarker} yeah , I computed the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like , the confidence level on the different test sets .

Do the {disfmarker} does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah . But . Uh . About the same . It doesn't hurt . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Doesn't hurt , but doesn't get a little better , or something ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "No . OK , so {vocalsound} um I guess the argument one might make is that , \" Yeah , if you looked at one of these cases {vocalsound} and you jiggle something and it changes {vocalsound} then uh you 're not quite sure what to make of it . But when you look across a bunch of these and there 's some {disfmarker} some pattern , um {disfmarker} I mean , so eh h here 's all the {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if in all these different cases {vocalsound} it never gets better , and there 's significant number of cases where it gets worse , {vocalsound} then you 're probably {pause} hurting things , {vocalsound} I would say . So um {vocalsound} I mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with {disfmarker} with a different test set , that you 're not jiggling things with .

If you can {disfmarker} if we can approximate {vocalsound} the old numbers while still keeping the latency down ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mmm . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Uh , so . Um .

So say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time , but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ? And , um {disfmarker} So I w bef before , um {disfmarker} Back in May , I did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , um , here , I was curious , what if I trained the models using twelve seconds but I f I gave it a situation where the test set I was {disfmarker} subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , um {disfmarker} So I did that for about three different conditions . And , um {disfmarker} I mean , I th I think it was , um , four se I think {disfmarker} I think it was , um , something like four seconds and , um , six seconds , and eight seconds . Something like that . And it seems like it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it hurts compared to if you actually train the models {comment} using th that same length of time but it {disfmarker} it doesn't hurt that much . Um , u usually less than point five percent , although I think I did see one where it was a point eight percent or so rise in word error rate . But this is , um , w where , um , even if I train on the , uh , model , and mean subtracted it with the same length of time as in the test , it {disfmarker} the word error rate is around , um , ten percent or nine percent .

And so , the other thing is just to design a filter . You know , basically you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're doing a high - pass filter or a band - pass filter of some sort and {disfmarker} and just design a filter .

So {disfmarker} so yeah , you have an {disfmarker} an estimation of the noise spectrum , but sometimes , of course , it 's {disfmarker} as the noise is not perfectly stationary , sometimes this estimation can be , uh , too small , so you don't subtract enough .

The second thing I was working on is to , um , try to look at noise estimation , {comment} mmm , and using some technique that doesn't need voice activity detection . Um , and for this I u simply used some code that , uh , {vocalsound} I had from {disfmarker} from Belgium , which is technique that , um , takes a bunch of frame , um , and for each frequency bands of this frame , takes a look at the minima of the energy . And then average these minima and take this as an {disfmarker} an energy estimate of the noise for this particular frequency band . And there is something more to this actually . What is done is that , {vocalsound} uh , these minima are computed , um , based on , um , high resolution spectra . So , I compute an FFT based on the long , uh , signal frame which is sixty - four millisecond {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So you have one minimum for each frequency ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "What {disfmarker} what I {disfmarker} what I d uh , I do actually , is to take a bunch of {disfmarker} to take a tile on the spectrogram and this tile is five hundred milliseconds long and two hundred hertz wide ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "And this tile {disfmarker} Uh , in this tile appears , like , the harmonics if you have a voiced sound , because it 's {disfmarker} it 's the FTT bins .

And {disfmarker} If you have other {disfmarker} other kind of speech sounds then it 's not the case , but if the time frame is long enough , uh , like s five hundred milliseconds seems to be long enough , {comment} you still have portions which , uh , are very close {disfmarker} whi which minima are very close to the noise energy ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "I 'm confused .

So the interest of this is that , as y with this technique you can estimate u some reasonable noise spectra with only five hundred milliseconds of {disfmarker} of signal , so if the {disfmarker} the n the noise varies a lot , uh , you can track {disfmarker} better track the noise ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "which is not the case if you rely on the voice activity detector .

So what I did is just to simply replace the VAD - based , uh , noise estimate by this estimate , first on SpeechDat - Car {disfmarker} Well , only on SpeechDat - Car actually . And it 's , uh , slightly worse , like one percent relative compared to the VAD - based {pause} estimates .

Um . Yeah . I , um , also implemented a sp um {disfmarker} spectral whitening idea which is in the , um , Ericsson proposal . Uh , the idea is just to {vocalsound} um , flatten the log , uh , spectrum , um , and to flatten it more if the {disfmarker} the probability of silence is higher . So in this way , you can also reduce {disfmarker} somewhat reduce the musical noise and you reduce the variability if you have different noise shapes , because the {disfmarker} the spectrum becomes more flat in the silence portions . Um . Yeah . With this , no improvement , uh , but there are a lot of parameters that we can play with and , um {disfmarker} Actually , this {disfmarker} this could be seen as a soft version of the frame dropping because , um , you could just put the threshold and say that \" below the threshold , I will flatten {disfmarker} comp completely flatten the {disfmarker} the spectrum \" . And above this threshold , uh , keep the same spectrum . So it would be like frame dropping , because during the silence portions which are below the threshold of voice activity probability , {comment} uh , w you would have some kind of dummy frame which is a perfectly flat spectrum . And this , uh , whitening is something that 's more soft because , um , you whiten {disfmarker} you just , uh , have a function {disfmarker} the whitening is a function of the speech probability , so it 's not a hard decision ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Um , so I think maybe it can be used together with frame dropping and when we are not sure about if it 's speech or silence , well , maybe it has something do with this ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "It 's interesting .

And at that point I discovered certain things like , um , \" accommodate \" with one \" M \" , that kind of thing .

Exactly ! Exactly !

And th and then another check involves , uh , being sure that every utterance has an identifiable speaker . And if not , then that gets checked . Then there 's this issue of glossing s w so - called \" spoken - forms \" . So there {disfmarker} mo for the most part , we 're keeping it standard wo word level transcription . But there 's {disfmarker} w And that that 's done with the assumption that {pause} pronunciation variants can be handled . So for things like \" and \" , the fact that someone doesn't say the \" D \" , uh that 's not important enough to capture in the transcription because a {disfmarker} a good pronunciation , uh , you know , model would be able to handle that .

So \" wanna \" is another one , \" going {disfmarker} \" uh , \" gonna \" is another one , with just the assumption , again , that this {disfmarker} th these are things which it 's not really fair to a c consider {disfmarker} expect that {disfmarker} a pronunciation model , to handle .

For example , they could be \" time of day \" , in which case we could , uh , say , you know , \" Morning , afternoon , evening , night \" . So , this could be more So , it 's a lot , anyway . And , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain . So {pause} Noisy - ORs are a way to , uh , {vocalsound} sort of deal with this . Um Where should I put this ? So , the idea is that , um , {vocalsound} Let 's call these , uh , C - one , C - two , C - three , and C - four , and E , for Cause and Effect , I guess . The idea is to have these intermediate nodes . Right . Well , actually , the idea , first of all , is that each of these things has a {disfmarker} quote - unquote distinguished state , which means that this is {vocalsound} the state in which we don't really know anything about it . So {disfmarker} right ? So , for example , if we don't really know {vocalsound} if the thing is a landmark or not , Or , i if that just doesn't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the Disting - the Distinguish state . It 's a really , you know , {vocalsound} if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee , you know , if they didn't talk about it , that would be the Distinguish state ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "S so , this is a fanciful way of saying \" default \" ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "That 's just what they {disfmarker} the word they used in that paper ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So , the idea is that , um , {vocalsound} you have these intermediate nodes , right ? E - one , E - two , E - three and E - four ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , this is the Heckerman paper you 're working with ? Good ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . So {pause} The idea is that , each of these EI {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} represents what this would be {disfmarker} if all the other ones were in the distinguish state . Right ? So , for example , suppose that the person {disfmarker} I mean , suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark . But none of the other {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sort of cues really apply . Then , {vocalsound} this would be {disfmarker} W The {vocalsound} this would just represent the probability distribution of this , assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply ? So , you know , if it is a landmark , and no none of the other things really ap applicable , then {disfmarker} this would represent the probability distribution . So maybe in this case {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Maybe we just t k Maybe we decide that , if the thing 's a landmark and we don't know anything else , then we 're gonna conclude that , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} They want to view it with probability , you know , point four . They want to enter it with probability , uh {disfmarker} with probability point five and they want to approach it probability point one , say {disfmarker} Right ? So we come up with these l little tables for each of those OK . And the final thing is that , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is a deterministic function of these , so we don't need to specify any probabilities . We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ? So we can let this be , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four . Right ? and our example G would be , um , {vocalsound} a majority vote ? Right ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Well . OK , so th so the important point {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} W not what the G function is . The important point is {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} There is a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a general kind of idea of shortcutting the full CPT . Th - c the full conditional probability table {disfmarker} with some function . OK ? Which y w you choose appropriately for each case . So , depending on {vocalsound} what your situation is , there are different functions which are most appropriate .

But for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . And if you don't include that in the model , it doesn't work very well . So in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at .

And that 's I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker} and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and {disfmarker} and additive effects . And that 's hard enough . I mean , I don't think we really {disfmarker} I mean , we 're trying to deal with that . In a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this Aurora task . And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . And we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise . Uh , even that 's hard enough . And {disfmarker} and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category . i i There 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on {disfmarker} on juggling everything around . But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . And , um , so Dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with {disfmarker} with long time effects but when it 's {disfmarker} when there 's noise there too , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's pretty hard . So we have to start {disfmarker} Since any {disfmarker} almost any real situation is gonna have {disfmarker} uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things , we {disfmarker} we actually have to think about both at the same time ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , um {disfmarker} So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what {disfmarker} what else is in the {disfmarker} the form we have ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah , well , {vocalsound} the , um , the other parts of the system are the {disfmarker} the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So that 's {disfmarker} again , that {disfmarker} that 's the Wiener filtering , followed by , uh {disfmarker} uh , that 's done at the FFT level .

So the things that we , um , uh , I guess we sort of {disfmarker} uh , There 's {disfmarker} there 's some , uh , neat ideas for {vocalsound} V A So , I mean , in {disfmarker} I think there 's sort of like {disfmarker} There 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff . There 's questions about {pause} various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or {pause} ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise . And there 's gonna be a host of those . But structurally it seemed like the things {disfmarker} the main things that {disfmarker} that we brought up that , uh , are {disfmarker} are gonna need to get worked on seriously are , uh , uh , a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a significantly better VAD , uh , putting the neural net on , um , which , you know , we haven't been doing anything with , the , uh , neural net at the end there , and , uh , the , uh , {vocalsound} opening up the second front .

A third thing is that , um , {vocalsound} I play a little bit with the , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} finding what was different between , um , And there were a couple of differences , like the LDA filters were not the same . Um , he had the France Telecom blind equalization in the system . Um , the number o of MFCC that was {disfmarker} were used was different . You used thirteen and we used fifteen . Well , a bunch of differences . And , um , actually the result that he {disfmarker} he got were much better on TI - digits especially . So I 'm kind of investigated to see what was the main factor for this difference . And it seems that the LDA filter is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} was hurting . Um , {vocalsound} so when we put s some noise compensation the , um , LDA filter that {disfmarker} that 's derived from noisy speech is not more {disfmarker} anymore optimal . And it makes a big difference , um , {vocalsound} on TI - digits trained on clean . Uh , if we use the {disfmarker} the old LDA filter , I mean the LDA filter that was in the proposal , we have , like , eighty - two point seven percent recognition rate , um , on noisy speech when the system is trained on clean speech .

Yeah .

And so I thought at first , um , that , uh , what I should do is unwrap the phase because that will undo that .

I mean , maybe there 's some deeper reason why it isn't the right thing to do . But , um , at least in principle it looks like there 's {disfmarker} there 's , uh , a couple potential ways to do it . One {disfmarker} one being to just work with the complex numbers , um , and , uh {disfmarker} in rectangular kind of coordinates . And the other is {vocalsound} to , uh , do a Taylor series {disfmarker} Well . So you work with the complex numbers and then when you get the spectrum {disfmarker} the average complex spectrum {disfmarker} um , actually divide it out , um , as opposed to taking the log and subtracting . So then , um , um , you know , there might be some numerical issues . We don't really know that . The other thing we talked a little bit about was Taylor series expansion . And , um , uh , actually I was talking to Dick Karp about it a little bit , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , since I got thinking about it , and {disfmarker} and , uh , so one thing is that y you 'd have to do , I think , uh {disfmarker} we may have to do this on a whiteboard , but I think you have to be a little careful about scaling the numbers that you 're {vocalsound} taking {disfmarker} the complex numbers that you 're taking the log of because {vocalsound} the Taylor expansion for it has , you know , a square and a cube , and {disfmarker} and so forth . And {disfmarker} and so if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you have a {disfmarker} a number that is modulus , you know , uh , very different from one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It should be right around one , if it 's {disfmarker} cuz it 's a expansion of log one {disfmarker} one minus epsilon or o is {disfmarker} is {vocalsound} one plus epsilon , or is it one plus {disfmarker} ? Well , there 's an epsilon squared over two and an epsilon cubed over three ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "and so forth . So if epsilon is bigger than one , then it diverges ."}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So you have to do some scaling .

You know , you have some sort of a , uh , general speech model , you know , maybe just a mixture of Gaussians that you evaluate every utterance against , and then you see where each , you know , utterance {disfmarker} like , the likelihood of each utterance .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "But as far as , I mean {disfmarker} Like I thought BBN did a thing with , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization a ways back .

It may be entirely off and {disfmarker} and it may be {disfmarker} at the very least it may be quite different for MSG than it is for mel cepstrum or PLP . So that would be {disfmarker} So the first thing I 'd look at without adjusting anything would just be to go back to the experiment and look at the , uh , substitutions , insertions , and deletions . And if the {disfmarker} if the , uh {disfmarker} i if there 's a fairly large effect of the difference , say , uh , uh , the r ratio between insertions and deletions for the two cases then that would be , uh , an indicator that it might {disfmarker} might be in that direction ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm .

OK . Ah , interesting . Yeah . Yeah . Oh , sure . Yeah , sure .

Ah ! Clever . Yes . Clever . Yeah . Excellent ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning Thilo came in and said that {vocalsound} um , there could be {pause} other differences between {vocalsound} the uh {pause} already transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that has {pause} just r been run through his process ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "And that 's the purpose .

Well ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "but {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "that 's {disfmarker} that 's right , but you know , thi this brings me to the other f stage of this which I discussed with you earlier today ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "which is {vocalsound} the second stage is {vocalsound} um , w what to do {pause} in terms of the transcribers adjustment of these data . I discussed this with you too . Um , the tr so the idea initially was , we would get {vocalsound} uh , for the new meetings , so the e EDU meetings , that {vocalsound} Thilo ha has now presegmented all of them for us , on a channel by channel basis . And um , so , I 've assigned {disfmarker} I 've {disfmarker} I 've assigned them to our transcribers and um , so far I 've discussed it with one , with uh {disfmarker} And I had a {pause} about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday , we went through {vocalsound} uh EDU - one , at some extent . And it occurred to me that {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} that {vocalsound} basically what we have in this kind of a format is {disfmarker} you could consider it as a staggered mixed file , we had some discussion over the weekend a about {disfmarker} at {disfmarker} at this other meeting that we were all a at {disfmarker} um , {vocalsound} about whether the tran the IBM transcribers should hear a single channel audio , or a mixed channel audio . And um , {vocalsound} in {disfmarker} in a way , by {disfmarker} by having this {disfmarker} this chunk and then the backchannel {vocalsound} after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel . And um , {vocalsound} it occurred {pause} to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um , um , the {disfmarker} {pause} the {disfmarker} the maximal gain , it 's {disfmarker} from the IBM {pause} people , may be in long stretches of connected speech . So it 's basically a whole bunch of words {vocalsound} which they can really do , because of the continuity within that person 's turn . So , what I 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this , {comment} but {disfmarker} but what I 'm thinking is that {vocalsound} in the EDU meetings , they tend to be {vocalsound} driven by a couple of dominant speakers . And , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , {vocalsound} then , when {disfmarker} when it got s patched together when it comes back from IBM , we can add the backchannels . It seems to me {vocalsound} that {vocalsound} um , you know , the backchannels per - se wouldn't be so hard , but then there 's this question of the time {pause} @ @ {comment} uh , marking , and whether the beeps would be {vocalsound} uh y y y And I 'm not exactly sure how that {disfmarker} how that would work with the {disfmarker} with the backchannels . And , so um {disfmarker} And certainly things that are {vocalsound} intrusions of multiple words , {vocalsound} taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred , {vocalsound} that would be hard . So , m my {vocalsound} thought is {pause} i I 'm having this transcriber go through {vocalsound} the EDU - one meeting , and indicate a start time {nonvocalsound} f for each dominant speaker , endpoi end time for each dominant speaker , and the idea that {vocalsound} these units would be generated for the dominant speakers , {vocalsound} and maybe not for the other channels ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Yeah the only , um , disadvantage of that is , then it 's hard to use an automatic method to do that .

I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I think um , you know , the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust the t the boundaries , and all that for all the channels but , {vocalsound} you know , that is so time - consuming , and since we have a bottleneck here , we want to get IBM things that are usable s as soon as possible , then this seemed to me it 'd be a way of gett to get them a flood of data , which would be useful when it comes back to us .

And in the other {disfmarker} in the other case , if it 's marked as speech , {vocalsound} and really there 's nothing transcribable in it , then she 's going to put a s dash , and I 'll go through and it {disfmarker} and um , you know , with a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} with a substitution command , get it so that it 's clear that those are the other category . I 'll just , you know , recode them . But um , {vocalsound} um , the transcribable events {pause} that um , I 'm considering in this , {vocalsound} uh , continue to be {vocalsound} laugh , as well as speech , and cough and things like that , so I 'm not stripping out anything , just {disfmarker} just you know , being very lenient in what 's considered speech .

So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff , so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you 've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate {pause} uh , belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate .

So um you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion is that we start digging into them both , uh , in a way we that , you know , th hopefully turns out to be consistent , so that the {disfmarker} Um .

The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours , that they have admission fees , they have whatever . And then , this is {disfmarker} We go via a thesaurus and look up {pause} certain linguistic surface structures {pause} that are related to these concepts and feed those through the dialogue history and check dynamically for each e entity . We look it up check whether any of these were mentioned and then activate the corresponding nodes on the discourse side .

Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "And .

Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Um . So . I mean , the HTK is an older HTK , even . So . Yeah it {disfmarker} it 's not that surprising ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "But to me it just {disfmarker} it just meant a practical {vocalsound} point that um if we want to {vocalsound} publish results on digits that {disfmarker} that people pay {vocalsound} attention to we probably should uh {disfmarker} Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get {disfmarker} show some {vocalsound} nice improvement on something that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh , uh {disfmarker} it seems like too large a number , and uh {vocalsound} uh people don't necessarily take it so seriously ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Um .

Yeah , but they had to {pause} get rid of it because of the space , didn't they ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah . So . Yeah . But the abso assumption is that we will be able to make a VAD that 's small and that works fine . And . So we can {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Well . So that 's a problem . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah but {disfmarker} nnn ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "But the other thing is uh to use a different VAD entirely . I mean , uh i if {disfmarker} if there 's a {vocalsound} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't know what the thinking was amongst the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} the ETSI folk but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .

You miss most of the reverberation tail in a ten millisecond window and so {vocalsound} {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you 'd like it to be that {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} the reverberation responses um simply convolved um in , but it 's not really with these ten millisecond frames cuz you j But if you take , say , a two millisecond {vocalsound} um window {disfmarker} I 'm sorry a two second window then in a room like this , most of the reverberation response {vocalsound} is included in the window and the {disfmarker} then it um {vocalsound} then things are l more linear . It is {disfmarker} it is more like the reverberation response is simply c convolved and um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and you can use channel normalization techniques {vocalsound} like uh in his thesis he 's assuming that the reverberation response is fixed . He just does um {vocalsound} mean subtraction , which is like removing the DC component of the modulation spectrum and {vocalsound} that 's supposed to d um deal {disfmarker} uh deal pretty well with the um reverberation and um {vocalsound} the neat thing is you can't take these two second frames and feed them to a speech recognizer um {vocalsound} so he does this {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} method training trading the um {vocalsound} the spectral resolution for time resolution {vocalsound} and um {vocalsound} come ca uh synthesizes a new representation which is with say ten second frames but a lower s um {vocalsound} frequency resolution . So I don't really know the theory .

And {disfmarker} and then Barry can say something about {pause} what {comment} {disfmarker} what we 're talking about ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK . So Michael Kleinschmidt , who 's a PHD student from Germany , {vocalsound} showed up this week . He 'll be here for about six months . And he 's done some work using {vocalsound} an auditory model {pause} of , um , {vocalsound} human hearing , and {pause} using that f uh , to generate speech recognition features . And {pause} he did {vocalsound} work back in Germany {vocalsound} with , um , a toy recognition system {vocalsound} using , um , isolated {vocalsound} digit recognition {vocalsound} as the task . It was actually just a single - layer neural network {vocalsound} that classified words {disfmarker} classified digits , {vocalsound} in fact . Um , and {pause} he tried that on {disfmarker} I think on some Aurora data and got results that he thought {pause} seemed respectable . And he w he 's coming here to u u use it on a {vocalsound} uh , a real speech recognition system . So I 'll be working with him on that . And , um , maybe I should say a little more about these features , although I don't understand them that well . The {disfmarker} I think it 's a two - stage idea . And , um , {vocalsound} the first stage of these features correspond to what 's called the peripheral {vocalsound} auditory system . And {vocalsound} I guess that is like {vocalsound} a filter bank with a compressive nonlinearity . And {vocalsound} I 'm - I 'm not sure what we have @ @ in there that isn't already modeled in something like , {vocalsound} um , {pause} PLP . I should learn more about that . And then {vocalsound} the second stage {pause} is , um , {vocalsound} the most different thing , I think , from what we usually do . It 's , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} it computes features which are , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} based on {disfmarker} sort of like based on diffe different w um , wavelet basis functions {vocalsound} used to analyze {vocalsound} the input .  So th he uses analysis functions called {vocalsound} Gabor functions , um , {vocalsound} which have a certain {vocalsound} extent , um , {vocalsound} in time and in frequency . And {vocalsound} the idea is these are used to sample , {vocalsound} um , the signal in a represented as a time - frequency representation . So you 're {pause} sampling some piece of this time - frequency plane . And , um , {vocalsound} that , {vocalsound} um , is {disfmarker} is interesting , cuz , {vocalsound} @ @ for {disfmarker} for one thing , you could use it , {vocalsound} um , in a {disfmarker} a multi - scale way . You could have these {disfmarker} instead of having everything {disfmarker} like we use a twenty - five millisecond or so analysis window , {vocalsound} typically , um , and that 's our time scale for features , but you could {disfmarker} {vocalsound} using this , um , basis function idea , you could have some basis functions which have a lot longer time scale and , um , some which have a lot shorter , and {vocalsound} so it would be like {pause} a set of multi - scale features . So he 's interested in , um {disfmarker} Th - this is {disfmarker} because it 's , um {disfmarker} there are these different parameters for the shape of these {vocalsound} basis functions , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there are a lot of different possible basis functions . And so he {disfmarker} {vocalsound} he actually does {vocalsound} an optimization procedure to choose an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an optimal set of basis functions out of all the possible ones ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Hmm . H What does he do to choose those ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "The method he uses is kind of funny {disfmarker} is , {comment} {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} he starts with {disfmarker} he has a set of M of them . Um , he {disfmarker} and then {pause} he uses that to classify {disfmarker} I mean , he t he tries , um , {vocalsound} using {pause} just M minus one of them . So there are M possible subsets of this {vocalsound} length - M vector . He tries classifying , using each of the M {vocalsound} possible sub - vectors ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Whichever sub - vector , {vocalsound} um , works the {disfmarker} the best , I guess , he says {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the fe feature that didn't use was the most useless feature ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Y yeah . Gets thrown out . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "so we 'll throw it out and we 're gonna randomly select another feature {pause} from the set of possible basis functions ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Hmm !"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So it 's a {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So i so it 's actuall"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "it 's a little bit like a genetic algorithm or something in a way ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's much simpler ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "It 's like a greedy {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "But it 's {disfmarker} but it 's {disfmarker} uh , it 's {disfmarker} there 's a lot {disfmarker} number of things I like about it , let me just say ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Greedy ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , first thing , well , you 're absolutely right . I mean , {vocalsound} i i {nonvocalsound} in truth , {pause} both pieces of this are {disfmarker} have their analogies in stuff we already do . But it 's a different take {vocalsound} at how to approach it and potentially one that 's m maybe a bit more systematic than what we 've done , uh , and a b a bit more inspiration from {disfmarker} from auditory things . So it 's {disfmarker} so I think it 's a neat thing to try . The primary features , {vocalsound} um , are in fact {disfmarker} Yeah , essentially , it 's {disfmarker} it 's , uh , you know , PLP or {disfmarker} or mel cepstrum , or something like that . You 've {disfmarker} you 've got some , {vocalsound} uh , compression . We always have some compression . We always have some {disfmarker} you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the kind of filter bank with a kind of {vocalsound} {vocalsound} quasi - log scaling . Um , {vocalsound} if you put in {disfmarker} if you also include the RASTA in it {disfmarker} i RASTA {disfmarker} the filtering being done in the log domain {vocalsound} has an AGC - like , uh , characteristic , which , you know , people typi typically put in these kind of , {vocalsound} uh , {pause} um , {vocalsound} uh , auditory front - ends . So it 's very , very similar , uh , but it 's not exactly the same . Um , I would agree that the second one is {disfmarker} is somewhat more different but , {vocalsound} um , it 's mainly different in that the things that we have been doing like that have been {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um , had a different kind of motivation and have ended up with different kinds of constraints . So , for instance , if you look at the LDA RASTA stuff , {vocalsound} you know , basically what they do is they {disfmarker} they look at the different eigenvectors out of the LDA and they form filters out of it . Right ? And those {pause} filters have different , uh , kinds of temporal extents and temporal characteristics . And so in fact they 're multi - scale . But , they 're not sort of systematically multi - scale , like \" let 's start here and go to there , and go to there , and go to there \" , and so forth . It 's more like , {vocalsound} you run it on this , you do discriminant analysis , and you find out what 's helpful . "}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "I it 's multi - scale because you use several of these in parallel ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . They use several of them ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "is that right ? Of {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh , I mean , you don't have to but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , uh , Hynek has . Um , but it 's also , uh {disfmarker}  Hyn - when Hynek 's had people do this kind of LDA analysis , they 've done it on frequency direction and they 've done it on the time direction . I think he may have had people sometimes doing it on both simultaneously {disfmarker} some two - D {disfmarker} and that would be the closest to these Gabor function kind of things . Uh , but I don't think they 've done that much of that . And , uh , the other thing that 's interesting {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the , uh {disfmarker} the feature selection thing , it 's a simple method , but I kinda like it . Um , {vocalsound} there 's a {disfmarker} {pause} a old , old method for feature selection . I mean , {pause} eh , uh , I remember people referring to it as old when I was playing with it twenty years ago , so I know it 's pretty old , uh , called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis in which you {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} I think it 's used in social sciences a lot . So , you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you pick the best feature . And then {vocalsound} you take {disfmarker} y you find the next feature that 's the best in combination with it . And then so on and so on . And what {disfmarker} what Michael 's describing seems to me much , much better , because the problem with the stepwise discriminant analysis is that you don't know that {disfmarker} you know , if you 've {vocalsound} picked the right set of features . Just because something 's a good feature doesn't mean that you should be adding it . So , {vocalsound} um , {pause} uh , here at least you 're starting off with all of them , and you 're {vocalsound} throwing out useless features . I think that 's {disfmarker} that seems , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that seems like a lot better idea . Uh , you 're always looking at things in combination with other features . Um , so the only thing is , of course , there 's this {disfmarker} this artificial question of {disfmarker} of , uh , {vocalsound} exactly how you {disfmarker} how you a how you assess it and if {disfmarker} if your order had been different in throwing them out . I mean , it still isn't necessarily really optimal , but it seems like a pretty good heuristic . So I th I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} I think it 's kinda neat stuff ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , the thing that I wanted to {disfmarker} to add to it also was to have us use this in a multi - stream way ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Um , so {disfmarker} so that , um , {vocalsound} when you come up with these different things , {vocalsound} and these different functions , {vocalsound} you don't necessarily just put them all into one huge vector , but perhaps {vocalsound} you {vocalsound} have some of them in one stream and some of them in another stream , and so forth . And , um , um , {comment} um {disfmarker} And we 've also talked a little bit about , uh , {vocalsound} uh , Shihab Shamma 's stuff , in which {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} the way you look at it is that there 's these different mappings and some of them emphasize , uh , upward moving , {vocalsound} uh , energy and fre and frequency .

So I 've been working on integrating this mean subtraction approach into the SmartKom system . And there 's this question of , well , so , um , in my tests before with HTK I found it worked {disfmarker} it worked the best with about twelve seconds of data used to estimate the mean , but , we 'll often have less {comment} in the SmartKom system . Um . So I think we 'll use as much data as we have {pause} at a particular time , and we 'll {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we 'll concatenate utterances together , um , to get as much data as we possibly can from the user .

If we think twelve seconds is ideal we could train the models using twelve seconds to calculate the mean , to mean subtract the training data . Or we could , um , use some other amount . So {disfmarker} like I did an experiment where I , um , was using six seconds in test , um , but , for {disfmarker} I tried twelve seconds in train .

And , um , so , with the {disfmarker} the sampling rate I was using , one second or two seconds or four seconds is at a power of two um , number of samples and , um , I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll jus f for the ones in between I guess I 'll just zero - pad ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Mm - hmm .

Um {disfmarker} I didn't use the {disfmarker} the scheme that 's currently in the proposal because {vocalsound} I don't want to {disfmarker} In the proposal {disfmarker} Well , in {disfmarker} in the system we want to add like speech frame before every word and a little bit of {disfmarker} of , uh , s a couple of frames after also . Uh , but to estimate the performance of the VAD , we don't want to do that , because it would artificially increase the um {disfmarker} the false alarm rate of speech detection . Right ?

There is no entrance there , but it just happens to be the closest point of the road network to the geometric center Because that 's how the algorithm works .

That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it .

And , uh , uh , we have a lot more computational capability here than they do at OGI , so I think that i if {disfmarker} What 's {disfmarker} what 's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way , so that , uh , once these {disfmarker} all of these , you know , mundane but real problems get sorted out , we can just start turning the crank"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "and {disfmarker} and push all of us through , and then finally figure out what 's best ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah .

Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "right ? And you 're going through them all . That {disfmarker} that 's what I meant ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Right , right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "And , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , {vocalsound} concurrently on different machines , different SPERTs , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , \" OK , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , \" you 'll probably find you can't do it all ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Mm - hmm .

I mean , it wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something . But , probably when you include all the combinations , you 're actually talking about a thousand of them or something , and that 's probably more than we can do . Uh , but a hundred is a lot .

Yeah , so basically , uh , Chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where , and so on , and I 'll be the one who says , \" OK , spend the money . \" So . {vocalsound} Which , I mean , n these days , uh , if you 're talking about scratch space , it doesn't increase the , uh , need for backup , and , uh , I think it 's not that big a d and the {disfmarker} the disks themselves are not that expensive .

So there 's the slash - X - whatever disks , and then there 's slash - scratch . And both of those two kinds are not backed up . And if it 's called \" slash - scratch \" , it means it 's probably an internal disk to the machine . Um . And so that 's the kind of thing where , like if {disfmarker} um , OK , if you don't have an NT , but you have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a Unix workstation , and they attach an external disk , {comment} it 'll be called \" slash - X - something \" uh , if it 's not backed up and it 'll be \" slash - D - something \" if it is backed up . And if it 's inside the machine on the desk , it 's called \" slash - scratch \" . But the problem is , if you ever get a new machine , they take your machine away . It 's easy to unhook the external disks , put them back on the new machine , but then your slash - scratch is gone . So , you don't wanna put anything in slash - scratch that you wanna keep around for a long period of time . But if it 's a copy of , say , some data that 's on a server , you can put it on slash - scratch because , um , first of all it 's not backed up , and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine because you just recopy it to slash - scratch .

Dan {disfmarker} David , um , put a new , um , drive onto Abbott , that 's an X disk , which means it 's not backed up .

And , um , so far , um , I 've copied a couple of Carmen 's , um , databases over there . We haven't deleted them off of the slash - DC disk that they 're on right now in Abbott , um , uh , but we {disfmarker} I would like to go through {disfmarker} sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto , um , this new disk also .

Um ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "This being {disfmarker} ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "So , but {disfmarker} Uh .

And so , uh , if there 's something that would {disfmarker} would save some time that someone else could do on some other piece , then we should think of that first . See the thing with voiced - unvoiced - silence is I really think that {disfmarker} that it 's {disfmarker} to do {disfmarker} to do a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a poor job is {disfmarker} is pretty quick , uh , or , you know , a so - so job . You can {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker} you can throw in a couple fea we know what {disfmarker} what kinds of features help with it ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "You can throw something in .

Another year ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah , yeah . So , um {disfmarker} And th th the other tricky thing is , since we are , uh , even though we 're not {disfmarker} we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size , and {disfmarker} and computational complexity , uh , clearly there 's some limitation to it . So if we have to {disfmarker} if we say we have to have a pitch detector , say , if we {disfmarker} if we 're trying to incorporate pitch information , or at least some kind of harmonic {disfmarker} harmonicity , or something , this is another whole thing , take a while to develop . Anyway , it 's a very very interesting topic . I mean , one {disfmarker} I think one of the {disfmarker} a lot of people would say , and I think Dan would also , uh , that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is that we {disfmarker} we really do throw away all the harmonicity information . Uh , we try to get spectral envelopes . Reason for doing that is that most of the information about the phonetic identity is in the spectral envelopes are not in the harmonic detail . But the harmonic detail does tell you something . Like the fact that there is harmonic detail is {disfmarker} is real important . So . Um . So , uh . So I think {disfmarker} Yeah . So {disfmarker} wh that {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him {pause} work on the , uh , {pause} multilingual super f superset {pause} kind of thing . Uh , coming up with that and then , you know , training it {disfmarker} training a net on that , say , um , from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from TIMIT or something .

So if you know anyone interested in {disfmarker} in what i 'm about to describe , tell that person to {disfmarker} to write a mail to me or Jerry soon , fast . Um {vocalsound} the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks \" go shopping \" um \" take in uh a batch of art \" um \" visit {disfmarker} do some sightseeing \" blah - blah - blah - blah - blah , sort of analogous to what Fey has started in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in compiling {disfmarker} compiling here and already {disfmarker} she has already gone to the trouble of {disfmarker} of anchoring it with specific um o {comment} um entities and real world places you will find in Heidelberg . And um . So out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple , such as if {disfmarker} if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film , the person can then decide \" OK , I wanna do that at this place \" , sort of make up their own itinerary a and {disfmarker} and tasks and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h high level category list with them , but uh the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with {disfmarker} with symbols for the objects . And so , the person can maybe make a mental note that \" ah yeah I wanted to go shopping here \" and \" I wanted to maybe take a picture of that \" and \" maybe um eat here \" and then goes in and solves the task with the system , IE {comment} Fey , and um and we 're gonna try out that {disfmarker} Any questions ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "so um y you 'll have those say somewhere what their intention was {disfmarker} so you still have the {disfmarker} the nice thing about having data where you know what the actual intention was ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Mm - hmm . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "But they will um {disfmarker} There 's nothing that says you know \" these are the things you want to do \" so they 'll say \" well these are the things I want to do \" and {disfmarker} Right , so they 'll have a little bit more natural interaction ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Hopefully ."}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "OK . Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "So they 'll be given this map , which means that they won't have to like ask the system for in for like high level information about where things are ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah it 's a schematic tourist map . So it 'll be uh i it 'll still require the {disfmarker} that information and An"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "It w it doesn't have like streets on it that would allow them to figure out their way {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "N not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not really the street network . Nuh ."}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "So you 're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah a and um the map is more a means for them to have the buildings and their names and maybe some ma ma major streets and their names"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "and we want to maybe ask them , if you have {disfmarker} get it sort of isolated street the {disfmarker} the , whatever , \" River Street \" , and they know that {disfmarker} they have decided that , yes , that 's where they want to do this kind of action um that they have it with them and they can actually read them or sort of have the label for the object because it 's too hard to memorize all these st strange German names . And then we 're going to have another {disfmarker} we 're gonna have w another trial run IE the first with that new setup tomorrow at two and we have a real interesting subject which is Ron Kay for who {disfmarker} those who know him , he 's the founder of ICI .

OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Because what will happen then is that people repeat {disfmarker} repeat , {comment} or as much as they can , of that phrasing ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "Hmm .

That 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "Uh - huh .

I think everybody was focused elsewhere . Um , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a {disfmarker} a , uh {disfmarker} a filtering , which leads to a {disfmarker} a , uh {disfmarker} a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample . So , uh , as a result of that we have a reduced , um , transmission rate for the bits ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "That was misreported the first time out . It {disfmarker} it said the same amount because for convenience sake in the particular way that this is being tested , uh , they were repeating the packets .

Mm - hmm . Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "So , uh , in practice"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "So you could 've had a repeat count in there or something ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Well , n I mean , this was just a ph phoney thing just to {disfmarker} to fit into the {disfmarker} the software that was testing the errors {disfmarker} channel errors and so on ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Oh . Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "So {disfmarker} so in reality , if you put this {disfmarker} this system in into , uh , the field , it would be twenty - four hundred bits per second , not forty - eight hundred .

Or Hmm ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Uh , well that 's {pause} um yeah I mean , I think the question is \" Is there {disfmarker} is there some advantage ? \" I mean , you could just take the best system and say that 's the standard . But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things , um , a again within the constraint of the resources , if there 's something simple that you can do Now for instance , uh , it 's , I think , very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal 's side and then for the server 's side say , \" Here 's a number of things that could be done . \" So , um , everything that we did could probably just be added on to what Alcatel did , and i it 'd probably work pretty well with them , too . So , um , uh , that 's one {disfmarker} one aspect of it . And then on the terminal 's side , I don't know how much , um , memory and {disfmarker} and CPU it takes , but it seems like the filtering {pause} Uh , I mean , the VAD stuff they both had , right ? And , um , so {disfmarker} and they both had some kind of on - line normalization , right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Uh , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Of sorts , yeah ? So {disfmarker} so , it seems like the main different there is the {disfmarker} is the , uh , filtering . And the filtering {disfmarker} I think if you can {disfmarker} shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that Uh , and I also wouldn't think the CPU , uh , would be much either for that part . So , if you can {disfmarker} if you can add those in {pause} um {pause} then , uh , you can cut the data rate in half ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "So it seems like the right thing to do is to {disfmarker} on the {disfmarker} on the terminal 's side , take what they did , if it {disfmarker} if it does seem to generalize well to German and Danish , uh , take what they did add in a filter , and add in some stuff on the server 's side and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and that 's probably a reasonable standard . Um {pause} Uh"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "They are working on this already ? Because {disfmarker} yeah , Su - Sunil told me that he was trying already to put some kind of , uh , filtering in the {vocalsound} {pause} France Telecom ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Yeah , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's what That would be ideal {disfmarker} would be is that they could , you know , they could actually show that , in fact , a combination of some sort , {vocalsound} uh , would work even better than what {disfmarker} what any of the systems had . And , um , then it would {disfmarker} it would , uh {pause} be something to {disfmarker} to discuss in the meeting . But , uh , not clear what will go on . Um , I mean , on the one hand , um , sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there . I mean , you can always have another standard after that , but {vocalsound} this process has gone on for a while on {disfmarker} already and {disfmarker} and people might just wanna pick something and say , \" OK , this is it . \" And then , that 's a standard . Uh , standards are always optional . It 's just that , uh , if you disobey them , then you risk not being able to sell your product , or {pause} {vocalsound} Uh {pause} um And people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on . So it 's not final even if they declared a standard . The other hand , they might just say they just don't know enough yet to {disfmarker} to declare a standard . So you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you will be {disfmarker} you will become experts on this and know more {disfmarker} far more than me about the tha this particular standards process once you {disfmarker} you go to this meeting . So , be interested in hearing . So , uh , I 'd be , uh , interested in hearing , uh , your thoughts now I mean you 're almost done . I mean , you 're done in the sense that , um , you may be able to get some new features from Sunil , and we 'll re - run it . Uh , but other than that , you 're {disfmarker} you 're basically done , right ?

Actually , there is one thing that {disfmarker} well {pause} Um , generally we {disfmarker} we think that {vocalsound} most of the errors are within phoneme classes , and so I think it could be interesting to {disfmarker} to see if it {disfmarker} I don't think it 's still true when we add noise , and {vocalsound} so we have {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I guess the confusion ma the confusion matrices are very different when {disfmarker} when we have noise , and when it 's clean speech .
