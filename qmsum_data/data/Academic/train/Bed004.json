Some members ran a trial of it earlier and found someone who would make a suitable wizard. The team shared concern about how they would recruit non-university student participants. Grad D introduced the team to the second iteration of the bayes-net model and its schemas. Then, the discussion moved onto controlling the size of the bayes-net as it would otherwise be based on too much information. The team ended the meeting by delving into how the method of creating a Bayes-net in different scenarios could itself be abstracted, i.e. narrowing the input and output factors and the intermediate representation."

And pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh SmartKom , i that {disfmarker} that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there 's uh something about the intent {disfmarker} you know , the actual what people wanna do or what they 're referring to and stuff , in independent of whether it {disfmarker} about {disfmarker} what is this or where is it or something , that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you 're gonna use in a general way . So that 's the {disfmarker} You might . You might . You might be able to {disfmarker} to uh say that this i this is the kind of construction in which the {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} Let 's say there 's a uh cont there {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the land the construction implies the there 's a con this thing is being viewed as a container . OK . So just from this local construction you know that you 're gonna hafta treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information . And that may effect the way you process everything else . So if you say \" how do I get into the castle \" OK , then um {disfmarker} Or , you know , \" what is there in the castle \" or {disfmarker} so there 's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as a container and you 'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle 's referred to as a container , you crank up the appropriate stuff . Independent of what the goal is , and independent of what the surrounding language is ."
