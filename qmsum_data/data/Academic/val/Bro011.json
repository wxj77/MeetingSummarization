And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen .

So the majority of them wanna have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So {vocalsound} my guess {disfmarker} uh And then if you {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I printed out a confusion matrix um {vocalsound} uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that {vocalsound} you know , if you assume a fixed {disfmarker} the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh you 've got {disfmarker} you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case ,"
