The mean subtraction approach for SRI that relied on a twelve second interval resulted in a zero point three percent improvement over the six second model, not necessarily significant. The team thought that training the model on different speeds of speech would be helpful to add to this progress. Grad A introduced the team to her formal proposal for the qualifier exam. The work focused on intermediate classifiers and multi-band graphical models for speech recognition. The team then discussed noise removal as well The model PhD B was working on did not do well in non-stationary noise environments. In general, however, the model had improved. The VAD was labeling speech as silence segments, which could be attributed to alignment issues. The team thought that noise addition techniques might help the model."

So I 've been working on integrating this mean subtraction approach into the SmartKom system . And there 's this question of , well , so , um , in my tests before with HTK I found it worked {disfmarker} it worked the best with about twelve seconds of data used to estimate the mean , but , we 'll often have less {comment} in the SmartKom system . Um . So I think we 'll use as much data as we have {pause} at a particular time , and we 'll {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we 'll concatenate utterances together , um , to get as much data as we possibly can from the user . But , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} there 's a question of how to set up the models . So um , we could train the models . If we think twelve seconds is ideal we could train the models using twelve seconds to calculate the mean , to mean subtract the training data . Or we could , um , use some other amount . So {disfmarker} like I did an experiment where I , um , was using six seconds in test , um , but , for {disfmarker} I tried twelve seconds in train . And I tried , um , um , the same in train {disfmarker} I 'm a I tried six seconds in train . And six seconds in train {vocalsound} was about point three percent better . Um , and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um , it 's not clear to me yet whether that 's {vocalsound} something significant . So I wanna do some tests and , um , {vocalsound} actually make some plots of , um {disfmarker} for a particular amount of data and test what happens if you vary the amount of data in train ."

And I found {disfmarker} So the {disfmarker} the results that I 've shown here are the complete results using the new {disfmarker} Well , the n the new technique is nothing but the noise estimate scaled by a factor of point five .

And it may also be due to the alignment because {disfmarker} well , the reference alignment . Because right now I just use an alignment obtained from {disfmarker} from a system trained on channel zero . And I checked it a little bit but there might be alignment errors . Um , yeah , e like the fact that {vocalsound} {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the models tend to align their first state on silence and their last state o on silence also . So the reference {disfmarker} reference alignment would label as speech some silence frame before speech and after speech .

Mmm , and then I have two sheets where it 's for a system where {disfmarker} uh , so it 's again the same system . But in this case we have spectral subtraction with a maximum overestimation factor of two point five . Uh , there is smoothing of the gain trajectory with some kind of uh , low - pass filter , which has forty milliseconds latency . And then , after subtraction um , I add a constant to the energies and I have two cases d where {disfmarker} The first case is where the constant is twenty - five DB below the mean speech energy and the other is thirty DB below .
