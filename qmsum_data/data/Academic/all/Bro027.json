The team began with a discussion about how reverberation could be better accounted for. The professor thought that experimenting with different filters could help achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio. The new system for estimating silence probabilities that the team had added to the model was very effective, but it created a 220ms latency in the VAD. The team was not sure what kinds of constraints would be placed on latency eventually. They wanted to play it safe. The models, over all, were performing well, though the team intended to keep improving them. The team was also trying to figure out how to deal with different kinds of background noise. The meeting ended with a discussion of logistical issues."
