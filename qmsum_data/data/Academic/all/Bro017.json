The professor outlined the specific methodology. At the time, the team was focused on testing for C-zero and C-one only, but they decided to expand their testing.

And that 's how you make uh decisions . That 's why the articulatory events , which uh F F Fletcher talks about , they are about two critical bands . You need at least two , basically . You need some relative , relative relation ."
