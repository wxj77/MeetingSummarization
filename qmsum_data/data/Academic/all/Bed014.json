On the other hand, future collaboration on belief-nets has already been agreed with another research group. The construction analysis and formalism are also progressing. Several issues that have been dealt with were mentioned during the meeting: indefinite pronouns and wh-questions, noun-phrase structure, etc. This analysis is being done with the help of a linguist, who often provides different perspectives to methods and terminology."

So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff , so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you 've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate {pause} uh , belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate . But that 's g that 's , as far as I can tell , it 's {disfmarker} it 's putting together two real hard problems . One is the linguistic part of what are the couplings and {disfmarker} and when you have a certain , uh , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings , you know , between let 's say between the past and the present , or any other one of these things and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work if it 's got um , let 's say one in {disfmarker} in , you know , different tenses or my beliefs and your beliefs , or any of these other ones of {disfmarker} of multiple models . So um you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion is that we start digging into them both , uh , in a way we that , you know , th hopefully turns out to be consistent , so that the {disfmarker} Um .

Then there is the {pause} really clever way that was suggested by Keith and then there is the , uh , middle way that I 'm suggesting and that is you {disfmarker} you get X , which is whatever , the castle . The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours , that they have admission fees , they have whatever . And then , this is {disfmarker} We go via a thesaurus and look up {pause} certain linguistic surface structures {pause} that are related to these concepts and feed those through the dialogue history and check dynamically for each e entity . We look it up check whether any of these were mentioned and then activate the corresponding nodes on the discourse side . But Keith suggested that a {disfmarker} a much cleaner way would be {disfmarker} is , you know , to keep track of the discourse in such a way that you {disfmarker} if you know that something like that ha has been mentioned before , this just a continues to add up , you know , in th in a {disfmarker}"
