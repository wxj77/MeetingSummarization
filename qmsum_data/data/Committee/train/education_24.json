The meeting started by discussing thoroughly about the use of pupil development grant funding in different sectors and the meeting believed that PDG would largely cover each aspect of students' rights and support the school services at the same time. Later, the meeting also agreed about the PDG's contribution to special kids and more able and talented streams. The meeting also talked about changes in key positions to ensure smooth adoption of the new curriculum. In the end, several issues regarding different phases of education and connection between different sectors were brought up and currently, they would work out the final stage."

Using the same measuring method, in 2017, there was a re-widening of the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals.

Nearly three quarters of primary schools were doing well and about half of secondary schools were the same. The reason seemed to be there was a widening of gaps when it moved from primary to secondary, but also it was from foundation phase to key stage 2 to key stage 3 to key stage 4. To conclude, Meilyr Rowlands suggested that a whole range of issues should be considered to help explain what had been identified about the gap.",

            "speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands",
            "content": "Thank you for the question. This grant has been targeted far better by now than it was originally. Estyn has made several reports regarding the effectiveness of the grant, and, really, going back to before this specific grant, to a similar grant, called RAISE. At the start of this grant, the funding was often spent on tackling underachievement, rather than dealing with the underachievement of children who are eligible for free school meals specifically. But, over a period of time, we have seen that it is targeted much better by now. That's not to say that the targeting is working perfectly still, and I think that we are seeing examples where the targeting isn't going just to children who receive free school meals. Schools sometimes interpret poverty in a slightly wider way than that. In terms of what schools are doing with the grant, we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things that they are doing. They are tracking progress of pupils, they are trying to improve attendance, they are trying to work with families and the community in general, they're doing work specifically to improve how\u00a0children are doing in exams, in key stage 4, specifically\u2014a lot of funding is being spent on that\u2014improving the confidence of students, taking students on extra-curricular activities, improving literacy and numeracy. Those are the kinds of activities they're being used for."

But you are relatively comfortable with the fact that there is sufficient targeting happening. You referred to the fact that it is used, perhaps, to reach a slightly wider cohort than just those who are eligible for free school meals, but you do feel that that balance, from your experience, is acceptable."
        },
        {
            "speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands",
            "content": "Yes, certainly, it has improved a great deal. When I was looking at this initially, the targeting wasn\u2019t happening at all. It was being spent on children who were underachieving, and one of the things that we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was being spent on boys than girls. And, of course, that raised the question immediately that it wasn't being spent then on children who are eligible for free school meals, because those\u00a0numbers are equal. So, it wasn\u2019t, but it has improved. There is a discussion about who exactly should have it and whether free school meals is the best definition. So, I think that schools are perhaps not following that exactly, but within the spirit of the grant, I think I\u2019m fairly comfortable. There is a specific question\u2014I don\u2019t know if you are going to ask this\u2014regarding more able and talented pupils."

There are a number of reasons for this, I think. One of them is that there\u2019s still some feeling that less able children should be receiving this grant, children who are underachieving. Schools don\u2019t always identify underachievement of those more able children. It seems that they are doing okay, but if they were given more support, they would do even better."

Or is it the regime that focuses on exam results and the need to draw those pupils who are underachieving up, rather than incentivising those who are achieving\u00a0to achieve better?"

            "speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands",

I was in a conference for headteachers last week, where there was new data being discussed, and that data showed the progress of children from a certain point, year 6 tests. I think that kind of data will be very useful, because what that data can do is help secondary schools to identify\u00a0more able children and that they are underachieving. Even though they're doing quite well, that kind of value-added data is very useful. So, I think that that will help as well."

For example, in last year's annual report I raised it, and a lot of the debate around this now, I think, was generated by some of the things I've said in previous annual reports. We gave a lot of evidence to the\u2014. Paul Flynn, I think, did the\u2014no, who did the report? Paul Murphy did the report. So, we gave evidence to that. And on Seren, I'm particularly proud that my alma mater, Jesus College, is a very strong supporter of the Seren work. So, I'm personally quite interested in the work of Seren. And we look at the performance of more able pupils in all our inspections.\u00a0It's a particular part\u00a0of our inspection framework\u2014looking at the relative performance of different groups. So, we look at the different performance of boys and girls, free school meals and non-free school meals, ethnic minorities, but we also look at the performance\u00a0of more able pupils in particular, and we question schools about how they provide for the more able pupils, and we've referred to Seren in several of our inspection reports."

For example, some people say that if you have received free school meals for a period of time and now you're not receiving them, then perhaps you should still be receiving the\u00a0funding for a period of time, for example.

So, schools do a lot of things\u00a0that they are in control of\u2014the things I mentioned earlier: things like improving attendance, offering extra-curricular activities, literacy and numeracy support, tracking pupils\u2014all those sorts of things. But an important element of this, I think, is engaging with the learners, but also with parents and the community.

In Brackla Primary School, in Bridgend, they've got Families at Brackla, and it's a range of activities to engage with families. Families often have had a negative experience of education themselves, and the schools are trying to address some of those concerns. Cefn Hengoed\u00a0in Swansea, which I'm sure many of you know about, have had an extensive strategy for engaging with the community, with the families, and equipping their children to participate in decisions around the curriculum, making them more confident learners. So, it is about removing the barriers for disadvantaged learners."

I think that acknowledges this general point. But what a lot of schools did with this money was precisely that, to target key stage 4\u2014to have catch-up homework clubs, revision clubs, specifically to get children better GCSE results, and getting C grades, in particular. Of course, that is an important part of your armoury of tools to use, but I think there was too much use of that. Part of the problem with that is that it doesn't either develop the long-term transferable skills that those pupils have, or should have, nor does it produce the kinds of skills that the teachers need as well. So, it's kind of a quick win, a quick-fix solution, while what we feel would be more effective in the long term, and more sustainable in the long term\u2014because if this money goes, then those quick fixes won't be possible\u2014what would be more effective in the long term is to improve the curriculum and the pedagogy, the quality of the teaching, the quality of the curriculum, so that children are naturally enthused by what is on offer, that they attend better because they want to be in school, that they want to learn. So, we feel that getting the curriculum right, tailoring the curriculum to the needs of the pupils in that area, and improving teaching, is a more sustainable long-term solution."

I think that, generally, schools can do much more about using evidence and research findings, but this particular area is probably the one that schools are strongest at using research in. That's partly because the guidance strongly suggests that you should do that, but also because there is a lot of easily accessible research evidence available. So, there's a lot of research on this. As I mentioned earlier, the Sutton Trust toolkit is a good example where researchers have really tried very hard to simplify all the evidence that exists in a way that schools can use. So, there are little pound signs to show how costly an intervention is and little stars or something to show how many months of gain pupils get out of this particular intervention. So, it makes it much easier for schools to make a decision. But I think what's missing is that you can't just take that evidence as it is, because you have to implement it in your own school, and that then will affect how effective that particular intervention is. Just because it is evaluated by researchers as being generally very effective doesn't mean that you will necessarily implement it effectively. So, it is therefore important that each school does evaluate. So, there are kind of two sides to using research. There's looking at research, but there's also doing your own research and evaluating how effectively\u00a0you have implemented something. I think that's been a weakness."

Whether you say that that is due to PDG or not is quite difficult, but there have been some improvements. But there hasn't been a major step change in closing that gap, that is true, and I think the conclusion that I draw is that these are major societal challenges and barriers that these young people face. Schools can do a certain amount, and of course they must do a certain amount, but to have a step change you do need to engage with the learners, with the parents and with the community and that's why the more successful schools do actually succeed\u2014it's because they do that.

So, you've all heard about BTEC Science and the key skills qualifications. Those sorts of things that many of these pupils used to succeed at, and therefore get the performance indicator for the school, no longer count.

What needs to be done is to have a different approach to accountability that doesn't put so much attention on these performance indicators, because what you're doing is you're just moving the problem around by changing the performance indicators. Some of these vocational courses that I mentioned are a good example of this. So, I think the previous performance indicators encouraged schools to enter, for example, whole cohorts to do BTEC science, and that's not a good idea because the GCSE sciences are better\u00a0preparation to go on to A-level science, for example. So, you're cutting out the possibility of progression for those pupils.\u00a0On the other hand, by discouraging\u2014the new performance indicators discourage BTEC and now people are saying, 'We're not offering BTEC at all', and it is suitable for a certain cohort of pupils.

It strikes me that the decision to discourage the availability of BTEC, which is what the performance measures do, really is sending a message about vocational qualifications that is not helpful, actually, to many young people for whom vocational qualifications may be perfectly suitable. Is that something with which you concur?"

So, you can sympathise with the original decision to change the performance indicators in such a way that it encouraged more pupils to do GCSEs, for example, but it does have that unintended consequence. In theory, there's nothing stopping a school entering pupils now for those qualifications."

They are improving their tracking of looked-after children. There's an issue about adopted children, I think, because, currently, the pupil-level annual school census data doesn't differentiate whether children are adopted or not.

There were improvements overall for the 40 schools over and above the general improvement that there was for all schools in Wales. So, you could say\u00a0that\u00a0it was successful in that respect. So, it's quite difficult to say whether it was successful, because that was a fairly limited improvement for quite a lot of money. It is, you know, quite a difficult judgment to say whether it was successful or not overall. What strikes one, I think, was the variability in the success of it, and I think that was clear also at an operational level. It was clearly more successful in certain areas where all the various people involved in the work worked together effectively. So, the challenge adviser and the local authority and the regional consortia were all working effectively together.

That has developed and\u00a0clarified over time, but at that time it wasn't entirely clear. Plus, you were bringing in another player to the school improvement landscape. When all of those different agencies worked well together, then that was a positive\u00a0thing for schools. When they were all saying the same thing, having that extra resource, extra money, extra attention, was a positive\u00a0thing; but, clearly, in some cases, that relationship\u00a0didn't always work, and some schools felt that they were being told different\u00a0things by different agencies.

And I think that that general shift from the foundations\u2014of literacy and numeracy\u2014moving towards the curriculum and pedagogy does make sense. And the other trend that we've seen is to promote collaboration and the self-improvement system, as it's called.

I think that the most striking aspect in looking back over the past seven years is that all aspects of work in the education system\u2014I'm trying to avoid saying 'schools', because it's more than just schools; it's colleges and the system as a whole\u2014have changed.\u00a0All aspects of that have changed, and I think that we need that\u2014all of those aspects need to be changed and improved\u2014but we need to balance that against the fact that we need to not go so fast, because workload on teachers\u2014. This responsibility of self-improvement means that there is more pressure on teachers and headteachers, ultimately.

Perhaps 'revolutionary' is too strong a word, but it is the biggest change that I've seen in my career. You have to go back to the 1980s and 1990s to see similar changes. Of course, we all wish to see swifter progress being made, but what that means in practice is that you push more changes through, or that you push through the changes that we currently have more quickly. There was discussion, for example, about when the new curriculum should be introduced. Those are the kinds of practical questions that arise, and you have to remember that, in the classroom, what you will have are individual teachers having to prepare for a new GCSE, a new A-level, and there are new specifications in that regard, and it's a great deal of work. So, we have to be very careful when we say that we need to accelerate that process."

Well, I think one of the things, and it's difficult to answer that question, but one of the things that hasn't worked in the past is just doing one aspect of the system. We need to look at transforming the entire education system\u00a0at the same time,\u00a0because if you just tinker with one part then it might have an unintended effect in another place.

So, that does give one confidence that they will be able to cope with other changes in future. So, I am confident in that sense, but we do have to be careful in looking out for the workload, because the culture of promoting is one of giving more responsibilities to teachers, to schools, to colleges and to headteachers.

So, I think it's a good thing to do at any given time, but considering the range and speed of change that we're facing in education now, I thought it was particularly important that we ask Graham Donaldson to look at the implications for our work of all this education reform."

But, we are disappointed that only about a quarter of primary schools are implementing it fully. There's a whole range of reasons, as I discuss in the annual report, why that might be the case.\u00a0It is quite an innovative idea, and I think it's misunderstood by saying it's learning through play, because that's a bit too simplistic a definition of it. We have written a report recently on good practice in the foundation phase, so that we can try and explain clearly to people what the benefits of it are and how best to implement it. But I think it is true that too many headteachers\u2014. Many of them might not have taught in foundation phase, they might not have that infant background, they might have a junior-school background. There might not have been enough\u2014well, we say there wasn't enough training\u2014or there might be people who missed any training that there was then.

We mentioned some of them earlier this morning. I've puzzled about this. I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding about the term 'community-focused school'. I think it became thought of as meaning the community just uses the facilities in the evening and, of course, it's a much, much broader concept than that. I think some schools particularly didn't like the community using their facilities in the evening, and that became, I think, possibly part of the reason why community-focused schools didn't become more popular. The way I look at it is, as Claire was explaining earlier about the school offering all kinds of services to people\u2014you know, family learning, those sorts of nurture groups, all those sorts of educationally focused services available from the school, and generally building relationships. They're more to do with the culture than the actual building and the facilities. But, yes, we certainly have seen and identified where that good practice exists."

            "content": "I'm not sure if there's been a difference in the rate of improvement, but certainly I've raised in this annual report, and indeed in previous annual reports, the difference between primary and secondary. We've got 7 in 10\u2014nearly three quarters\u2014of primary schools doing well and about half of secondary schools. So, I did open debate on why that is the case in last year's annual report. There are several reasons, I think. Generally, there is a widening of gaps when you go from primary to secondary, but also it's from foundation phase to key stage 2 to key stage 3 to key stage 4. There's a general widening\u00a0of the gender gap, for example. There's a widening\u00a0of the free-school-meals gap and so forth. So, there are particular\u00a0challenges facing secondary schools that don't exist in primary. I should say that what you get in secondary schools is greater variability. So, there's actually more excellence in secondary schools according to our inspections than in primary, although the overall proportion of good or better schools is higher in primary than in secondary. So, I think it is a challenge to think why this is the case. It's partly because\u00a0of the challenges of adolescent, young people. That is part of it. I think also, although I've got no evidence for this, it's probably\u00a0more difficult\u00a0for that community focus to work in a larger secondary school than a smaller primary school. You go to primary schools, you often see the parents much more engaged than in secondary school. So, I think that's a bit more of a challenge as well. So, there is a whole range of issues. The other one,\u00a0of course,\u00a0is the one we were talking about earlier this morning, the pressure on secondary schools to address performance indicators and examinations in particular. Another possible reason is the structure\u00a0of secondary schools is subject-based, departmental-based, so children will get 10 to 12 different teachers. In primary school, for a whole year, they will have the same teacher. It's easier, therefore, in a primary school for the school to see the child as an individual\u00a0and recognise their problems and their needs as a whole. So, I think there is a whole range of issues that explains or goes part way to explaining\u00a0what you've identified."

It's a very successful sector. The small number of schools that don't do quite as well tend to be the schools that deal with children with emotional and behavioural difficulties. But the sector as a whole is a good example of sharing good practice. They work very, very well together. They're constantly\u2014. It's difficult to say why that is in this particular sector, as opposed to other sectors. Possibly they don't have an overlap in catchment areas, they're quite geographically\u00a0separate, so they don't feel as if they're in competition with one another. But they certainly work very well together, sharing good practice, doing peer reviews of each other. So, it is a successful sector."

The independent sector tends to focus maybe on those children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, so they have the more difficult task to begin with. But because they're independent, they are, to some extent, in competition with one another. So, we have seen improvement in that independent special sector over the cycle. That's partly down to the work we do in Estyn. We visit them on an annual basis to make sure that they're addressing all our recommendations, and continue to meet the needs of those pupils. And also, I think there's been a trend where more of those independent schools now have\u2014. Several of them have the same owner, so they share good practice amongst that little chain of schools. So, that has been a trend we've seen over time as well."

We've contributed a lot of evidence to the various working groups that have been looking at EOTAS\u2014that's education other than at school. Half the children in EOTAS\u2014educated other than at school\u2014are in PRUs. So, we've done a lot of work about that. ADEW, which is the\u00a0Association of Directors of Education in Wales, have now set up a national body to share good practice amongst PRUs, so I think that is a very positive step forward, because that sharing, I think, wasn't happening with PRUs. I think what we need to do with PRUs is to get them to be more of a part of the education system as a whole. They tend to be sort of semi-detached a little bit from the system. So, the more we can do to involve them in national events, and also, I think, make their governance more like that of a school so that they become more similar to schools\u2014that makes it easier for them to share practice with schools."

That leadership, I think\u00a0the characteristics we have seen in the 'good' or 'better'\u2014as you say, 80 per cent leadership good or better\u2014has been a culture of openness, a culture of clarity of purpose about where the college is going. High staff morale has been maintained, because a number of those colleges\u2014. Obviously, if you're merging large colleges as they did in north Wales, keeping staff morale high is quite a skill, and I think\u00a0the leadership have done that very well. They've also supported managers at all levels, and they've encouraged managers to support staff at all levels. So, it's become a very collaborative, very supportive organisation. I think another characteristic of the FE sector is that\u00a0it's got very strong governance arrangements. I did a training\u00a0session for college governors about a month ago, and what struck me was the breadth of experience of the college governors, from industry, from academia. They are a very\u00a0challenging set of governors, I think, who hold the senior leadership\u00a0to account in the colleges, and that helps to push standards forward. Teaching is 'good' or 'better' in 70 per cent\u00a0of colleges because the\u00a0senior leadership team are encouraging\u00a0teachers in colleges to innovate, encouraging them to engage actively in performance management\u00a0systems, and to become reflective practitioners in the colleges. And this is impacting, obviously, on the standards at the end of the day. So, I think those are the key features."

            "content": "Yes, there is a contrast. And we do have concerns about work-based learning. And, again, those concerns tend to sit mainly with the leadership. As we said in the\u00a0annual report, standards are 'good' or 'better' in only 50 per cent of work-based learning companies, mainly because the completion rates of learners are not what we'd expect, the progression that learners\u00a0make isn't what we'd expect. And that is mainly\u00a0due to the way in which the leadership teams monitor progress\u2014monitor progress in themselves\u00a0as a provider, but, more importantly, the way they\u00a0manage sub-contractors, because, as you will already know, there's 19 lead providers; there's about 100 training providers. And the companies that are doing better, or the training providers doing better, are those\u00a0that have got a firm grip on their sub-contractors, and, most importantly, they put quality as the top part of any agenda at any meeting. And, of course, if you're challenging your sub-contractors about\u00a0quality, that will impact\u00a0on standards of teaching, and, hopefully, ultimately, on standards of performance on the learners. And I think, to go back\u00a0to your original question, Llyr, the sort of leadership models that FE colleges have, I think\u00a0some of the work-based learning providers would be wise to start to emulate those. It's beginning\u00a0to happen, because\u00a0FE is getting more engaged in the work-based learning world, so I think some of those behaviours will start to rub off on the companies."

The Welsh Government is looking at the implementation of Hazelkorn's recommendations. So, ultimately, that will start to drive the sectors closer together in post-16. But I think, in the shorter term, some of the work that groups like Colegau Cymru and the National Training Federation Wales\u00a0are doing, sharing best practice, bringing the colleges and the training companies together, is beginning to help. I'm going to the national training federation conference tomorrow in Cardiff, and I notice the attendance there\u2014there's a lot of FE colleges attending, senior staff of FE colleges, as well as from the work-based training companies. So, that sort of osmosis of good practice is beginning to happen quite naturally."

One of our concerns, apart from the fact that there was a large turnover of directors, was what sort of level of training senior leaders and middle managers were getting in those authorities. One of the things that I'm quite pleased to report is that the Association of Directors of Education in Wales and Welsh Government have\u00a0stepped up to address that issue. Last year, all serving directors attended residential courses run by the Staff College Wales, facilitated by ADEW, and ADEW have just finished the first round of director\u2014. The name of the course is the 'Welsh future leaders in education' course and 26 people have just finished that\u2014aspiring directors. They're preparing for another cohort in September. That course, again, is developed by the Staff College Wales, but it has a lot of external input. They're putting in directors and chief executives from Scotland, they're putting in headteachers of very successful schools in England, who've got current grass-roots experience to share with these aspiring directors. So, I think the concerns that we had previously about the professional learning for middle managers and leaders in local authorities are being addressed. The proof will be in the pudding when we start to do the inspection cycle, but at least the issue now is being tackled."

To be fair, over the past couple of years, the consortia are now collaborating much closer together. They are working together\u2014for example, I mentioned earlier about the regional co-ordinators for LAC. Those four people are meeting regularly. So, they've all got different co-ordination roles in their regions. Whereas before they were working more in silos, they are now working much closer together.\u00a0So, I think what we were referring to, and what we were talking about in the report, is the fact that the consortia need to have a more consistent approach across all four regions.

We've picked up that GwE, for example,\u00a0is in the process of renaming their challenge advisers 'support advisers',\u00a0because they're moving their culture more over to supporting schools to deal with all the raft of reforms that Meilyr mentioned, and that is,\u00a0it seems to me, an entirely sensible way to go."
