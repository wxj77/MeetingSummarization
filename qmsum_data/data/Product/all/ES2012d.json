It included buttons for channel change, power, menu and also had a slider for volume, an infra-red section and a microphone. The cover was interchangeable with a company logo on it. It was also made of a rubbery material and could stretch over. Then Project Manager went through the costs of various aspects of design and argued that a slight compromise could be made as the remote control would be a fashion accessory and have interchangeable covers. After that, Marketing specifically summed up the evaluation criteria of remote control. Finally, Project Manager concluded and praised the teamwork results."
