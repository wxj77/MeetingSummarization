Then, Project Manager started a group discussion about the demand for teletext and video, for which thick key design was accepted as a feasible solution.

Then, Project Manager announced that according to the account manager, teletext could be included in the discussion, though its obsolescence incurred doubts over its usability and necessity. After that, Project Manager offered a choice question between television and further recording devices represented by DVDs, VCRs, and hard disk recorders. Finally, to cater for the younger people, User Interface devised big thick keys for RC in imitation of mobile phones, which received positive feedback from other team members.",

Under this circumstance, Project Manager put forward two options, one of which was to stop at the television phase, and the other was to go further to the phase of the recording device.

First, considering the tight budget, Marketing described the product as a cheap-end remote control, which would hardly gain the advantage over competitors in functionality.

However, Project Manager said that the group could make an attempt to provide a basic version of universal control, which could switch between stereo, VC, and TV.
