Firstly, the Project Manager mentioned new requirements including one recognizable button in the middle, the handy design, rubber materials and they would not use teletext. Next, Marketing presented on functional requirements including a fancy look, ease of use, and the LCD as well as speech recognition. Then, Industrial Designer introduced technical design and working design on remote interfaces. Lastly, User Interface presented on component design and the group decided to adopt a user-centered approach to reduce the main buttons and put a big circle in the middle with the power button, channel, and volume buttons."
