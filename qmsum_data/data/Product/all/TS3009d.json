Firstly, the Industrial Designer introduced the prototype of the product. It had not only the round basic shape which was made of hard plastics and titanium using different colors, but also the buttons like channel and volumn. Later, the group discussed some details and changes of redesigning the logo, buttons and screens. Next, the Marketing Expert mentioned the exterior of the product, the material attraction, and how easy it was to learn or use the basic functions of the product. Besides, the group discussed some details of the cost of components and made the product cheaper by replacing the titanium by hard plastics with similar color. They finally got an estimate of fourteen point one Euros, which was above the budget. In the end, they discussed the distinction between the product and other devices, and celebrated the completion of the project."
