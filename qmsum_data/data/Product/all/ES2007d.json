Next, they discussed the cost of the remote which only cost ten seventy euros a unit and well under the budget of twelve fifty. Then, the team evaluated the remote according to seven criteria and it passed with flying colours as three criteria scored a one and others no more than three. Finally, the meeting ended with team building and a wrap-up, which Project Marketing concluded that the novel remote fit all criteria and the team did a great job."

The prototype was also easy and convenient to use as the important keys were right at the fingers. On the other hand, it brought fashion to electronics as the remote was offered in colours of black, yellow, blue and red, which contained fruit and vegetable elements. It was innovative and looked different so it would stand out from other remotes in the market.",
