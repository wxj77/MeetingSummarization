Firstly, Marketing presented on the market trend and suggested a remote control with a fancy look and feel, technology innovation, and spongy material. Next, User Interface presented on conceptual design and recommended the control itself should use an inconsistent colour scheme. Then, Industrial Designer presented on the component design and that the cost, the complexity, and the size would have an impact on their remote design and reminded there would be a restriction on grouping plastic and rubber cases together. Lastly, the group discussed remote concepts and decided to have a small size remote with the speaker, the chip on print for the power, and a rubber case."

Um and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um {vocalsound} techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . Sort of like a {disfmarker} I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . Um {disfmarker} Does that make sense ? Yeah . So {vocalsound} so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their {disfmarker} what people associate this {disfmarker} them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that ."
