First, it was the Industrial Designer's presentation on energy source and case material ; then, User Interface introduced potential buttons, the layout design, and the color of the remote control ; and at last, Marketing made a presentation on three important marketing points that the team should pay attention to, which are fancy appearance, innovative technology and user-friendliness. Various discussions went on among team members concerning their presentations."

Each kind of energy source has its own advantages and disadvantages. The basic battery costs less, and the kinetic provision of energy could be cooler and fancier. Regarding the design of the case, Industrial Designer claimed that it could be a general fact one, a curved one or a double curved one which is more ergonomic. Concerning the material of the case, Industrial Designer claimed that it could be plastic, latex, rubber, wood or titanium. At last they decided that the control is going to be a double curved rubber case, with rubber push-buttons and basic battery.",

The team vetoed the idea of the speech recognition interface which is expensive and unnecessary. At last the team decided not to have any sort of display, but a simple straight set of push-buttons, with a power, channel up, channel down, volume up, volume down, a numerical keypad, and a lock button or a cover. Then they discussed some supplements like colours or particular gimmicky bits. User Interface proposed the utilization of a couple of colours like black and yellow, with special parts like the RR logo in yellow. User Interface suggested having a rubber case for safety reasons.",

            "answer": "Marketing made a presentation on  important aspects the team need to pay attention to concerning the remote control market. A most important aspect is its look and feel, so that the remote control has to look and feel fancier to meet customer's demands. The second point is that it should be technologically innovative. And then they found that the decisions the team had already made on interface didn't match the first two points that Marketing had raised. Then they discussed the Bluetooth function which was turned down and on the kinetic provision of energy. User Interface suggested using squeezable rubber which could be an energy generator. The third point that Marketing raised was easy to use. She suggested that next year's fashion would be fruits and vegetables so the team had the idea of making some buttons into fruit shapes. Regarding the color of the control, Project Manager had the idea of marketing the control in different colors for different groups of people like iPod.",

However, Project Manager reckoned that the Bluetooth function means that users  need a television that has Bluetooth function. Televisions rarely have this function. Marketing thought that it would be a new trend and they need to move away from what they already had and go creative. But after all the proposal of Bluetooth was suspended.",
