Marketing shared feedback about the design of the device. Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the design and availability of actual components, whereas User Interface led the discussion about customer needs and feasibility on design and competitors' study. A final decision was reached regarding the design of the remote control such as using kinetic charging and a rubber cover."

Two separate circuit boards will be joined by wires for standard and complex buttons respectively. Fruit and vegetable colours, such as chilli red or tomato red will be used for the rubber cover and the case will be plastic. The company logo will be incorporated into the design. The team hoped to incorporate voice recognition but financial feasibility will have to be checked and whistles or beepers could be used if not feasible."

The image of the company is to be incorporated in the design and a flip design is decided. Voice recognition is left out. The shape of the remote will be different than normal, like a shell or something along those lines. An alarm will be added in case the remote is lost.

On the other hand, most current remotes use a silicone printed circuit board (PCB board) which connects the circuits so that the messages would be sent to the chip.

Solar charging is the second cheapest but not resistant to dropping. Also, Project Manager believed it would limit the market. Kinetic charging is small and portable but market research should be done first. No rechargeable battery options were available.

The new remote will have a graphic user interface in the middle of the flip top and certain standard buttons with vibrant fruit colours.

They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .

So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .
