Both the devices had the special shape, like the surf-board. The first prototype was a pretty simple design with LCD display and a conventional layout of buttons. The second prototype was advanced in its speech recognition function and looked like a fashion mobile phone. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test, focusing on its look and feel, innovation and ease of use and the team were asked to give one to seven points to each feature of the product to compare the two prototypes. Thirdly, the team calculated the cost of both the prototypes and found that the second one had exceeded the budget to a great extent. As a result they discussed and voted a lot to discard the advanced functions and eliminate the number of the push buttons, which made the budget under control."

            "answer": "Both the devices had the special shape, like the surf-board. The first prototype was a pretty simple design with LCD display and an on-off button in red. It was easy to use and could only be used for the TV mode. After all, the team concluded that it was a standard design except for its special shape that made it look adorable. On the contrary, the second prototype was advanced in its speech recognition function and looked like a fashion mobile phone. It came with six key buttons and one orange one for the microphone. If the user would like a speech recognition and a lot of information on the channel could be displayed directly on LCD display. Also, the components for the two designs were low in weight and there was LED to indicate the battery usage, making it convenient to use. To conclude, Marketing fancied the second one's size and shape.",

            "answer": "Marketing recalled what the team had identified as being important to sell the product for both the devices and made a list of features from the marketing point of view. For both of the prototypes, Marketing asked the team to give one to seven points to each feature of the product and the lower the points the better the feature. For instance, look and feel, innovation and ease of use, were the three important components that Marketing wanted the team to discuss about. This might help with the conclusion whether the product was appealing to the correct demographic and incorporated the fashion trend into it.",

            "answer": "The team agreed that although the cover was movable, the case design was moderate. Also, the way the device could be held was not attractive and easy for all, since the left-handed people would choose to use it with the other hand, which made it really annoying. When it came to innovation, Industrial Designer believed basically there was no innovation in the first one compared to what existed in the market. However, the second design was extremely innovative as it had incorporated all the scrolling buttons and its automatic speech recognition function. Besides, the two products aimed at the target customers well, with the first standard one for the old group while the second one for those between twenty to forty five. Lastly, the team concluded that they had successfully answered the company's philosophy of having the fashion in electronics.",

            "answer": "The first design obviously met the requirements of the budget so the team focused on the second one to see whether the combination of the two designs could together form an innovative design but was under the budget at the same time. To cut costs, the Project Manager first suggested using normal chips only in exchange for the speech recognition function. The special color was left to the case and it was designed as curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well. Later, the team had argued a lot whether to eliminate the number of buttons or to discard LCD displays. However, if the number of buttons were to be eliminated, it would be far more complicated to use the device, since users must press one button several times to get to the channel. After a vote and discussion about the cost, the team decided to discard both the LCD display and the speech recognition functions since they were really expensive and the later one could not work without the existence of the former one.",
