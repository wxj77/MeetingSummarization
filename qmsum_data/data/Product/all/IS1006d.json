First, the user interface designer displayed the appearance and the texture of the product with a working prototype. After that, the industrial designer gave some technical specifications on the product. In the product evaluation that included several criteria, the controller got an average score of two point one seven, which implied it was good. When it came to the quotation of product components, the original one was seventeen dot eight dollars, which was apparently over budget. After some discussions about battery and operations on the calculator, the group finally cut the cost down to under twelve dollars.
