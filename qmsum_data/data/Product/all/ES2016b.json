According to market research, Marketing suggested adopting modern appearance, reducing buttons, increasing positioning and voice recognition functions. From the perspective of technical function design, User Interface emphasized that the user should be the centre, reduce the buttons, focus on modifying the shape of the remote control, and do not waste the budget to design the universal remote controller. Industrial Designer had come up with the option of cheap and sustainable batteries, infrared lights and voice recognition technology. Industrial Designer also offered mouse-like scrolling and clicking functions, as well as specific remote control shapes."

The remote control needed an energy source to supply power to the integrated circuit, and had a chip and related information to control the infrared lamp. In the design, it can make the battery and infrared lamp cheaper and more sustainable. It can also add the design of speech recognition interface according to the market research provided by Marketing.",

In order to be distinctive, the team can adopt a spherical or keyboard shape design. Based on the market research, Project Manager thought that a rechargeable battery or solar cell is necessary, and the setting of the positioner and the reduction of button number is feasible. Project Manager wanted the remote control to be used only for TV, which can save the budget. For voice recognition, he thought it was unaffordable for young people, so the design was abandoned.",

In addition, some small protuberances can be designed under the remote control, which is more convenient for users from the perspective of ergonomics, and the battery can be installed from the engineering point of view. He also proposed a two in one remote control. The small remote control has simple basic functions and is easy to carry.

I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert . She's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants . Um {vocalsound} Ryan is our User Interface Designer . And Manuel is the Industrial Designer .

Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say . And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . And if anyone could clarify what that means ?"

Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button .

From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at {disfmarker} the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think {disfmarker} and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . And so in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose .

I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . To look at similar devices . Um defined in some them . And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . Um we discussed a universal one . Um like it's just been brought up again then . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to {disfmarker} i they're a nightmare to use . You have to set them , reset them to everything . Um and that would only add buttons . Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . Um {disfmarker} Okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls . They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . But one is uh user-centred . That is the one on the left . And you can straight away see there's less buttons . And the other one is {gap} engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um {disfmarker} {gap} which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the {gap} have said and the market research and stuff {gap} probably looking at something that should be user-centred . Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away {disfmarker} if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under {disfmarker} some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . Um and finally , um uh sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated . Um {disfmarker} Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . Um and as what it , the major findings {gap} market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . And that's it ."

Um which is usually a battery right ? {vocalsound} Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself {vocalsound} . Uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . Right ? This is the user interface and there we have the chip . Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . That sends out the signal . Of course the signal differs accordingly . Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . And {disfmarker} Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . You press something , you get a response . Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . Right ? These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . It c it doesn't have to be there . This can be discussed as well . {vocalsound} The user interface . That's something we can also discuss . Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . Speech recognition um interface , we don't know that . Or if we just do the usual button thing . Or we have a touch pad or something like that {disfmarker} that's something we can discuss . And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells .
