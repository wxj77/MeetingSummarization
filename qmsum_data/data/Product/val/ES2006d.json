Firstly, User Interface presented on the prototype, including the shape, the size of the remote and the user interface including the buttons and the scrolling wheel. Next, the group had an evaluation criterion on the prototype. They scored an overall six point five average on the prototype and thought they had done well on it. Then, the group had a discussion about project finance. The group decided not to have a sample sensor and the locator because they had a production cost of 12.5 Euros. Lastly, the group had a discussion about the project process, including the use of a pen, the whiteboard and the PowerPoint. Also, the group was satisfied with Project Manager's leadership and Project Manager also mentioned that their costs were within the budget as well as some admin work."
