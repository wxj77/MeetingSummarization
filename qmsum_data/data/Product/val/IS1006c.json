The industrial designer preferred traditional batteries, titanium and simple push buttons so that they would have enough money for speech recognition. After that, the group talked about LCD display and locating methods. The second topic was user interface concept, which was basically a good-looking design with few buttons. The group decided to change the colour of the assembly at an extra charge to meet special needs. To make a smart controller, they mentioned speech recognition and user identification. When it came to trend watching, the marketing put forward three noteworthy aspects - being fancy, technologically innovative and useful. The group agreed to follow the trend but the specific design was not decided."

The second point was that as a remote control it had to be technologically innovative. Thirdly, being easy to use was also necessary. From a broader perspective, fruit and vegetables were in fashion this year and being spongy was also popular. Thus, contrary to the industrial designer, the marketing thought rubber was more feasible in terms of sponginess. The group agreed that the product should resemble fruit and vegetable in shape and colour but the specific design was not decided.",

Take this year's fruit and vegetable as an example, it applies to everything from clothing to furniture, which meant it was quite general.

We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh {vocalsound} example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also {disfmarker} have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend .
