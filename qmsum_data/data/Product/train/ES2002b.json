For the previous remote, User Interface found it was clunky but the functions were basic, or the remote was too complicated with lots of buttons. Based on this, User Interface demonstrated two kinds of buttons access to advanced functions. Next, Marketing presented on market trends and proposed three inspirations including the fancy look and technology innovation based on the customer needs. Then, Industrial Designer presented on the working design and introduced the working design logic of the battery and power source. Lastly, the group discussed the remote functions. They decided to have fifteen to thirty-five-year-old target groups as well as to have video controls map to advanced functionality so that they could skip the basic channel button."

They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . Um , takes time to learn how to use them . This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . Um and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for ."
