After that, each person drew their favourite animals on the whiteboard and shared their reasons for the choice, with Project Manager choosing an elk, Industrial Designer a cat, User Interface a dog, and Marketing a butterfly. Project Manager then added some financial details to their plan, setting their selling price and cost. In the following brainstorming time, they raised ideas on night-time operation, a tracking device, and the design for buttons and shape.

Another function could be to track the remote when it goes lost, probably realized through some kind of alarm on the remote and a button installed somewhere else. One last proposed function was to design a hidden panel for the remote, containing all the less used buttons so that they wouldn't take up too much space on the main panel and confuse the user.",

Industrial checked whether they were going into novelty factors because the remote still had to be universally acceptable if they wanted it to sell. Yet it couldn't be too boring, so it would be key for the team to figure out a way for the remote to be trendy and original, but at the same time not too outrageous.",
