After Project Manager reviewed the last meeting briefly, Marketing made a presentation about re-envisioning the menu functionality, current technology, and interaction with other tools of the remote control by discarding unnecessary buttons and adding the speech recognition to the remote control according to market research. User Interface argued that they should discard the existing standard, and only keep the basic and user-friendly functions like channel selection, volume and enter key. The group then discussed the source of power whether to have a charger or solar power. Although solar energy was fancy and environmentally friendly, the cost was much higher than using a charger. The group faced some difficulty when deciding the target group whether for the young end or for the lower end of the age range who have more money than sense. In the next part, the group reached a consensus in terms of the keys of the remote control, which is power, channel, volume, enter, number."

Therefore, to ensure the low price of the remote control, they had to think it over when deciding whether to use speech recognition.

Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's {disfmarker} I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have .

I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese .

            "content": "Alright . Thank you very much . Um . One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar {disfmarker} of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players {disfmarker} although it makes immediate sense to {vocalsound} have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh {disfmarker} will only benefit from the positive feedback {vocalsound} from our well designed tool . So again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . Um {vocalsound} fifty percent {disfmarker} I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this {vocalsound} there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy ."

But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . {vocalsound} And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and {disfmarker} which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the {disfmarker} which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . Now I would have hoped {disfmarker} I think that's my only slide actually , yeah . I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . {vocalsound} So we want an energy source which is there .
