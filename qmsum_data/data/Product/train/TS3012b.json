And then Project Manager delivered new requirements for the look, functions, and some others about the remote control. Later on the team brainstormed about many functional designs\u2014where to put buttons and how much size they should be, the necessity of beep and flash, the design of covers, and the choice of LCD screen and rechargeable batteries\u2014of the remote control based on new requirements, researches, current technology and production price. Finally they decided about the remote's button design and had an optimistic attitude towards rechargeable things but there still needed more market research when they gave a sketch of the new product."

            "answer": "Marketing gave a presentation in the first place based on research and came up with ideas like what their remote control should look like, buttons design, whether the new product should have LCD screens. Marketing also suggested that there could be any chances that remote control could know users' preference channels, and there would be a beep when they couldn't find control. Then User Interface delivered a speech mainly on the size of buttons and remote control, and agreed to find remote control easier and increase its durability. At last, Industrial Designer did an analysis on what Marketing and User Interface said before and claimed that there still needed a lot to know but integration of materials meant less cost for the production and they should make up a different Morse code when some button was pressed.",

And another thing Marketing found important was that users had a feeling for speech recognition so that they could choose channels by voice. And they wanted maybe an LCD screen to search what's on every channel.",

            "answer": "First Industrial Designer raised questions like whether their remote control would be universal and should it be programmable or not, because they needed something like a mode to send out a different signal so that the remote can work in this way. Then the size of the remote was also put by Industrial Designer since there were already plenty of technical parts in it and it was quite complex to deal with material problems. But at last Industrial Designer came up with the idea of integration of materials and in this way, the new product would cost less.",
