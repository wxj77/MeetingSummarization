After the discussion, the Marketing offered a questionnaire for the group to check if they were on the right track. Through the questionnaire, they found that it would be better if they paid more attention to the external design so the Industrial Design embellished the current design on the color and logo.

The first idea they came up with was to reduce the number of the buttons. The Industrial Design proposed to use an integrating button to replace the scattered ones, but inevitably, this also had some defects. The User Interface focused on the material and he put forward to choose a cheaper material like wood or plastics. Paying attention to the energy consumption, the Marketing suggested using a hand dynamo to save the cost of batteries.",

It did sound great for that it allowed users to function the remote control by manipulating only one button as well as saved the cost for the group. However, according to the User Interface, actually it could cost even five times to design and produce an integrating button than just produce several scattered buttons, so this might not be a feasible suggestion.",

In addition, in order to keep it innovative, the group decided to add some unique things like fruit logos or make it in a three-D shape. According to the User Interface, they should put the electronics into fashions so the material also needed some discussion.
