            "answer": "Firstly, User Interface and Industrial Designer introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its form, material and the colour. The prototype was a pretty simple design with an obvious company logo on it and two buttons in the middle. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of the advantages of its main features discussed before and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet the original requirements and goals. Lastly, the team calculated the cost of the prototype and found that it was not easy to land on the exact budget. After trying to incorporate as many functions as the team could for a while, the team decided to use regular chips, normal batteries and a combination of cheap materials and fancy ones, which made the budget under control."

            "answer": "The prototype was a pretty simple design with an obvious company logo on it and two buttons in the middle. There were also power buttons and nine others for switching channels with the incorporation of the menu and teletext. In the middle there was a part of hard material, a bit of hard plastic with a light behind it. In terms of materials and color, the team designed one colour for the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber buttons. Also, the team agreed that the company logo, together with the standard color could be the company's identity. Last but not least, the current device did not include the docking station but the Marketing expressed his interest towards it and the team decided to reconsider it in the following parts of the meeting.",

            "answer": "The team agreed that the prototype had a moderate appearance and it really depended on the individual taste of each customer. Some might find the device really fancy. However, the function that enabled the user to design for its own front look stood out since this could add value to users' favour towards personalities. The team also came to an agreement that the remote control's relevant buttons were prominently visible and relevant to each other, making the device easy to use. There was also a speaker incorporated into the device, solving the problem that sometimes it was out of sight. Meanwhile, the innovation of this device which was without a LCD display or any other technology required functions was not that satisfactory.",

            "answer": "Firstly, the team agreed that only one battery is enough and using kinetic was not a must since it would be too expensive and useless. Secondly, one chip was enough and they were going to choose one from different types of regular chips. However, as the team found out they could incorporate more valuable components, the team decided to use one advanced chip for now. In terms of the material used on the device, the team decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic with one small part used in one special materia, like titanium, as well as a special color. Moreover, the teletext was discarded and the docking station was added. As for the infrared LED, although it was originally presented on Marketing's powerpoint, the team agreed that it was not helpful. Later, the team found that regular chips were enough for the scroll-button and only the LCD display required the advanced ones, so again the team came back for the regular chip and cut some costs. In the end, the team incorporated solar cells for the battery.",
