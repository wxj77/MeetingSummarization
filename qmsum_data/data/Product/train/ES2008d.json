Firstly, the group presented the prototype with agreed features including a latex case in fruity colours that's curved, push buttons with an on-screen menu button as well as eight extra buttons. Next, the group had a discussion about the prototype evaluation. They gave a high scale of the score on creativity, ease of use, integration of fruits as well as the simplicity. Also, they gave an average score on technology innovation and ease of learning. Then, the group agreed to set the target price at 12.5 Euros. Lastly, the group had a discussion about the project process, including management and leadership as well as group mates' personal learning."

We'll look at the finances and finally a {disfmarker} do a production evaluation and close . So , starting off with the um last {disfmarker} the last one , oh I don't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um , we're gonna need a scroll um , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . Okay ? Let's do the look and feel design presentation first ."

Um it's {disfmarker} you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even {disfmarker} I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . If you push {disfmarker} if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if {disfmarker} uh the volume buttons rather . If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here .
