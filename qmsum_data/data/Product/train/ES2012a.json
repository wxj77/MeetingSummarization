The team members got acquainted with each other and Project Manager introduced the financial target. Each product would be priced at 25 Euros and a 50% profit is made, aiming at making an overall profit of 50 million Euros. In terms of style and design, the remote control should be stylish to stay competitive. Also, it should be made dependable and of medium size and the user interface can be made into face-plates. The material should be plastic as it is the lightest. To market the remote control, the project team can launch parallel marketing schemes to fit both customers who value the remote control's appearance and those who value its practicability. To market interchangeable fronts, the team can either get control in a set of colours or with face-plates."
