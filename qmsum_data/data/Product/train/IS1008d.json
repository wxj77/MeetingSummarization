Industrial Designer and User Interface each gave a presentation on the prototype and discussed the evaluation criteria, especially that of microphone and buttons. Next, the group did calculations on the budget as well as the profit goal before Marketing showed the challenges of this project in terms of budget control and reaching the profit target. The group then discussed using the internet for promotion and ordering and drop-shipping the product to the customer's residence. Finally, the subject moved to product evaluation by putting the prototype on the market and analyzing the feedback. The group discussed whether they should spare time for the redesign process before releasing the product to the market. Then Industrial Designer put up a strategy to do effective user research by choosing sports seasons."

Alright , so from {disfmarker} when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . {vocalsound} Um , so {vocalsound} to unveil our lovely product . This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see ."

The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . So up {disfmarker} volume up , down {disfmarker} volume down . The green are the channel changing . {vocalsound} S And it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition .
