The prototype was a pretty simple design in a mango shape with the company logo on it and innovative functions like the plus button. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of both the conceptual as well as functional meetings and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet the original requirements and goals. Thirdly, the team calculated the cost of the prototype and found that the most expensive part was the use of kinetic. But the team decided to use regular chips and cheap materials, which made the budget under control. Lastly, the team gave positive feedback on the project and the process."

The color of the prototype was vanilla and yellow like and the material was a combination of rubber and plastic with a company logo. Moreover, there was a circular design for the numbers so it could be palm-held, accessible from the user' thumb. Besides, a plus button was added on the device so the channels could be switched easily without any confusion.For instance, one plus two it could go to channel twelve. But this function was challenged by Industrial Designer who argued that it was not snappy since the five-second pause input time was enough for switching to the double-digit channel. After all, the team agreed that it was overall, a good design, well representing the company's identity.",

            "answer": "The team agreed that the prototype had a fancy look-and-feels once they did not choose the traditional ugly black and grey color but incorporated the company's color. Although, there were only push buttons and no LED display, the incorporation of the kinetic energy, making the device more durable and rubber material made it technologically innovative. Moreover, the team thought the device was easy to use and good looking but Project Manager suggested that the company logo could be smaller. Besides, the device's simplistic made it stand out and customers were willing to pay a little more for that and its good appearance. Last but not least, the device could match the operating behavior of the average user and the alarming function, a light would vibrate, added value to the device.",

Secondly, in terms of the material used on the device, the team decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic to cut costs with one color for the case and one color for the buttons. Moreover, the push button interface was inexpensive so the team agreed to add a special form for the case.
