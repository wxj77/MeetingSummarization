Project manager said that the remote control would be sold at 25 Euros and a production cost of 12.5 Euros. Project Manager also hoped to achieve fifty million Euros and international market by new remote control. Then the team discussed the disadvantages of the remote control and designed a new remote control style. Industrial Designer made a desire to design a remote control that can be used in different devices with most used buttons. Project Manager agreed that rather than complicated buttons, friendly to users and minimalist design with necessary buttons would be better."

Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods . It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far . Okay . But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . I already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of uh much use to us . Uh we will have to take advantage of these two things . They are smart boards . As you can see , you can give a presentation on them . And uh this one here is a white board . I will uh instruct you about that soon . Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , um uh to go back and forward between pages , and of course uh to save it every now and then . Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance like this if everything's okay ,"
