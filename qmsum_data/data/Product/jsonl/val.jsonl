Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and {vocalsound} uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . {vocalsound} Okay , so {vocalsound} these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um {vocalsound} so basically uh the {disfmarker} as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um {vocalsound} and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um {vocalsound} okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the {vocalsound} the use for television , {vocalsound} in order to keep things simple . Um {vocalsound} also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . {vocalsound} Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um {vocalsound} there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so {vocalsound} I'll basic go over to the {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates {disfmarker} uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . {vocalsound} So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then {disfmarker} so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated {vocalsound} to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Um so {vocalsound} i in my personal preferences um {vocalsound} I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um {vocalsound} uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . {vocalsound} That's about it . {vocalsound} So anything that you would like to know or {vocalsound} {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Thanks ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} Br"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah .

No ? No ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Should {disfmarker} yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Oh okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay , that's fine , that's good . Okay , let's start from the beginning . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some {vocalsound} some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um {vocalsound} all the project but it's just at th at this very moment ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um uh my method was um to look at um other {vocalsound} um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . {vocalsound} And yeah , and then just to um {vocalsound} put the main function of the remote control in in words ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um so the findings uh were {vocalsound} um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm {vocalsound} uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I als"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , {vocalsound} okay , that's great ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "'Kay . Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm {vocalsound} functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then {vocalsound} there are {disfmarker} surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . Um then {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then {vocalsound} the channel numbers and then um {vocalsound} the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um {vocalsound} could be just {disfmarker} uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um {vocalsound} done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So at the {disfmarker} for the time being that's uh that's all ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "If you have questions {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "If {disfmarker} I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for {disfmarker} that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , and also it's it's um {disfmarker} other question is uh because there are so many different {disfmarker} And there are so many different things that could possibly be included"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{gap}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . Um but um {vocalsound} so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or {disfmarker} I mean in {disfmarker} we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I mean um what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , and it'll make the costs {disfmarker} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and uh with um {disfmarker} because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . So yeah ? Cool ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm . Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Cool . Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Do you want to {disfmarker} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh am I going in the right direction ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wait ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh , I'm getting hungry . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay , here it comes .

Ah , that's why it won't meet . {vocalsound} Okay , cool ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "You set ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yep , cool . Okay , functional requirements ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Alright , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Hello ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{gap} try to press {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Is it plugged in prop"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "oh , okay ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It's working ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "it's working ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yep ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Cool , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Excellent ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control .

What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . {vocalsound} Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide .

There's {disfmarker} but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh {vocalsound} um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . {vocalsound} Anyway .

For your first PowerPoint it's lovely ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} 'Kay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction .

So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort {disfmarker} like watching a hundred people {vocalsound} use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . {vocalsound} And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their {disfmarker} the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . {vocalsound} Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . {vocalsound} So it's a good start for us ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} That's great . Thank you Sarah . Right .

With a touch screen for the basic functions . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally {disfmarker} let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen .

So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um um the method I {vocalsound} employed this time was {vocalsound} a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and {vocalsound} also um {vocalsound} whether their appearance was was pleasant . Um {vocalsound} and then um {vocalsound} this uh this um {vocalsound} this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So some findings um {vocalsound} um . So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . Um {vocalsound} okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . Okay , some of them are here ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um {vocalsound} well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh , {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "sorry for that . 'S go back ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} That's nice one ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Ah , no , please . Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually {vocalsound} of the {disfmarker} of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least {disfmarker} uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Ugly ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Um okay . So let's carry on with this . Um {disfmarker} So uh um o other findings {disfmarker} um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . {vocalsound} Our own company has developed a new in user interface {disfmarker} uh wait , no this is not the one . Okay , there is a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows {disfmarker} i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It's {disfmarker} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed {vocalsound} a new um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh programmable speech uh {vocalsound} mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's {disfmarker} it should be ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's {disfmarker} once once the mm {vocalsound} um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh-huh , hi {vocalsound} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So {vocalsound} I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? Um {vocalsound} uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Uh {vocalsound} oh yeah are th"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It's like the {disfmarker} like you said , no ? The scroll scroll wheel ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , you can't {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} just a moment , I'll {vocalsound} I'll show you . I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like um {vocalsound} it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Look , this one here ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh , it's like the iPod ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "G yeah , no , you can ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "it's like you press this or this or {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It's like it's like where you {disfmarker} you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} Uh-huh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Alright , right . Okay , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "and it {disfmarker} yeah . It is {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So instead of going down you just spin {disfmarker} yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "You just go round"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "and it is a bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh-huh ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh-huh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "but you've got a lot less control over it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right .

Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . Um and I I also thought uh {vocalsound} if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . There is {vocalsound} uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So yeah , that's uh that's it ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Excellent .

Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Fabulous . Okay , cool . Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay . Right . Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right .

Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "so that means we need an advanced thing ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I dunno if it is the right point to take it up .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "so if you're watching something {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "That's true , yeah , that's also {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And i it would be like {disfmarker} I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm right ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And then you can flip it open ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , I think so ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "You you agree ?

We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .

Firstly, the Industrial Designer introduced the prototype of the product. It had not only the round basic shape which was made of hard plastics and titanium using different colors, but also the buttons like channel and volumn. Later, the group discussed some details and changes of redesigning the logo, buttons and screens. Next, the Marketing Expert mentioned the exterior of the product, the material attraction, and how easy it was to learn or use the basic functions of the product. Besides, the group discussed some details of the cost of components and made the product cheaper by replacing the titanium by hard plastics with similar color.

Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh {disfmarker} and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh {disfmarker} We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . {vocalsound} Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ?

Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I {vocalsound} I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the {gap} we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say {gap} . I will {disfmarker} that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change {vocalsound} I think ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two {disfmarker} several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh {disfmarker} also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Um well th uh that's my second point ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um {disfmarker} You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that .

So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target {vocalsound} audience or our target product users , customers .

Um {disfmarker} They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control . {vocalsound} Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy .

Um {vocalsound} We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start {disfmarker} talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I {gap} guess you know game or something um {vocalsound} in real life um so yeah basically I want to {disfmarker} I'm just gonna {disfmarker} you got {disfmarker} of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um {vocalsound} uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . {vocalsound} Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um {vocalsound} y is"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} You're just gonna believe me ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "we'll go from there ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Exactly .

Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . {vocalsound} Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics .

And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um {vocalsound} I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me {vocalsound} tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up . So that's the detailed design . So it's a three stage kind of thing . Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down {disfmarker} I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you {disfmarker} if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um .

And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you {disfmarker} it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice {gap} have it curved . And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh {gap} it won't have to burst uh like in the {disfmarker} in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb . And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "uh if you {gap} push uh channel one , you can see channel one . The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper .

And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the {disfmarker} for remote control , that we then use the primary colours .

What are your experiences ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And that it controls the channels and the the volume . And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it {disfmarker} in it .

No uh yes . Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on {vocalsound} how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people {gap} have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh {vocalsound} example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also {disfmarker} have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that .

The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{gap}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh {vocalsound} it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Next slide please ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that .

Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using .

Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} Listening more ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so we can have more functions for T_V_"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Well I could could uh have a look at that {vocalsound} maybe ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Although I don't know . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Alright ? Thanks for your attention ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now {vocalsound} the technical aspects of this new device . Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Two . Yeah , if {disfmarker} {gap} Sorry ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "You prefer it {gap} . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh {disfmarker} like digital calculators and electronic calculators . {vocalsound} So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what {disfmarker} to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . {vocalsound} And usually this {disfmarker} so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages {disfmarker} these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device {gap} remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are {disfmarker} I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you {disfmarker} can you make it on the whiteboard , or {disfmarker} mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface {gap} speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "On {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yeah , so that we just use simple recog"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Too complex ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "no but but {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But uh very very good to sell . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . No , even in {disfmarker} you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "and ha ha you cannot use my remote control ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "because it's targeted to me . Whatever . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And what about the price of this component ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So {disfmarker} Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It mm {disfmarker} okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Hmm . Cheap ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "because we want to have uh millions and in bulk ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Millions . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so we can make really simp"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and we want to make really simple device"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Cheap ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "or or it will be something like volume , up , down ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt {gap} volume and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "With a keywords and {disfmarker} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and and because we can't really say user to say same wording"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Couple of words ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "then it become more mechanical and {disfmarker} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Of course uh it has to be {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "it's it it will be take care of our main {disfmarker} mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this {disfmarker} the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} But then I think you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "and and he's coming {disfmarker} you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No , in no not only speech , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It's on top of using the button ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} I it's an option ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Well , I dunno . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this {gap} processor and {disfmarker} This really {gap} , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and {gap} like this key ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay. ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "T_V_ ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm , mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so {disfmarker} and we have only few things here {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Sho to to train , okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Like , if I want to put volume up I like do {disfmarker} mm I take my remote control do like {disfmarker} something like"},

{"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "or roll 'em down ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} Very expensive ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "because it's it's very expensive"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "no ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm why ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "That's just {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And volume control ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it {disfmarker} different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So but uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote
