They presented remote control features including the circuit board, the chip, the kinetic energy, the interface mechanism of operation, the scroll wheel to be added as well as the LCD and spinning innovation. Then, the group had a discussion about the key remote concepts. They decided to have a LCD display with a spinning wheel. They would not have hand dynamos, instead, they would have a wind dynamo. And they would keep the kinetic energy as an option and look at more spongy material preferences with rubber or plastic."

Next, User Interface presented on user interface including the mechanisms to operate and input data, the shape and the size, the buttons and the voice recognition as well as the scroll wheel. Then, Marketing presented on market trends. In consideration of the target age group and technology innovation, Marketing suggested the group could go for LCD, the colours and the voice recognition as well as the flat spongy material based on current trends.",

Also, Marketing thought the group could have a minimalist remote control so that users could flip it open if they wanted to mess about it.",

Project Manager thought given that they were looking at more spongy material preferences, rubber or plastic would be more practical.

And Industrial Designer thought it seemed to be out of trend, while Marketing thought they had to have push-buttons. Industrial Designer supplemented that if they had LCD displays, users could select everything on the LCD. However, User Interface thought the LCD was just for fast scrolling. So User Interface suggested using it as normal control. Marketing mentioned that they wanted buttons for users and everything else menu-driven.",
