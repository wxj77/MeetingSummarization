The group spent a lot of time discussing the components of the device, especially the scroll wheel and power source. The main topics in the discussion about functional design were speech recognition and the function of rolling through the user's favourite channels. The former was abandoned while the latter was adopted by the group for its novelty and feasibility. After discussing the functions, the group thought they were approaching the high-end market, so they could push up the price. In spite of that, the project manager supposed the profit expectation might not be so important as opening up a new market and promoting their brand. In the end, they agreed to price the product at thirty-five to fifty Euros."

Also, wood was not suitable as it seemed anti-technology. Thus, the user interface designer recommended making a thick plastic inner shell and a rubber outer shell which was more durable and felt better.",

Plus, many people today were television surfers, and the scroll was a great mechanism for surfing. But there were two problems with the scroll wheel. On one hand, it broke down easily and would bring down the robustness of the whole product. On the other hand, users had to scroll really slowly to keep in pace with the TV's ability to change channels, which would be frustrating.",

The project manager liked this idea and the marketing thought it would be another great market tool. In terms of the cost, the project manager believed it wouldn't be too expensive because they could come up with a partnership to produce that quite cheaply, but the marketing held that the technology was available through their own service.
