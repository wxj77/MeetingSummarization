Then, Industrial Designer shared the working design and main components of the remote. Also, they discussed functions that they would add to the remote such as a child lock and the appearance of the remote, such as having a comfortable shape and different colours. User Interface then raised some features that the remote ought to have such as having a timer. Finally, Project Manager stated their target group, which was people aged ten to forty, and they discussed how to cater to their needs, such as having large buttons for the elderly."

The signal released from the remote through radio waves or infrared can change different functionalities in the television. There should be a timer to set for viewing a particular program or for switching on or off a particular program or lock the television to save electricity according to the user's choice. A child lock system should be added.",

Also, the buttons can glow differently according to different functions. The remote will beep if too many buttons are pressed at once.

It would be for everybody who has a TV, mainly aged ten to forty. In the subgroups of the target group, there are elderly people who have limited functions with their fingers and hands and nervous people who cannot press a little button unless it is very clear. To make the remote sellable, it should be intuitive and easy to use in order to shorten the learning curve. It could be sold with a slogan.",

There will be buttons and underneath them are switches and bulbs. To hold everything in, there should be a case and a remote holder. The material used for the remote should be human friendly so that it will not cause any skin disease or allergy to either children or adults.

'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the {disfmarker} a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep , and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . 'Kay can we go to the next slide please ? Okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . That is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . Uh because once there's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back ."

You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing . And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good . Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros . So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that . Has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five Euros isn't much .
