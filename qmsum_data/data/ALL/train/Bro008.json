Somewhere in there , depending on the {pause} exact case . So So that 's good .

Um , if , uh {disfmarker} Cuz there 's things that they are doing {pause} there that we certainly are not doing . And there 's things that we 're doing that {pause} they 're not doing .

And then on the terminal 's side , I don't know how much , um , memory and {disfmarker} and CPU it takes , but it seems like the filtering {pause} Uh , I mean , the VAD stuff they both had , right ?

And , um , then it would {disfmarker} it would , uh {pause} be something to {disfmarker} to discuss in the meeting . But , uh , not clear what will go on . Um , I mean , on the one hand , um , sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there . I mean , you can always have another standard after that , but {vocalsound} this process has gone on for a while on {disfmarker} already and {disfmarker} and people might just wanna pick something and say , \" OK , this is it . \" And then , that 's a standard . Uh , standards are always optional . It 's just that , uh , if you disobey them , then you risk not being able to sell your product , or {pause} {vocalsound} Uh {pause} um And people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on .
