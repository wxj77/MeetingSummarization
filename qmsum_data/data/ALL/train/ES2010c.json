Marketing pointed out that customers wanted the remote to be technologically innovative and yet simple to use, and that the current fashion trend was fruits and vegetable patterns. Clearly labelled large buttons with the company logo and colour scheme were also preferred. User Interface followed with the presentation on interface concepts, proposing to have a scroll-down design and a distinctly recognizable demographic for specific buttons. Industrial Designer's presentation on component design provided information for the material needed for the remote, and certain restrictions coming with different options. After User Interface's additional thoughts on voice recognition, the team discussed designs of the energy source, the material, and the user interface concept, deciding on latex covers, the gun-metal grey colour, and blue and yellow touch buttons."

The team then decided on a single smaller remote instead of a bigger one with a base, and a locating device would sufficiently prevent the remote from being lost. In terms of the battery, Industrial Designer suggested one small lithium battery instead of double A's or triple A's. An initial lithium battery could be sold with the remote, while subsequent replacements would be bought separately. With this suggestion in mind, the team decided to come back to it in the next meeting.",

The team agreed on this, and Project Manager reminded them the remote was not going to be a huge one.

Project Manager had concerns on it being more expensive, but Industrial Designer said the final cost could be levelled down by its longer battery life. The bulk price for lithium batteries would also be fairly cheap. As for how to realize this design in the sales, Industrial Designer suggested providing one initial lithium battery along with the remote, while replacements would be sold separately.",

Despite Industrial Designer's proposal for scrolls, the team decided on buttons on the side instead. For their logo, Project Manager suggested putting it on a major button, but User Interface objected that it would wear off. They finally decided on leaving a space on the latex cover for the logo to be always visible. As for the colour for buttons, their decision was blue-based touch buttons with a yellow illumination.",

            "answer": "Project Manager suggested having a large version of the company's logo in the middle of the remote. User Interface pointed out that this design would make the remote too big and wide to fit into one hand. Furthermore, a large logo would take up so much space that the buttons would have to be smaller, and thus they would be less discernible. Project Manager acknowledged that User Interface's argument was reasonable. User Interface then proposed an alternative design, curving the remote like a hand with scroll buttons on the side.",

Yet User Interface opposed this idea for fear that the print would wear off. Industrial Designer suggested putting the logo on the back of the remote, but this option was ruled out since the logo must be always visible. User Interface presented another option where the remote would consist of two pieces, but this too was incompatible with the cover design. Finally, Industrial Designer suggested leaving a cut-out space on latex covers to show the logo, and all agreed on this design.",

Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . So that being said {disfmarker} Next slide , please . Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . Next slide , please . Thank you . Uh personal preferences , uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . {vocalsound} Next slide , please .
