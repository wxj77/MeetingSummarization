The professor suggested the solution might just be feeding the log magnitude of the spectrum into a simple neural net.

Then, Grad A introduced the team to phonological matchings that he was working on using Support Vector Machines. The goal was to map MFCC's to phonological features. The team concluded by discussing a potential bug which led to a significant difference between PLP and mel cepstrum and the FFT method that they were exploring."

Uh , completeness in the {disfmarker} in the sense that {vocalsound} um if we {disfmarker} if we pick these X number of acoustic events , {vocalsound} do they provide sufficient coverage {vocalsound} for the phones that we 're trying to recognize {vocalsound} or {disfmarker} or the f the words that we 're gonna try to recognize later on .
