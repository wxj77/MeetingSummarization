First of all, the prototype was presented, which was pretty much like what the group had agreed before, including the yellow colour, cover and buttons made by rubber, etc. However, what they had exceeded their expected budget. Therefore, they had discussions on which features were okay to be taken out. They finally agreed on removing speech recognition, and the special colour. Then they did an evaluation of their product, and overall they did well. To sum up this teamwork experience, the Project Manager emphasized the importance of the communications. At last, they had a discussion on the product name, and agreed on \"triple R\"."

As for the special colour, they had some disagreements initially, since User Interface thought it could not reflect the current trend anymore if it was taken out. However, after evaluating dropping other features such as rubber or curve, they agreed that both of them brought more advantages than the special colour. Besides, the colour could be made up by using special covers.",

Other design {disfmarker} anyway , we took as {disfmarker} we took w we took rubber as as the material last time . We also {gap} that you're just busy with it . Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features . Well , we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the {gap} other screen , which is fine . Um {gap} we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black . Yellow in the back because it's m trendy , more trendy than black anyway . So {vocalsound} then we ca yeah .
