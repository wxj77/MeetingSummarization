The meeting covered the pipeline they would use to create their data set. The team started by discussing the technical issues with their own recording equipment and then moved onto a general overview of the entire pipeline. Then, the team narrowed down on how they could carry out transcriptions. Various ideas were thrown around, but the team did not seem convinced that a software could do the task. They would need human annotators due to the granularity they were aiming for. Then, the team talked abut transcription conventions; what should be annotated and how? The team also talked about the interface they could use for transcriptions. Finally, the team ended with a discussion on the time it takes to annotate and the electronics involved."
