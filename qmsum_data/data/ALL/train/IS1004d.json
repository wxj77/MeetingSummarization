User Interface and Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the prototype with a banana leaf base station and a hand-sized remote with two scroll wheels, the turbo button, the teletext button, the calling button, the rechargeable-batteries power source, and the speaker regular chip. Next, the group evaluated based on Marketing's list of user requirement criteria. Then, groupmates discussed the cost estimation, including the component production cost. They agreed to use plastic instead of rubber material for the dual chips. Also, they agreed not to use LCD and no button supplements to avoid over budget. Lastly, the group discussed the project process. The group agreed they had creativity, while User Interface suggested that they should find out more target markets. Besides, Project Manager suggested doing a street survey. Also, User Interface suggested that they could simplify the interface and the circuit board."
