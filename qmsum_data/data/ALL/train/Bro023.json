The team then discussed integrating mean log magnitude spectral subtraction into the SmartKom system. It seemed, however, that lengthening the time for this task was not very effective. The team also learned more about Wiener filtering which worked well when mixed with other approaches. It was almost as effective as the best systems. The team then delved into spectral subtraction and discussed the various ways in which it could be refined. The meeting ended with comments on the additional latency that was caused by this method."

So say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time , but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ? And , um {disfmarker} So I w bef before , um {disfmarker} Back in May , I did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , um , here , I was curious , what if I trained the models using twelve seconds but I f I gave it a situation where the test set I was {disfmarker} subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , um {disfmarker} So I did that for about three different conditions . And , um {disfmarker} I mean , I th I think it was , um , four se I think {disfmarker} I think it was , um , something like four seconds and , um , six seconds , and eight seconds . Something like that . And it seems like it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it hurts compared to if you actually train the models {comment} using th that same length of time but it {disfmarker} it doesn't hurt that much . Um , u usually less than point five percent , although I think I did see one where it was a point eight percent or so rise in word error rate . But this is , um , w where , um , even if I train on the , uh , model , and mean subtracted it with the same length of time as in the test , it {disfmarker} the word error rate is around , um , ten percent or nine percent .

Actually , when you do spectral subtraction you can , uh , find this {disfmarker} this equivalent in the s in the spectral domain . You can uh compute , y you can say that d your spectral subtraction is a filter , um , and the gain of this filter is the , um , {vocalsound} signal energy minus what you subtract , divided by the signal energy . And this is a gain that varies over time , and , you know , of course , uh , depending on the s on the noise spectrum and on the speech spectrum . And {disfmarker} what happen actually is that during low SNR values , the gain is close to zero but it varies a lot .

So in this way , you can also reduce {disfmarker} somewhat reduce the musical noise and you reduce the variability if you have different noise shapes , because the {disfmarker} the spectrum becomes more flat in the silence portions . Um . Yeah . With this , no improvement , uh , but there are a lot of parameters that we can play with and , um {disfmarker} Actually , this {disfmarker} this could be seen as a soft version of the frame dropping because , um , you could just put the threshold and say that \" below the threshold , I will flatten {disfmarker} comp completely flatten the {disfmarker} the spectrum \" . And above this threshold , uh , keep the same spectrum . So it would be like frame dropping , because during the silence portions which are below the threshold of voice activity probability , {comment} uh , w you would have some kind of dummy frame which is a perfectly flat spectrum . And this , uh , whitening is something that 's more soft because , um , you whiten {disfmarker} you just , uh , have a function {disfmarker} the whitening is a function of the speech probability , so it 's not a hard decision ."
