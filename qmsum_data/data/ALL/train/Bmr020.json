The results presented in the former show a significant percentage of overlapping speech even without counting in backchanneling. Regarding the transcriptions to be carried out by IBM, the discussion mainly concerned the format of the recordings that should be sent to them. Suggestions included sending only the channels with the dominant speakers for transcription, but it was finally agreed on sending the original files with minimal modifications, as there will be extensive in-house post-processing."

So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} whether there was a pause essentially here , because spurts are a {disfmarker} defined as being you know , five hundred milliseconds or longer pauses , and then we had things like discourse markers , uh , backchannels , uh , disfluencies . um , uh , filled pauses {disfmarker} So disfluen the D 's are for , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} the interruption points of a disfluency , so , where you hesitate , or where you start the repair there . Uh , what else do we had . Uh , repeated {disfmarker} you know , repeated words is another of that kind of disfluencies and so forth . So we had both the beginnings and ends of these {disfmarker} uh so , the end of a filled pause and the end of a discourse marker . And we just eyeballed {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} we didn't really hand - tag all of these things . We just {pause} looked at the distribution of words , and so every {vocalsound} \" so yeah \" , and \" OK \" , uh , and \" uh - huh \" were {disfmarker} were the {disfmarker} were deemed to be backchannels and {vocalsound} \" wow \" and \" so \" and {vocalsound} uh \" right \" , uh were um {disfmarker} {pause} Not \" right \" . \" Right \" is a backchannel . But so , we sort of {disfmarker} just based on the lexical {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um , identity of the words , we {disfmarker} we tagged them as one of these things . And of course the d the interruption points we got from the original transcripts . So , and then we looked at the disti so we looked at the {pause} distribution of these different kinds of tags , overall uh , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and particularly at the interruption points . And uh , we found that there is a marked difference so that for instance after {disfmarker} so at the end after a discourse marker or after backchannel or after filled pause , you 're much more likely to be interrupted {vocalsound} than before . OK ? And also of course after spurt ends , which means basically in p inside pauses .

Um , the tr so the idea initially was , we would get {vocalsound} uh , for the new meetings , so the e EDU meetings , that {vocalsound} Thilo ha has now presegmented all of them for us , on a channel by channel basis . And um , so , I 've assigned {disfmarker} I 've {disfmarker} I 've assigned them to our transcribers and um , so far I 've discussed it with one , with uh {disfmarker} And I had a {pause} about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday , we went through {vocalsound} uh EDU - one , at some extent . And it occurred to me that {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} that {vocalsound} basically what we have in this kind of a format is {disfmarker} you could consider it as a staggered mixed file , we had some discussion over the weekend a about {disfmarker} at {disfmarker} at this other meeting that we were all a at {disfmarker} um , {vocalsound} about whether the tran the IBM transcribers should hear a single channel audio , or a mixed channel audio . And um , {vocalsound} in {disfmarker} in a way , by {disfmarker} by having this {disfmarker} this chunk and then the backchannel {vocalsound} after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel . And um , {vocalsound} it occurred {pause} to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um , um , the {disfmarker} {pause} the {disfmarker} the maximal gain , it 's {disfmarker} from the IBM {pause} people , may be in long stretches of connected speech . So it 's basically a whole bunch of words {vocalsound} which they can really do , because of the continuity within that person 's turn . So , what I 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this , {comment} but {disfmarker} but what I 'm thinking is that {vocalsound} in the EDU meetings , they tend to be {vocalsound} driven by a couple of dominant speakers . And , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , {vocalsound} then , when {disfmarker} when it got s patched together when it comes back from IBM , we can add the backchannels . It seems to me {vocalsound} that {vocalsound} um , you know , the backchannels per - se wouldn't be so hard , but then there 's this question of the time {pause} @ @ {comment} uh , marking , and whether the beeps would be {vocalsound} uh y y y And I 'm not exactly sure how that {disfmarker} how that would work with the {disfmarker} with the backchannels . And , so um {disfmarker} And certainly things that are {vocalsound} intrusions of multiple words , {vocalsound} taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred , {vocalsound} that would be hard . So , m my {vocalsound} thought is {pause} i I 'm having this transcriber go through {vocalsound} the EDU - one meeting , and indicate a start time {nonvocalsound} f for each dominant speaker , endpoi end time for each dominant speaker , and the idea that {vocalsound} these units would be generated for the dominant speakers , {vocalsound} and maybe not for the other channels ."
