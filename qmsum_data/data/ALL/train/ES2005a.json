Afterwards, the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size was unanimously considered to be the most essential. In the end, Marketing was assigned to investigate market competition and design, and User Interface thinking about shapes, colours and other attributes which would attract customers."

Therefore, in order to increase customers' willingness to spend so much money on one single remote control, the features must be satisfying and good enough. The second was the competition since there were other TV remote controls in the market. The new TV remote controls shall be special and different from the rest so as to attract customers.",
