Next, the presentation of the bright blue snail shaped prototype was made by Industrial Designer and User Interface, introducing the appearance and features of the remote. Then, feedback was given regarding the prototype, which was mainly positive and speech recognition and cute appearance were decided as its star feature. Afterwards, the team discussed the financing of the remote, which should be within the budget of twelve fifty euros. Finally, the meeting ended with a project evaluation, which everyone was satisfied with the product and dynamic of the team, and team building."

For the interface, it should have nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons and switches to control features, colour contrast, sharpness etc. Interface Designer said that looks would be very important for the remote so the remote should be child-friendly with few buttons and could be colourful with star-shaped or other shaped buttons. An oversized remote was presented but was challenged by the team. Speech recognition was a feature that Interface Designer wanted to include.",

For the components, there would be a resistor, a capacitor, a diode transistor, resonator, and if possible, a rechargeable battery. Also, it should have an integrated circuit board that was highly sophisticated, temperature resistant and inexpensive. Furthermore, it was hoped that there would be a timer or alarm. For the working design, morse code would be relayed to the generator for amplification after buttons were pressed. The team thought push buttons were better than scroll wheel as the former was more practical and cheap.",

It was compact so it could easily fit in the hand and buttons could be easily accessed. Moreover, the material for the case would be plastic but the buttons would be made with soft rubber. For the light emitting diode of the LED, it would be fluorescent green and it would be a bulb like an ordinary infrared. Last but not least, there would be an oyster-shaped holder for the remote.",

            "answer": "Marketing liked how users could reach all the buttons with one thumb, even for someone with a small hand, so users did not need to shift it around or operate with two hands. Also, it was good that the on-off button was in a prominent place and the colours of the remote were attractive. Mute buttons were on either side so it would work for left- or right-handed people. On the other hand, channel buttons would be inscribed with numbers and the rest would be marked with easily recognized symbols that would be ideal for the international market.",

Another selling point would be its appearance as it would be the cutest remote control. The snail image could be used as a visual attraction.

For the case, it would be double-curved and made from plastic in special colours, whereas buttons would come in different forms and colour and would be made in rubber or wood. In addition, there would be no clock. With the cost of eight twenty, the remote was within budget with the cost of voice recognizer excluded. Only four thirty euros was left to cover it so they would have to settle with what they get within the budget with no money for other special features.",

From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does .
