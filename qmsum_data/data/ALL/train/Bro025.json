The professor thought that further tweaking and incorporation of a neural network would improve their scores. The team discussed which method to use for noise suppression, which had not been decided yet. They also delved into a more detailed discussion of the VAD and latency. Their method for noise estimation would add a notable delay to the model. Finally, the team delved further into how to finish up the model."
