Marketing first reported their findings of market potentials. Altogether, they summarized four conclusions: (1) consumers were willing to spend more for fancy products (2) the current products didn't always match users' operating behaviours (3) a lot of buttons weren't used (4) they were not fun to use. Then, the team came up with a novel feature of automatic speech recognition to retrieve the remotes. In the latter half of the meeting, the team decided that the following functions would be for the new remotes: speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design, programmability, glowing in dark, and integrating the logo and slogan."

Eighty percent of the users reported having the willingness to pay high for good-looking remote controls. Thirty-four percent of the consumers considered their remote controls were too difficult to operate. What's more, some companies believed that they shall have more functions in their remote controls. However, rather than having more functions and making it complicated, they shall emphasize what actually customers wanted and what they operated.

First of all, the team realized the requirement for beautiful products, thus aiming to design good-looking and appropriate TV remote controls in order to enhance the sales. Second, since about one-third of the consumers reported to have difficulties in using their remotes, the team then agreed to reduce the numbers of buttons. Lastly, they decided to add speech recognition to their products because people from fifteen to thirty (the age group contained most of the consumers) enjoyed this function very much.",

            "answer": "Altogether, there were three advantages. The first was the simplicity of use. In the market, lots of remotes had many buttons because companies believed that more buttons they added, the more their consumers would appreciate. However, the fact was that many people didn't know how to use these buttons at all. The redundant buttons only increased the difficulties for people to use. The second was the decrease in cost since fewer buttons were needed. The last was the increase in sales and profits.",

First, the new remotes would dis-include teletext because that was obsolete. Second, they wanted to integrate the corporate colour and slogan in the new design.

            "answer": "According to the Project Manager, it was hard to have speech recognition in remotes and no products in the market now used this function well. There was mainly one reason: the noise interference problem, which was too expensive to solve. Luckily, the User Interface came up with an idea to have something built into the TV that people could press and then it would send out a little signal. The Industrial Designer agreed and proposed to have a microphone by the TV speaker and a transmitter there to send back to their remotes. Such design was subtractive cancellation of the noise.",

And what we got was , we found that {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . They are not so good looking . So , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . So even if the available market goes for the available {disfmarker} uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls ."

Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also .
