Industrial Designer gave the first presentation, stating the personal preference for components designs. User Interface delivered the second. It led to a following discussion about basic function types as well as the size of their buttons. Next, Marketing's presentation identified the three most important aspects of remote design and expressed the focus on the trend on the elder market. As such, the group started to discuss how to meet the satisfaction of different age markets with the design. After that, Project Manager steered the meeting to further questions, including technical functions, material, color design, buttons functionality, and docking station design."

However, this idea was disagreed by other group members for the following reasons. First, a big LCD screen was too expensive. Second, most users read the information on TV and the Internet instead of the remote. Next, LCD had a vulnerable feature and was also too functional to match the basic design concept. Moreover, for User Interface suggested that the design required only one specialty, LCD was not that necessary when the group had already decided on the docking station.",
