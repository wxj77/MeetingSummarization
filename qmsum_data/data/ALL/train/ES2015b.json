They also removed some of the functions being discussed such as LCD screen, teletext and voice recognition, because they wanted to stick with a simplistic design. On design wise, the group finalized on the colour yellow as their product appearance and they chose illuminated buttons as one of their highlights.

This type of material was made up of specific alloys of metals which have a shape memory, and it also allowed recycling. Hence, the product manager lifted out the point that the company could recycle the old remote controls from customers and take down the usable parts to make new remote controls. Even though the team liked the idea, the product manager also raised his concern towards the financial budget.

One way was to make it multi-functional, so as to be used for several entertainment devices. Another way was to make it single-functional, which could be used specifically for the television. The entire group preferred the product to be single-functional. It is because making an original design was more obtainable, and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic.

So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . Um , from {disfmarker} Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . A automatically , um lights up at first touch . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . Um , also we could use um an alarm .
