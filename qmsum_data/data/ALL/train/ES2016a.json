Their discussion included its versatility, anti-loss design and possible appearance, but there was no final decision on these matters. The team agreed that the remote control should be one-handed, user-friendly and globally attractive. In addition, they noticed that these ideas should be realized under the price target and balance the stability and design sense of the remote control."

Based on the reality that the remote control is often lost in our life, he thought that they should add anti loss design into it.

The remote control needs to be longer to indicate the direction of the remote control.

What if we had what if we had not only um {disfmarker} say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to .

So the grip is {disfmarker} No , that wouldn't work either um . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , um and then {vocalsound} flat uh {disfmarker} And then we have the problem with the hinge . So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want ."
