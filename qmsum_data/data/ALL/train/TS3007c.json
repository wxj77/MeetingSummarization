Finally, Project Manager shared some master class knowledge with group mates and suggested applying a marketing campaign, large provider marketing approach, and real reaction product idea."

Next, Marketing presented market trends and suggested the group should focus on the main audience and use fresh colours, rubber materials, speech function, and the log-in functionality with the slogan.
