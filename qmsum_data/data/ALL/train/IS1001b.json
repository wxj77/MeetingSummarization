Apart from the requirements for a fancier look, shock-resistance, and limited but usable buttons, other expectations were also raised by users, such as the need to be found, to easily use, to light in the dark, and the need of ergonomic design. Moreover, LCD and speech recognition also seemed important, especially for people between 15 and 25 who watched TV a lot. Last but not least, the previous plan for a generic remote control for everything failed due to the imbalance between the long developing time and the timely need to be on the market.",
