The user interface designer first introduced three concepts in the user interface - Google controller, fancy controller, and intelligent controller. The first two were approved by the project manager, but the last one was seriously questioned. The group finally decided to mix the Google controller and fancy controller with some simple vocal commands. The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects \u2014material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood and having buttons with LCD, applying the classical battery and solar energy alimentation, and using low level chips, which was agreed by the group. The marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis. Users would like to have a fancy look and feel and the product should be technologically innovative. At the same time, being user-friendly was also important. Then the group discussed how to make these requirements into practice."

More importantly, although the feature was not one hundred percent reliable, it was a feature to distinguish the new product from traditional ones. And there's not enough motivation for users to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller.",

            "answer": "The project manager put forward that the speech recognition wouldn't work when several persons wanted to change the channel at the same time, and the cost would surely rise if adding the two technologies. In response to that, the user interface designer said they would just cooperate with some research institute and the vocabulary was limited, so it wouldn't cost much. Then the project manager posed the language problem. The user interface designer answered they would have some language adaptations so the product could be used by people from all countries. Finally, there were still problems with the microphone and camera that were necessary for the two technologies.",

Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um"
