Firstly, Marketing gave a presentation on the remote control market trend and suggested a fancy look as well as technology innovation features. Secondly, User Interface presented on technical function design and recommended changeable fonts on remote buttons and a modern look with a handheld shape. Thirdly, Industrial Designer presented on component design and suggested a soft material case with flashy colors and transparent buttons. Industrial Designer thought the normal infrared LED should be sufficient. Lastly, the group discussed the remote's features and they decided to have features including normal battery, scroll wheel, round shape, and speech recognition."
