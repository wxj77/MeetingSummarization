Firstly, the group had a prototype discussion on the remote control's scroll wheel, standard place, the round shape, the multiple speech buttons, the menu buttons, and the text button with hard plastic material. Next, the group evaluated remote's look, ease of use, and technological innovation based on different criteria. Lastly, the group discussed that the production price would be 12.3 Euros, and the target price would be 20 Euros. Finally, they posed a quick challenge on using the magic pen and the board to draw design features."
