Industrial Designer presented the prototype as a clam-shell design with a flip-top LCD touch screen and fully closed flat buttons at the bottom. There would be a wide choice of colours and patterns due to customization. Inside the remote control, there would be a standard chip and a kinetic battery. The team was under the budget at present. Once the budget increased, however, the voice recognition would be incorporated. The remote control's fashion style and location function were most highly rated among the team members, but the minimization of repetitive strain injury was not satisfying enough. All members gave their sincere feedback on teamwork and leadership."
