    "answer": "lynne neagle am : we 've got some specific questions now on implementation for social services , from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : thank you , chair . if this bill becomes law , would you encourage members of the public to contact social services departments if they do see a child being smacked ? sally jenkins : we already encourage members of the public to contact social services or the police , depending on the circumstances . interestingly , i 'm picking\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : what , if a child is being smacked now ? sally jenkins : yes . if a child is being smacked now , we would ask that people contact . we have a duty to report , as professionals . but if you were walking out , and you saw something happening to a child , in the same way as if you saw something to an adult . janet finch-saunders am : right . sally jenkins : so , i think that the challenge is about\u2014we 've all probably , sadly , witnessed incidents in the doctor 's reception , or in a supermarket , and we 've failed to do something about it . and i think we then walk away and feel pretty guilty about that , realistically , when you see something happening to a child in a particular circumstance . i think we ca n't ignore the fact that a child is being assaulted in those circumstances . janet finch-saunders am : okay . thank you . a campaign opposing this bill , be reasonable wales , have said that 'if the law is changed , the consequences for parents will be considerable . ' it also says , 'anyone accused or convicted of assaulting a child\u2014under the new definition\u2014 ' so , i suppose you could argue , a minor tap\u2014 'will be subject to long-term social services involvement in their family and social stigma . ' to what extent is this accurate , and , also , will thresholds for social services intervention change if the bill is enacted ? sally jenkins : there are a number of parts to that . firstly , in terms of long-term social services intervention in a family 's life , i think , for people to be fully aware of the very few numbers of families where we have long-term intervention currently , even where there is what would be perceived as very significant abuse . what we do is we go in for short periods in families ' lives , to support them to work with their strengths , to work with them and their family members . it 's not about us going into families , whatever some of the public perception may be . our aim is to get in and get out . so , in terms of long-term intervention , what we want is for families to find their own solutions . we want families to be able to work with each other , and together , and local community support , and preventative services , to be able to address issues . this is not about punitive approaches from social services . so , that 's the first element . in terms of thresholds for children 's services , we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us . there may be a small number of referrals that come through . what we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle . we recognise that 's likely to happen . because we also know that this is actually quite a rare occurrence currently ; this is not a defence that 's being used with great frequency , this is not something that is happening . and if we look at the data , we know that the incidents of children , and the number of parents who now recognise this as an acceptable form of punishment , has steadily declined over the last 15 to 20 years . so it 's diminishing as it is . janet finch-saunders am : so , on that one then , is there a need for legislation that will\u2014obviously there 'll be resources for the welsh government and there 'll be resources out of hours and things like that\u2014is there a need for legislation if , as you say , natural behaviour and the culture is changing ? let 's be honest , as you 've rightly pointed out , in social services\u2014i know in my own authority\u2014in your own authority , you 're saying that even now you 're working with the police , on systematic failings within the system . sally jenkins : two things . firstly , we want legislation that reflects our society\u2014we do n't want the two to be out of kilter . that would be my first natural response : surely our legislation should be reflective of what our world is . it should n't be that we 've got these rather confusing elements running in parallel , and that continues to perpetuate a lack of clarity and the ambiguity that we currently see . i think the other element is that , again , this is about potentially an accelerating of that awareness and that culture in our society , about how we care for our children . we 've got there naturally ; we 've got there by the change that 's happened in wales over the last 15 to 20 years . what this does is to continue with that change and continue with that awareness and understanding of how we positively , from a strength-based approach , should care for our children , bearing in mind what 's required of us in terms of the uncrc . janet finch-saunders am : okay . are there any comments from anyone else ? huw david : simply to say that i think that , in terms of that clarity for the very vulnerable children out there who are currently being assaulted\u2014seriously assaulted and abused by their parents , which goes on on a daily basis\u2014that is already covered by existing legislation . but at the moment , they do n't know , because they could be being told\u2014and they probably are being told\u2014by their parents that 's it 's okay , that they can smack their child and that that 's acceptable . they do n't know the difference . a young child is not going to know that difference and there is confusion about what is\u2014 . and if you asked most parents , and in fact lots of professionals , they would not be able to tell you , and probably most of you would n't be able to tell me exactly where is the threshold\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : yes , where 's that line . huw david : well , at the moment , we do n't know where that line is . that vulnerable child , at home , being abused by their parents , does not know where that line is . and they should know where that line is because then they can pick up the phone to childline or they can talk to a professional and ask them where that line is . so , that would be a step forward . i do recognise , though , that what we do n't want to do\u2014and the last thing any of us want to do\u2014is criminalise parents who are bringing up their children . that is why we 're saying there needs to be an emphasis on the support programmes that are available to parents . and to be clear , there is no way that we want long-term involvement in any child 's life , but particularly not in the lives of children who have been smacked by their parents . that is not going to be the result of this legislation , trust me , because we do n't want to be involved in\u2014we have n't got the resources to be involved in children 's lives . the social worker or the police officer\u2014if they become involved , then there would be a proportionate response to that , and there 'll also be a test about whether or not that is progressed . so , if there is an allegation\u2014if this legislation is passed\u2014then that will be looked into and a consideration will be made about whether any action will be taken , and as with any allegation of the law being broken , there would be a proportionate response , as there is now . lynne neagle am : and the next question does relate to the practical response to that . janet . janet finch-saunders am : yes . can you outline the practical ways in which social services ' interaction with parents will change as a result of this proposed law and do you envisage that all referrals to the police will be automatically referred to social services for an assessment ? who 's going to make those decisions ? sally jenkins : that will be part of the implementation phase about that decision making . interestingly , the number of referrals that we currently get from the police that we take absolutely no action on is extraordinary . so , we get a very , very large number of\u2014 . it will be happening now ; sitting in the civic centre in newport city council will be a whole host of social workers taking in the public protection notifications from overnight . it 's 10 o'clock , so they 're assessing them now , as we speak . and an awful lot of those will have no further action from the local authority . janet finch-saunders am : but will they be investigated ? sally jenkins : no . there will be no action . there are countless referrals made by agencies to local authorities that we take no action on . janet finch-saunders am : so , if there 's an increase as a result of greater awareness\u2014 sally jenkins : what happens is there is a paper assessment of them . there 's a look at what 's happened , who 's involved , what the police have reported , and there 's work being done with the police to improve that . because one of the things that we want to get to is actually where we 're not using huge amounts of time to look at that , but what comes to us is what we act on . so , there is work going on with a number of police authorities to look at how you improve that process . but i suppose , to pick up , each incident will be looked at , each one will be assessed in a way that is proportionate , as huw says , to look at what 's happened and then investigated . lynne neagle am : sally , can you give us a couple of examples of what kind of things might have come in that you would then take no action on ? sally jenkins : we get countless referrals , for example , where there 's been a domestic abuse incident overnight where a child was n't present in the property and we then have n't taken action . it \u2019 ll be where the level of harm that \u2019 s perceived to happen to that child is below the threshold for intervention from children 's services . janet finch-saunders am : i \u2019 m pretty cynical about assessment , because , you know , i have people come in who are benefit claimants where , when they \u2019 ve been assessed , the whole process has been very flawed and i \u2019 ve had to fight and fight and fight on their behalf . so\u2014 sally jenkins : assessment processes within social\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : but if you 're struggling now with those assessments\u2014 sally jenkins : assessment processes within social services are as laid out in the social services and well-being ( wales ) act 2014 . so , we have within what we carry out , i suppose , that kind of initial look , that look at the information , what else do we know about that family\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : and are they qualified people that are doing this ? sally jenkins : yes , absolutely . huw david : and , in fact , in lots of places in wales now , it \u2019 s a multi-agency assessment . so , it \u2019 s a joint assessment carried out with police professionals and health professionals . janet finch-saunders am : so , what proportion currently would you not be taking any action on , if a report came in of some domestic abuse where a child had perhaps been smacked ? sally jenkins : if something came in to us where a child had been smacked and there was something clearly there , we would look at it . we would clearly look at it and we would take some sort of action . janet finch-saunders am : even now , before the legislation ? lynne neagle am : can you ask a final question ? and i 'm going to have to appeal for brief answers , because we 've got a lot of ground to cover . huw david : just very quickly , there may be no action from social services , but it doesn \u2019 t mean that we don \u2019 t offer support . so , the expectation is that support is offered in those circumstances from family support services , for example\u2014 sally jenkins : or prevention . huw david : \u2014or prevention services . so , we would not say , if we were aware , for example , that there was domestic abuse at a home , \u2018 there \u2019 s no role for children \u2019 s social services \u2019 , because there may be an assessment that that child may not be at immediate risk of harm , but we would obviously recognise that there are causes for concern there and we would offer that support . so , just to be clear about that . and that \u2019 s a process that happens in every social services department in the uk , and it \u2019 s happened for a very long time , and , in fact , it \u2019 s reflective of the legislation that you have laid down as assembly members . lynne neagle am : and are those services there , huw ? because i \u2019 m very acutely aware of the pressure on local government . are the services there ? is there sufficient resource in things like families first ? because what i \u2019 m hearing on the ground is that eligibility is changing for even those preventative services . huw david : there \u2019 s not enough of those services , and , obviously\u2014you may have heard me saying this before\u2014i think we need to invest more in those services , and i hope you invest more in the services , because , obviously , prevention is better than cure . and those pressures that sally talked about earlier are pressures that are not going away ; they \u2019 re only increasing by the day , actually , and i would want us to be able to offer those services now . because that example of a child that perhaps is in a home where there is domestic abuse\u2014we \u2019 ll probably have another referral off them in a couple of months \u2019 time , and that could escalate . and what i \u2019 d rather do is provide support to that family and try and stop that family breaking down so that , in six months , we 're not going back and saying that we 've got to take this child into care because the domestic abuse has worsened and that child is at risk . but those services need additional investment . sally jenkins : i appreciate that time is of the essence , but , just really quickly in relation to that , it \u2019 s not just social services . so , for example , there are developments like encompass , which is a piece of work that is being rolled out across gwent and across other areas , which is where the police automatically notify the school overnight of an incident , not expecting the school to do anything per se , but to be aware , to be able to offer care for that child . alastair birch : can i add to that ? operation encompass i know in gwent has been operational , and we started it in pembrokeshire 18 months ago . we as a local authority\u2014and it \u2019 ll be education that will contact the school around the domestic incident happening , and the school as part of that protocol will provide a level of universal service support for that child when they come in , before 9 o \u2019 clock , so that professionals are aware of the needs of the welfare of that child at that point . so , you know , schools play a key role in the universal service of this and we work very closely with our social care colleagues on that . lynne neagle am : okay . janet , your last question , please . janet finch-saunders am : the bill 's explanatory memorandum refers to an estimate of 274 offences annually where lawful chastisement was used as a defence or considered . it says there is also potential to create extra demand on out-of-hours social services teams due to the time that the offences were reported , and in order to support safeguarding measures . have you assessed how this bill will impact on emergency and out-of-hours local authority services ? sally jenkins : we have considered that , and again i think that 's something that we would very much want to look at as part of implementation . we have out-of-hours provision , we have emergency duty teams already across wales that operate 24/7 . there 's no doubt that they exist and they work very closely with our police colleagues . janet finch-saunders am : are they overstretched at the moment ?"
