    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about the functions that the new remote controls would have .",
    "answer": "project manager : we had that um to dis-include teletext um because it 's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . um , dunno what oracle would have to say with that but never mind . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : um it 's only for the television , which i 'm presuming means it 's for a specific television , user interface : okay . project manager : and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . user interface : corporate colour . project manager : yellow . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yellow . project manager : i presume . um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything 's yellow . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : and the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh i do n't know exactly how sort of incorpor i mean , i guess if you 're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . user interface : yeah . project manager : uh , where am i ? user interface : okay . project manager : speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , lcd interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons so we 'll pretty much take that one as read . user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : we 'll use the the basic functions for a television . no teletext . um okay hold on . user interface : although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . project manager : not enough buttons you mean ? user interface : yeah . project manager : so sorta strike a balance between a a few and a user interface : well project manager : or it looks like we 're just cutting on the um user interface : mm . on the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff . project manager : i do however have this from over my head , that they do n't want teletext on it . user interface : mm-hmm , okay . okay , cool . project manager : uh maybe raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they 'll send marketing : about cost . project manager : some information about that , about um what people , whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . marketing : okay . project manager : okay um . so uh i take it your position arlo is that the bells and whistles we 've got ta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . industrial designer : yeah yeah . project manager : um so i mean a a the sort of inkling i 'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that i 'm getting sent is that they 're quite interested in a t_f_t_ display , interactive display . however that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry raj um said people did n't like . although i guess if there 's a sort of user interface : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . project manager : if you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of windows-style drop down menus or whatever , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : i think maybe that 's a bit , going a bit far user interface : yeah . project manager : but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple . user interface : yeah . okay . project manager : um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? user interface : um glow in the dark material i was thinking . project manager : okay . so marketing : i user interface : um , so i i guess that would be cheaper than a light i think . marketing : uh may i say something about ? project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : uh actually i think it 's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . but user interface : often lost s was that , marketing : yeah are lost project manager : lost , yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . but if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . marketing : like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , project manager : that 's cool . user interface : mm-hmm , marketing : and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales , project manager : that 's cool . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so we should take it into consideration also . project manager : okay , cool . industrial designer : well hmm . project manager : um speech recognition i take it user interface : industrial designer : oh it 's project manager : i do n't , i 've i know of no products um that use speech recognition well . industrial designer : they 're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . you could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh b_b_c_ one and it goes to that channel . project manager : really ? industrial designer : yeah , it did n't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . they mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to b_b_c_ one . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for b_b_c_ two on b_b_c_ one 'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . industrial designer : right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you 'd be watching the tv and then all of a sudden it 'd it 'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , project manager : mm . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but if you can work around that that noise problem user interface : 'kay . project manager : uh-huh . user interface : well what about industrial designer : user interface : this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that 's built into the tv um that you can press and it 'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we ca n't hear or something project manager : ah , that 's a good idea . user interface : um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . industrial designer : right . project manager : so like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . user interface : if you find if y industrial designer : right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : what you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the tv speaker , or not a remo i 'm sorry , a microphone by the tv speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you ca n't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their tvs . user interface : mm . yeah , that 's the only thing , yeah . industrial designer : but yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the tv speaker project manager : that we should just stick on , yeah . industrial designer : which user interface : that comes with our remote control . industrial designer : right , and then the remote control would know um what 's being produced by the television . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : and that 's a sort of basic r_f_ kind of frequency so it 'll be cheap . industrial designer : right , right . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : right , right . um . yeah that 's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . if you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you do n't even need to find it . you just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the tv on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it 's within you know , within hearing range . and uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you 've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . project manager : uh-huh . user interface : that could also be built into the tv though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : well , hopefully we 're uh we 're ahead of the curve . project manager : it might do us out of a job . user interface : yeah , okay . project manager : um okay . i like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . um so i think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , so i th user interface : and the expense . project manager : yeah and expense and the time . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so i think if we 're going to go well i mean like the thing about the there 's the problem with the t_f_t_ or the lcd kind of thing is if you 're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . um , but i guess not i thin we 'll just we 'll just pretend that 's not a problem . um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? is that user interface : maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that 's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . project manager : contrast contra well . industrial designer : yeah , no th the material 's cheap but it 's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then uh if you 're , if you 're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it wo n't glow any more . project manager : yeah , okay . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so if it 's dow it 's d uh yeah . or if it 's down under the couch cushions industrial designer : right . project manager : um which is where i usually find mine . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : right . project manager : um okay , well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , user interface : yeah , project manager : um if we 're gon na have to user interface : 'cause what i thought , main project manager : if we 're gon na have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our um slogan . user interface : slogan , yeah . project manager : uh then you know they 're gon na be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . user interface : right . mm-hmm . 'cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you 're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : alright , so n sorta if if if we 're gon if we 're gon na go with the idea of um uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . user interface : that was more of a a gimmick . project manager : do you think ? uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then . user interface : yeah , unnecessary . yeah . project manager : okay . um , okay so scratch that . uh so we 've got do we want to go with the t_f_t_ idea or the is that far too expensive ? industrial designer : um yeah we 're getting a lot of features now , i i think project manager : well i mean i think i think the sort of find the finder things i mean it 's uh i could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um industrial designer : well , i think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around , there 's a good chance the the t_f_t_ screen would break or uh get damaged . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : they 're pretty fragile . project manager : okay . user interface : so is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a t_f_t_ screen ? project manager : um no , i mean that was going on ravs uh raj 's sort of um marketing research i guess . um uh so we 'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . um . so that 's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um industrial designer : yeah mm . project manager : uh you were finding out about teletext . marketing : yeah . project manager : if you could find out that uh marketing : totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi project manager : um i think we 're gon na scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a um expensive , user interface : yeah you think so ? industrial designer : oh no it 's it 's much cheaper than the t_f_t_ , it 's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . project manager : no ? oh right , okay . industrial designer : and it 'd it 'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , project manager : is it not the circuits that cost industrial designer : like a project manager : oh right , okay . uh well that kind of takes back the r_f_ the r_f_ remote sort of idea as well . user interface : okay . industrial designer : project manager : um . five minutes . okay . decisions . uh , votes , let 's vote . who wants t_f_t_ ? industrial designer : project manager : no-one does . marketing : project manager : excellent , so we 'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? industrial designer : okay . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm , that 's cool . project manager : um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . and what else was i thinking of that i have n't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability . marketing : glow in dark . project manager : uh user interface : if it 's not too expensive s i think it 's a good gimmick . project manager : uh o okay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : okay , so . um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they 're not already in there as well . so , it just helps me summarize them . industrial designer : yeah yeah . marketing : here ? sure . industrial designer : project manager : and um i 'll put any i 'm i 'm putting anything i do in there anyway , so uh user interface : and where is it sorry ? project manager : uh pro uh project documents . industrial designer : so it should be when you save project manager : on ami scenario controller . industrial designer : on your desktop , so it goes save as , or user interface : oh . marketing : uh it is in shared documents ? industrial designer : and then uh hit that little folder up thing again . project manager : where am i ? marketing : projoct uh projector . industrial designer : again . project manager : project documents , yeah , it 's on your desktop as well . industrial designer : all the way to the top , yeah that 's up to desktop . right and then project documents . user interface : okay , cool . marketing : hmm . it is not giving anything . project manager : marketing : shared documents . project manager : and i will tr getting strings of um information , i 'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as i get them now , rather than i was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so user interface : okay . industrial designer : mm . did you get my email ? okay . project manager : i did . industrial designer : just making sure . project manager : user interface : okay . project manager : so user interface : what i thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , it 's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . um , a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic project manager : okay . user interface : and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : the rubber rather than project manager : more sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of . user interface : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . marketing : um but we have to take care like project manager : industrial designer : user interface : marketing : but we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it should n't be too harmful . so , whatever material we use it should be yeah . project manager : oh no , ethics , that 's gon na cost us money . user interface : marketing : so we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . project manager : okay , safety . user interface : oh i think wi with the more organic shape of it it wo n't be as it wo n't as have many sharp corners as that , so that 's something good , um project manager : yeah . user interface : i dunno , i mean industrial designer : we could go comp yeah . project manager : it sme smells good for children . user interface : industrial designer : we could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and it 's got the thing on the inside . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : and there 's no buttons at all , it 's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . marketing : project manager : that sounds , user interface : that 's a good idea . industrial designer : and then ch children will love it . project manager : yeah it 's gon na have to be it 's gon na be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry . user interface : interesting . industrial designer : oh yellow , yellow ball . right . user interface : yeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ? project manager : please god no . um . well , i would n't th i mean , my reaction to an all-yellow remote control would n't be anything other than horror , so i think just having it user interface : yeah . marketing : small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it . project manager : surrounding the logo . user interface : having a little bit . okay cool . mm mm . project manager : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm , okay . project manager : and i 'll see if i can argue with boss about putting the user interface : cool . project manager : what was it ? we put we put fashion into whoops , it 's not working . ca n't believe i 've forgotten it . we put the fashion in electronics . i bet that 'll catch on well . user interface : oh yeah , that 's a good one that . yeah so . project manager : okay , any last marketing : yeah . industrial designer : twelve thirty . project manager : worries , queries ? okay . industrial designer : project manager : s s i know what you 're thinking . industrial designer : marketing : user interface : project manager : okay then , lunchtime , yay . marketing : that 's good ."
