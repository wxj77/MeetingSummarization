    "query": "<s> what did julie morgan think about a light smack from a loving parent when talking about the bill to ban physical punishment ?",
    "answer": "janet finch-saunders am : good morning . thank you , chair . good morning , deputy minister . of those individuals who responded to our written consultation in a personal capacity , nearly 70 per cent do not support this bill . we also heard a clear message from the parents we met last week who oppose this bill that , as parents , they understand clearly the difference between child abuse and a light smack from a loving parent . how would you like to respond to that ? julie morgan am : thank you very much , janet , for that question . i think i 'd like to start by saying that child abuse is not the issue that the bill is trying to address . what the bill is trying to do is prohibit all forms of physical punishment , and that is in order to protect children 's rights and to ensure that children have the same protection from physical punishment as adults . but i do understand that people have different views , and that 's why this process has been so important\u2014for us to hear what your views are and what parents ' views are . i know that , often , people use different euphemisms really to make light of physical punishment . i 've heard expressions used such as a 'light smack ' or a 'loving smack ' or a 'tap ' , and really there can be different interpretations of what is a 'light smack ' , what is a 'loving smack ' , and that does n't really cover the issue of the frequency of such actions being taken . but i would say that , however mild it seems to be , the united nations committee on the rights of the child recognises that any physical punishment of children , however minor , is incompatible with their human rights , and why should a big person hit a little person ? that 's been the sort of mantra , really , that has taken me through supporting this legislation\u2014that it just seems wrong to me that there is something in the law that could mean that there could be an excuse for that happening . i believe we should n't have anything in the law that defends the physical punishment of children , and i do n't think we should be defining acceptable ways of hitting or punishing children , because i think it does send a confused message to children . it says , 'it 's okay for me to hit you , but do n't you hit anybody else . ' i think it causes confusion . so , i 'm confident that updating the law will make it much clearer for parents and people working with children\u2014and , of course , i 'm sure , as you 'll have heard from the evidence you 've taken , that people who work with children are overwhelmingly in support of this legislation , and the representative surveys that we 've carried out show support for the bill 's principles . janet finch-saunders am : thank you , deputy minister . last week , during the workshop , a few parents\u2014predominantly all of them , actually\u2014said that they use a gentle tap or smacking as part of a toolkit of ways to deal with challenging behaviour or , sometimes , for the safety of the child or , indeed , to carry out the parenting of a child . how do you intend to work with parents going forward , given the finite resources that social care and social services have ? i know from the responses we 've received to the consultation that parents themselves who have to parent 24 hours a day , seven days a week , they are really , on the scale of things , very upset about this . how do you intend to try and get your message across to those parents on removing what they consider to be part of their toolkit when raising children ? how do you intend to deal with that aspect ? julie morgan am : well , first of all , i want to say , as i 've said in most evidence sessions , that i completely accept that bringing up children is hard . it 's very difficult ; many of us have done it and we know how tough it can be . but we do n't think that there is any place for physical punishment in bringing up children . there 's a whole range of other ways that you can help parents bring up children , and advice you can give them of different methods to use . but , the clear message of this bill is that we do n't want any physical punishment ; we do n't think it 's the right thing to do , and we believe that we are supported by many people in that view ."
