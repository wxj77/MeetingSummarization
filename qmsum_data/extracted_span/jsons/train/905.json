industrial designer : a_ l_ i_ m_ a_ . project manager : thanks . industrial designer : oh , and i guess i 'm the industrial designer on this project . so let 's see if i can get marketing : industrial designer : um here . i will draw a little turtle for you all . not necessarily 'cause it 's my absolute favourite animal , but just that i think they 're drawable . and you have the pretty little shell going on . some little eyes . happy . there you go . that 's a turtle . project manager : so what are your favourite characteristics ? industrial designer : um . i i like the whole having a shell thing . it 's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they 're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they 're easy to draw . project manager : excellent . user interface : project manager : shall we just go around the table ? user interface : uh okay . well , my name is iain uh and i 'm the user interface designer for the project . um . and i 'll try and draw my favourite animal . industrial designer : no , user interface : i 'll i should leave that one on there industrial designer : you can erase the turtle , user interface : should n't i before i callously rub it off . industrial designer : it 's alright . project manager : might be nice to have them all up there at same time . user interface : um i 'm not gon na draw it quite to scale um . industrial designer : user interface : is that at least identifiable ? industrial designer : snake . marketing : well . industrial designer : well , user interface : it 's a whale , yes . industrial designer : snake ? it 's w user interface : thanks . marketing : oh my god , it 's better than what i 'm gon na be able to do . user interface : um and , yeah , the reason i like whales is 'cause uh they 're well , first of all they 're quite intelligent um and also they 're they 're kind of mysterious , like we do n't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . and i just find them interesting animals . marketing : take my contraptions with me . alright , i 'm jessy . i 'm from around d_c_ ish sort of in the u_s_ . and we 're gon na keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , animal . do n't really know how to draw this . just where can i mm . mm . maybe if i do the water , industrial designer : marketing : but how ? sort of give an idea . i have no idea how one would explain this . mm maybe with some whiskers . briefly , it 's supposed to be a seal . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : you can imagine it in the water . i like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . not gon na try and pretend like i can get any better than that . project manager : mm 'kay . mm 'kay ? i 'm rose and i 'm project manager , from california . um . hmm . s industrial designer : oh , marketing : it 's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . industrial designer : a cat . project manager : um it 's actually a coyote . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : let 's see . let 's see , industrial designer : right . marketing : that 's impressive . project manager : let 's give it a little bit of a snout , i do n't know , some teeth . industrial designer : that 's project manager : yeah . industrial designer : that 's pretty impressive . user interface : cool . project manager : oh dear . yes . industrial designer : project manager : i live um i live right across the street from an open space in california . we have coyotes howl all the time . so i really enjoy their their singing , you they 're really beautiful animals . mm . okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . we 're gon na talk about project finances . um we have a couple we 'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it 's a we have a market range of internet , like it 's an international market range , we do n't have to worry about specifics . um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro . so we 're selling it for twice what we 'd like to produce it for . okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , i could i 'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you do n't like , etcetera , so marketing : um i hate when there 's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the tv like you have to do one for the power of the tv and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , i do n't know . now they keep combining all different remotes together , and i do n't know if i necessarily like that 'cause i feel like you end up with multimedia overload . user interface : marketing : i just wan na watch the tv um . always gets lost . some sort of like device to help you find it . user interface : i 've used , i 've used remote controls , for things like tv and the c_d_ player and video recorder and i i guess they 're they 're pretty neat neat little tools uh . you do n't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . so especially if you 're someone really lazy like me they they 're pretty nice . um . i find them they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if i 'm watching tv i have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the tv , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . um . and also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they 've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all i really wan na do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume . industrial designer : yeah um . i agree with having too many remotes around . my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and i do n't know how to work half of them um . what 's important for me , i guess , is that it 's easy to use and that there 's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you 're doing . and one thing i particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um , i think there is a way around that , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but i know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so i it 's just simpler just to just turn around the tv itself , and i think that 's if we 're gon na make a remote control , it should actually work for what it 's doing . so marketing : what about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don do n't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ? project manager : um i would imagine all of them , industrial designer : i know . project manager : but we could but it 's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double a_s . industrial designer : yeah , something that does n't marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um m_p_ three players now and that kind of thing . um . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um . okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . so um like you said you do n't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you do n't wan na have five remotes . so how do we work with that ? industrial designer : yeah . could we get something that just has no does n't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that i 'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : channel changing . marketing : and maybe that spatially divides it , so it 's like if you 're looki if you 're trying to get the tv on that 's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , i dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we 're gon na make it , but if it 's like all the tv stuff was here , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : then all the v_c_r_ stuff was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it 's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , industrial designer : n that way yeah . marketing : 'cause then you like , i do n't even know what i 'm turning on . industrial designer : yeah , and if um if you 'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would n't need to use every day . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the tvs no longer have as well . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so like you have to have them somewhere , user interface : yeah . project manager : 'cause you 're gon na m need those special functions occasionally . um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . industrial designer : right . user interface : can i ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only project manager : good question . user interface : um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? project manager : i do n't know that yet . user interface : um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? project manager : it 's a good question . um . i 'll look into that . marketing : mm-hmm hmm . project manager : if i can . user interface : marketing : i think it 's just tv , i mean , if it if we 're taking it just new product a new television remote control that 's not like does n't say . industrial designer : mm yeah . marketing : you know , things might be more advanced than that . user interface : so we should maybe we should assume that i t it 's just a television that we 're wanting to control . industrial designer : user interface : well , i mean i suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well i i do n't know if that works technologically or not . industrial designer : yes . i guess we have to define what what we 're aiming for . if it 's just a television then that it 's a bit simpler , 'cause there 's less buttons that would even need to be on it . user interface : yeah . marketing : it 's an idea with the buttons being really . industrial designer : large . if you have older people or people like me that are n't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it 's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . 'kay sounds like we 've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . mind if we move on ? ps industrial designer : project manager : mm okay . user interface : 'kay . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . i believe we 've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you 'd like um , but this is just a breakdown of what we 'll be doing individually . um the industrial design , alima will be doing um the working design . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um the user interface designer , that 's for . technical functions , i guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . um user requirements um , so you 'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um i guess kind of the same uh discussion that we 've been having , we 'll get from the actual consum s consumers . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm 'kay um . and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . i realised in this past one we we did n't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um . user interface : project manager : any questions ? industrial designer : user interface : what we 're gon na be discussing at the next meeting ? do we know that ? project manager : i have n't gotten an agenda yet , um i 'll put that together . i 'm sure as we 'll each get our own instruction user interface : right . project manager : and then um because what we gon na do is first our individual actions and then we 'll come back together . so i 'm sure we 'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time industrial designer : 'kay . i 'm sure we 'll be busy . user interface : project manager : mm 'kay um i 'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . um just including all the things that we talked about . um . user interface : okay . can you e-mail your slides as well ? is that possible ? project manager : yes , i yes , i think i can . mm-hmm . i 'll just attach it to an email . and you 're you 're number two , industrial designer : i 'm two . project manager : three , four ? marketing : i 'm four . project manager : is that correct ? okay . industrial designer : alright . project manager : excellent . it was lovely meeting you all . just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . industrial designer : 'kay ."
