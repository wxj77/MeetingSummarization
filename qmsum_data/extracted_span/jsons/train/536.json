    "query": "<s> what did marketing think of installing a new remote control when presenting the second inspiration on technology simplicity ?",
    "answer": "marketing : so this is what i 've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we 'll just read through together . um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . so they find them ugly . most people find them ugly . um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we 'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : okay i 'm gon na we 'll look at that in a second . um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . so i guess what we 're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they do n't does n't really appeal to them . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so i think what we 're doing is we 're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that 's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people 's hands . um , frustrations . they get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . um , takes time to learn how to use them . this is uh why i mention when craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it does n't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . if you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . um and i will admit i do n't know what r_s_i_ stands for . project manager : repetitive strain injury . industrial designer : is installing a new remote control something that people marketing : uh , no , that did not come up at all . um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . i also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . so i dunno if that 's possible we might consider getting into it . um . and and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wan na sell and market this , i think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that 's fashionable and sleek and trendy . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um people uh additionally are n't are n't liking the appearance of their products , so we wan na think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like ."
