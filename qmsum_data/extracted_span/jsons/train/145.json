    "answer": "marketing : so so w we ca n't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing project manager : yeah . marketing : because all of a sudden we are gon na have cost overruns . so if we drop if we are gon na choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? project manager : hmm . so if we 're keeping it basic we 're loo loo what we 're looking to sell it basically is it 's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . 'cause we really do n't have anything else there , do we ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i do n't i do n't see it , and to me if i 'm gon na market a product for b for beauty for for design i 'm gon na i 'm gon na try to market it at a much higher price . i need to make it special with a high price tag . i do n't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : i want i want to market it as exclusive . so i would market this product it at eighty-nine euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but but i do n't think we have that flexibility . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : because otherwise we 're just going to i mean even if it 's necessary or not , if you if you 're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it is n't more expensive for us to k make because as far as i understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? so it should be in there . user interface : right as far as industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i it 's just uh the cost of an extra button . i mean software-wise there 's really no difference . project manager : yeah . okay . is n't user interface : i think . marketing : i have maybe a silly question . i in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there 's gon na be the it 's gon na be out-moded teletext . i i do n't understand how those two things are connected . how does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? i do n't understand that . project manager : well maybe what we 're getting into here is the the idea of uh internet through the tv for example . so that might play on what we can do . industrial designer : yeah the they 're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that user interface : scheduling . um to find out what what you 're watching even if there 's commercials you know . industrial designer : and now yeah marketing : okay . industrial designer : and now you can c look it over internet . but i still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . user interface : i think i ha i agree . marketing : yeah 'cause , yeah , i just i do n't see the cross-over between computers and television . i mean i do see the cross-over in some sense , industrial designer : yeah , but it 's not happen yet . yeah . marketing : but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , okay . user interface : well for me project manager : well you have digital tv still already . user interface : yeah . marketing : so so if we make the cross-over and we 're gon na view television on computers then we 're then we 're losing the the necessity of the remote . s user interface : unless you have a project manager : well there there is a for example on digital tv systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , user interface : yeah . project manager : and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : a a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can yeah , and there 's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live tv and things like that . they 're just features from the internet uh from computers are are coming into the tv sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext . marketing : okay . project manager : so now the things to think here are that that there 's gon na be more functionality , potentially that we can handle . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah but we we do n't we 're not aiming a command for that . that 's the thing . and all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and user interface : i think a lot of that 's proprietary anyways . you 're not gon na be able to , you , like command a tivo with our remote . i do n't think . project manager : mm . but still there there 's an opportunity . if if it 's , for example , a trainable one then we 're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . industrial designer : yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so project manager : mm . okay . industrial designer : well i dunno . one way the other teletext was there but i guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs . user interface : i think if it 's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . just you know industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah i do n't i do n't see the logic . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i i do n't see the logic in elimination of teletext , i just i i project manager : yeah , and neither do i in fact . marketing : but i 'm not a tech-mind either . i just do n't see the cross-over between computers and and and project manager : bu uh . marketing : 'cause we are designing something for a television , okay . industrial designer : project manager : i 'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wan na be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there 's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it does n't affect the price . user interface : right it 's just not industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um but i i think what they 're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : we are selling it to an existing market . project manager : i dunno i 'm industrial designer : yeah but we 're not putting some there 's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext . marketing : that 's project manager : mm 'kay . marketing : yeah , industrial designer : that 's the problem . marketing : and and , yeah , and and we 're also marketing a product . it 's what i 'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . so so w we ca n't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing project manager : yeah . marketing : because all of a sudden we are gon na have cost overruns . so if we drop if we are gon na choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? project manager : hmm . so if we 're keeping it basic we 're loo loo what we 're looking to sell it basically is it 's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . 'cause we really do n't have anything else there , do we ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i do n't i do n't see it , and to me if i 'm gon na market a product for b for beauty for for design i 'm gon na i 'm gon na try to market it at a much higher price . i need to make it special with a high price tag . i do n't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : i want i want to market it as exclusive . so i would market this product it at eighty-nine euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but but i do n't think we have that flexibility . project manager : but i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard tv so the place uh remote the then the place we 're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high-priced basic remote . does that make sense , huh ? marketing : no i no i i understand what you say , but what i 'm what i 'm , okay we probably need to move along , project manager : yeah we probably should . marketing : but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , project manager : we we 're doing alright for time . marketing : and if i 'm coming in with a with with twenty-five euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am i going to give these people for this ? project manager : yeah . marketing : so that 's just my question , but we can keep talking . project manager : okay . sorry that kinda cut into you there . industrial designer : no just i i would i would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe i 'll come up with more concrete ideas . right now it 's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um user interface : right . i 'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it 's just so confusing to do to use all these functions . where i think the largest portion of the market is just gon na you know they lost their tv remote , they need another one that 'll work with their tv . they want something that looks nice , that that that is n't gon na break when they drop it , that you know that maybe it 's it 's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . i think that 's gon na be where you 're gon na find the biggest , you know , market share . project manager : so we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . is that user interface : i think the more bells and whistles we add , it 's just gon na cut into our into our profits . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : because i think as we as we add costs for things like uh for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , i think you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gon na use that ? maybe five percent , you know , industrial designer : yeah mm . project manager : but we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this . user interface : and how much right . yeah okay . project manager : be a good idea . user interface : i 'm sorry . project manager : uh sorry , i did n't mean to cut in . marketing : yeah . user interface : sorry boss . project manager : i 'm not the boss . okay . marketing : oh p pedro , i just want to say quickly i i would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh . industrial designer : marketing : you know sell uh things come to my mind is uh uh something that 's uh um voice-activated . i know we 're getting into some , i hope , some big money on this thing , but project manager : i think that 's probably a question more for for this guy here , yeah . marketing : is that for over here ? user interface : yeah . well it 's kinda both of us . marketing : okay , alright . project manager : is it ? user interface : us us user interface . project manager : okay . marketing : that 's industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : 'cause uh and i think of voice-activated i think of of how many times i 've i 've lost my my remote and i ca n't find it . so some way that i can i can find my remote by clapping my hands or something user interface : mm-hmm . i was thinking about that . then your lights would go off , though . marketing : uh and and so so um industrial designer : marketing : but this 's just something . i 'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it 's like , what are we gon na put in ? what makes this thing attractive ? and it 's only for televisions . so we everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their v_c_r_s , their d_v_d_s , their their televisions and we 're coming out with one remote for television only . and so to me we have to make this a really special product user interface : yeah . marketing : i i i do n't s i really have to say i do n't see the market niche for this product . at this price i do n't see it yet . i 'm i i go along with this , because this is what we 're given to try to market , but i i do n't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market . industrial designer : but we th that should be design . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : that should be the design basically . user interface : right . industrial designer : i think technology we 'd we we 're not in the price range to do it . we do n't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design . marketing : okay . have to do you have to do it in the box ? industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : okay well , so so that 's up to you then to to make this box in something that 's absolutely extraordinary . industrial designer : project manager : okay . marketing : maybe make it in the form of a gun . we can sell it in united states . project manager : industrial designer : project manager : i have a question uh for you . does any of the um the features that pedro 's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? in terms of making it work or the cost of that or user interface : i do n't i think all these things are pretty standard . i think we 'll be okay . project manager : okay . 'kay . cheers . onto participant four . marketing : well you know for marketing f marketing for me is uh and uh how do i go here ? okay . user interface : mm you can just click . marketing : go go . user interface : no no no marketing : is that right ? user interface : you just get off that . you just click anywhere . marketing : ah-ha . yeah , what for me is it um i d i do n't know what i 'm marketing right now , okay , 'til you spoke and when i wrote this , i do n't know what i 'm marketing . i just know that i i was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers . and so the th the twenty-five euros that we 've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : that 's what we decided here . um so what i did is i i decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . so what we 've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design . we 're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . so that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um so i would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . so i say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : uh innovation i think fits into what we 're talking about here with design . uh cutting edge technology , i do n't think we 're gon na have that , these were ideas i was putting together , um unless we come up with some new age product a as far as the casing is concerned . i i wan na make this thing something that i can identify as special in some way , so maybe we can have some i i talked about environmentally sensitive , uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . i do n't know . these are just thoughts . uh i wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation , that we 're new , we 're aggressive , we 're competitive , we 're we 're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . so to me it 's about selling d uh our identity our corporate identity along with the product . um what i found is that the projected costs are competitive . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : uh we 're kind of in the middle of the market , but what i 'm seeing is that the market is ready for i i identified new technology , but again , because what i see is budget restrictions and limitations , i do n't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . if if we could have a technological something user interface : i have an idea ."
