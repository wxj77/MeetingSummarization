    "query": "<s> what was a level that kirsty would be content with of having schools in red category in wales ?",
    "answer": "huw irranca-davies am : yes , briefly . i only have one final question . we 've talked a lot about early identification ; getting in there and then managing the improvement , this triage approach there , and then getting some grip of it , as well , in doing all of that . but my question now is on what we currently have . i wo n't touch on the primary schools , but let 's just look at secondary schools\u201411 per cent of secondary schools inspected in the last two academic years judged as unsatisfactory , needing urgent improvement . there will always be secondary schools and primary schools that hit moments of crisis for one reason or another , but 11 per cent to me , and to any layperson , would seem unreasonably high . are you\u2014 ? it would be daft to ask you if you 're content . what is a level that you would be content with of having schools in red category in wales ? kirsty williams am : you 're right . schools will need different levels of support at different points , and sometimes , it 's not because of a crisis . so , for instance , in my region , we do have an increase in the number of schools in the amber category . that 's because we 've seen in that particular region a number of headteachers retire because they 've reached retirement age , and there are new headteachers . well , that is a moment of risk in the school\u2014when senior leadership changes . nothing else has changed in that school , but the simple fact that you have a new leader , sometimes in those cases it might be their first headship . that means that that school is going to need a little bit of extra support , so it is n't always just a crisis that needs extra support , there are just general things that happen in the life of a school that could lead to it . but you 're absolutely right\u2014we have a particular challenge in the secondary sector where we have not been able to move individual schools forward at pace . and 11 per cent is not acceptable to me , huw , which is why we have introduced this new pilot to address those schools where , persistently , we have concerns about their ability to move forward . if we 'd have carried on doing the same thing , i suspect we would have just carried on getting the same result\u2014hence the need for a new approach to those schools that are causing concern . steve davies : very briefly , the things we talked about earlier was how we measure the performance of schools , particularly at gcses , with a narrow focus . as was said earlier , some of these are the same groups\u2014they trip in and then they do n't come out . our belief is , from research , that they concentrate on squeezing the pips to get the grades up in some small areas for a period of time , and you can do that by targeting and immersing them . estyn can tick the box to say your grades have got better , but we have n't handled the serious underpinning issues\u2014leadership , teaching and learning , and bringing those together . as the minister said , what does sustainable improvement look like in six , 12 , 18 months ? it is n't just , as important as they are , getting those exam grades up a bit . they 're the fundamental\u2014 . and if they 're all agreed as the indicators at the outset , we 're more likely\u2014 . so it 's multi-agency ; it 's not a little activity , it 's a major strategy ."
