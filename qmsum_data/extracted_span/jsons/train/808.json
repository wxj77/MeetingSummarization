    "query": "<s> what 's user interface 's opinions toward marketing when discussing the transition to new remote control ?",
    "answer": "user interface : so this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price . so , i mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it 's it 's it 's very simple , there 's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . so this is something else we might wan na consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on epinions . it it 's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really i think people want to be able to find the button they 're looking for without even looking at the remote control . and was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but i think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . so if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want . industrial designer : but there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality . user interface : so project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah well we w industrial designer : because the same button is doing too many things . user interface : yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we 're only doing uh a television remote control . um i think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . um industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : i i would if i had my perfect remote control , i 'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they 're just in the way . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : they do n't really do anything . maybe you know i although i do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : um but i think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . um marketing : h i think i think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control should n't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it 's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional industrial designer : it does sampling out of the . project manager :"
