    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion of the occurrence of `` spoon-feeding '' in post-16 education .",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : suzy 's got a supplementary before we go on to talk in detail about universities . suzy davies am : is that okay ? because i just want to go back to this element of spoon-feeding at post 16 , where you said it 's actually very difficult for that to occur , because , obviously , we 're talking about the personal project , and so forth . we heard evidence in one of the schools sessions we did that baccalaureate students were being offered a very short and narrow list of subjects on which they could do their personal project , which actually limited the scope of what they were able to do . and we 've also heard separately\u2014it may have been with the colleges , i ca n't quite remember now\u2014that some students were being told , 'on your personal project , just put in what you did for your gcse-level baccalaureate , and add a few paragraphs . ' i 'm wondering how easy it is to disguise spoon-feeding at post 16 when we 've got two instances there that , to me , suggest it 's more about the convenience of the teachers , who perhaps may not be very enthusiastic about the bac , rather than making sure those children get the best out of the qualification . kirsty williams am : yes . and that would be really disappointing . and , again , if i can use my own personal family experience , my daughter has tried that on with her welsh bac teacher . she 's in a different school from where she did her earlier bac , and she said , 'oh , well , i 'll just rehash my `` votes at 16 '' that i did last year ' , and the welsh bac teacher has said , 'under no circumstances are you to do that\u2014no , that 's not allowed . ' this is about using your individual project , linked to something that maybe you hope to study at university , to get the value out of this qualification , and for you to be able to use this in your personal statement , and potentially in an interview . so , again , i guess what this does is show that there 's a variation , but certainly , where it is being delivered well , then that practice would not be encouraged , because it would be seen to be\u2014 suzy davies am : it 's gaming . kirsty williams am : \u2014denuding the students of the very valuable experience the qualification has to offer ."
