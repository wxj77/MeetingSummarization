    "answer": "mark reckless am : what are those messages on why prospective students should study in wales ? dr david blaney : one of them in particular is relative safety . we know that one of the considerations , particularly for parents of overseas students , is are they going to go to a safe environment , and we know that the perception of international students who study in wales is that this is a comfortable and safe place to be . that 's partly a function of the size of our larger cities\u2014quite a lot smaller than many of the cities in england . so , that 's a key message . being part of a uk system is also an important message there as well . so , we 've got a uk-quality system , a uk degree , and the strength of that brand is available in wales , but it 's available in a way that is safer and more supportive , i think is the messaging that 's coming through ."
