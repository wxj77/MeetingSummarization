    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about the conclusion of experiments and questionnaire for user requirement .",
    "answer": "project manager : so um nice to see you again . uh . so , uh . tod uh for this meeting i will take the notes and do the minutes . uh so we will see our three presentations . um we will start with the uh manager expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . marketing : okay , can i have the laptop over here , or ? project manager : yep . oh , i do n't think so . i think you have to come here . marketing : okay . have to get up . project manager : i dunno . i think it should stay . marketing : excuse me . industrial designer : yeah , that 's it . marketing : okay . project manager : should stay in the square here . marketing : okay . project manager : oh , maybe . marketing : okay , so basically i 'm gon na present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . project manager : oh , you can put it here . oh that 's okay , it 's jus marketing : um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they 'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they do n't like in remote controls . so basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users do n't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they 'd used in the past were ugly . completely ugly . um they they did n't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they 're watching tv . um , that the layout of the remote controls did n't match they way that they used it . um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . and from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control . um and you can see they 're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user 's watching tv . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . and basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh were n't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well . so we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . and fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there 's many buttons and it 's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . um and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . we also asked some users about some specific features that they 'd like to see in the on the remote control . in particular , do they want an lcd d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . project manager : marketing : um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . they want these features , they want these high technology features . industrial designer : marketing : um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . so i guess it depends on where we 're focusing our our market . um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um i think we 're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . that 's my dic that 's my presentation . thank you ."
