    "answer": "suzy davies am : thank you . i 'd like to ask you both , if that 's okay , a little bit about preparedness . but if i could start with higher education , i understand that\u2014i do n't know , it must be about 18 months ago now\u2014ken skates told another committee in this place that there had been nine sector analyses done . presumably , one of those was he , because of the\u2014well , welsh government had a presence , and still does , in brussels , related to higher education . apparently , those have now been superseded by work that 's been done by cardiff university . i do n't know if you 've got any comments on that research , or whether it 's been brought to your attention yet . kirsty williams am : well , suzy , following the vote , i was very keen that we work very closely with colleagues in higher education and further education , to get an understanding from on the ground about the potential impact . so , in terms of preparedness , we started that group in the september , and that work from that group , which includes both he and fe , has been instrumental in helping the government form its views , which were articulated in the government 's white paper , 'securing wales ' future ' . there has been ongoing work being done\u2014as the debate in london and europe becomes a little bit more clear , then it becomes a little less clear , and then a little bit more clear , but , bearing in mind the difficulties of working in an ever-changing field , we have been refining those approaches . each institution has been looking at their own institution , because , as you can imagine , although we have an overview of the sector , the challenges are very different for individual institutions\u2014so their exposure , for instance , to the number of european union students that they have at their college , or the work that they might be doing with horizon 2020 , or their success\u2014and there has been considerable success in the he field in securing structural funds for various projects\u2014the exposure and the potential impact of leaving the eu , in a 'no deal ' or in a 'deal ' scenario , is very , very different . but i do n't know if , huw , you want to talk any further . suzy davies am : maybe just to use the 'no deal ' scenario is probably the easiest , is n't it ? kirsty williams am : the 'no deal ' ? suzy davies am : well , yes , because that 's the worst-case scenario , so let 's look at that one . huw morris : as the cabinet secretary mentioned , the higher education brexit working group's been meeting since september 2016 and has been looking at that in general . more recently , when the prospect of no deal became talked about , officials have been visiting individual institutions to talk to them about their preparedness for that . as you 'll be aware , the funding for much of the activity is secured , we believe , even under a 'no deal ' scenario , until december 2020 ; that 's a letter we had from the chief secretary to the treasury . i think the research you 're referring to may be research that cardiff university has been doing with the bevan foundation and others . i know there 's a report due to be launched later today . we have been doing our own research and looking at the impact on he , fe and apprenticeship providers . suzy davies am : well , that 's really helpful because my understanding was that this cardiff university research had superseded all those nine sector analyses ."
