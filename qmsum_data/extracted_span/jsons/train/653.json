    "answer": "project manager : i think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous . marketing : 'kay . project manager : um the reason i 'm saying that is we 're just looking at a a replacement remote control , something that 's stylish , so maybe you 're even just maybe you 're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying marketing : and it 's stylish . project manager : if they 're buying it that often or they 're maybe looking to replace something then , they 've got a bit of free cash , so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : maybe even single , just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow . although of course i mean at twenty five euros , i do n't think we 're looking at charging the earth for the uh device . marketing : yep . okay ."
