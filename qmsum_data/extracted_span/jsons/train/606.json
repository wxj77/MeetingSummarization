    "answer": "hon . mary ng ( minister of small business , export promotion and international trade ) : thank you , mr . chair . i want to thank the honourable member for that question . we know that at this time canada must show leadership in the face of global challenges . more than ever , canada is playing a positive role by being a champion in diversity and inclusion , supporting the global fight against covid-19 , addressing climate change , leading peace and security efforts and helping the most vulnerable . a seat on the security council will allow canada to be a strong voice for a fairer , more inclusive and prosperous the chair : we 'll go back to mr. barrett . mr. michael barrett : mr . chair , i received a letter from bob anderson this week , who 's advocating for his neighbours like jean grevelding , who owns a cottage at butternut bay . like many people , jean is an american who owns a property on our side of the border . these people are taxpaying members of our communities . these folks have plans in place to follow all canadian quarantine rules . they 're concerned about leaving their properties uncared for over the summer . will folks like jean be allowed to cross the border to check on their properties this summer ? hon . bill blair ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) : thank you very much , mr . chair . of course , our priority is and always has been and always must be the protection of the health and safety of canadians . that 's why we put in place these restrictions for non-essential travel and have required , through the public health agency of canada , a 14-day quarantine . i do n't know the specifics of the person for whom you advocate , but we want to make sure that if they come into canada , it is for an essential purpose and that they do it safely and respect the quarantine that has been put in place . mr. michael barrett : with nine branches throughout my riding , the royal canadian legion offers a great deal to veterans and rural communities alike . they have been experiencing hardship and a loss of revenue , to the point where they may be forced to shut their doors . the zone g2 commander and local mayors such as roger haley have reached out to me expressing their dire need . will the government offer support to legions across the country so they can continue to carry out their vital work for our veterans ? hon . lawrence macaulay ( minister of veterans affairs ) : thank you very much , mr . chair . yes , we have done a lot to help support groups like the legions . there is a $ 350-million emergency community support fund . if they 're supplying any help to people regarding covid , this fund is there . indeed , we 're doing everything we can to make sure that we help the legions and other groups that do so much to help veterans right across the country . mr. michael barrett : on may 21 , the minister stated that her team was working as quickly as it could to fill the gaps in ceba . it has now been three weeks , and many business owners , such as mortgage broker corinna smith-gatcke , are still left in the lurch amid the delays , which are pushing businesses closer to shutting their doors for good . will these businesses have access to ceba before it 's too late for them ? hon . mary ng : thank you , mr . chair , and i thank the honourable member for that really important question on our canadian small businesses . those businesses can absolutely have access to the loan at their financial institution this friday , and i would encourage them to go and see their bank or credit union . i want businesses to know that nothing is more important for us than making sure they get the support they need during this difficult time . mr. michael barrett : the county road 43 expansion project is critical for my riding and the region as a whole . this project will widen the road , increasing safety for the 18,000 motorists who travel the road every day . it 's been 334 days since the provincial and local governments announced funding , but there has been nothing from this liberal government . it 's been 181 days since minister mckenna told me her staff were reviewing the project . today , there is still nothing , and for the last month the minister 's team has not even found the time to respond to my request for an update . will minister mckenna finally stop with the delays and commit to funding this project today ? hon . catherine mckenna ( minister of infrastructure and communities ) : mr . chair , as the member opposite knows , we work with provinces and territories to advance our infrastructure investments . we 're making investments across the country . they are making a real difference in people 's lives . we 're always happy to work with members of parliament , but they must also work with provinces and territories so that projects are advanced by them to our office . the chair : we 'll now continue with mrs. wagantall . mrs. cathay wagantall ( yorktonmelville , cpc ) : thank you , chair . through you , has mr. macaulay read ombudsman dalton 's may 2020 report , financial compensation for canadian veterans : a comparative analysis of benefit regimes ? hon . lawrence macaulay : mr . chair , i apologize , but i 'll have to ask my honourable colleague to repeat the question . the chair : mrs. wagantall , we 'll freeze the time so that there 's no extra time taken . mrs. cathay wagantall : thank you , chair . my question was whether mr. macaulay has read ombudsman dalton 's may 2020 report , financial compensation for canadian veterans : a comparative analysis of benefit regimes . hon . lawrence macaulay : thank you very much , mr . chair . i appreciate my honourable colleague 's question . of course , i appreciate mr. dalton 's input and all that he has done for veterans . we 've discussed it many times . i 've done everything and worked with him in order to make sure that we bring the proper compensation to veterans the chair : we 'll go back to mrs. wagantall . mrs. cathay wagantall : as a result of that study , are the financial outcomes canada seeks to provide for ill and injured veterans now clearly defined within the department of veterans affairs ? hon . lawrence macaulay : mr . chair , as the member would know , i am to bring a report to the veterans affairs committee , and there are a number of things done in order to make sure that report is the chair : we 'll go back to mrs. wagantall . mrs. cathay wagantall : then i would suggest that we get our committee up and going as it should be . where are these financial directions published ? hon . lawrence macaulay : well , of course , lockdown , but just under $ 90 million that the government put in supplementary estimates to make sure we address the backlog for veterans affairs . it 's a major help the chair : we 'll go back to mrs. wagantall . mrs. cathay wagantall : minister , are canadian armed forces members provided with a copy of this document ? hon . lawrence macaulay : mr . chair , my honourable colleague would have to ask the canadian armed forces that question . mrs. cathay wagantall : there are three different providing lifetime benefits for ill and injured veterans . in ombudsman dalton 's recent report , did any one of these three provide the best compensation in all nine scenarios that were studied ? hon . lawrence macaulay : of course , as she knows , there 's been a lot of work done in order to make sure that we provide the proper compensation to veterans . we 're working very hard , with a lot of help from mr. dalton , to make sure that the appropriate the chair : we 'll now continue with mrs. wagantall . mrs. cathay wagantall : in the undisclosed settlement of sean bruyea 's legal case against seamus o'regan and the liberal government , a joint statement says ... canadians , especially all veterans and their families , are encouraged to enter the public debate about policies and programs that affect our veterans and their families . does mr. macaulay agree with this statement ? hon . lawrence macaulay : i can assure you that anybody is welcome to enter any discussion on compensation of veterans . we 're always open to what we can do in order to make sure that we provide appropriate compensation . i do n't think the term would be appropriate , but it would provide some compensation to veterans who truly deserve it . they defend our democracy the chair : we 'll go back to ms. wagantall . oh , i 'm sorry ms. andranne larouche : mr.chair , i have a point of order . the interpretation has n't worked for a few interventions . it 's difficult to follow the exchange between the hon . member and the minister . the chair : we 're having a problem with the interpretation . minister and ms. wagantall , you are joining us virtually . i 'm wondering if you have the right language on at the bottom of your screen . we 'll start with that for troubleshooting . mrs. cathay wagantall : i have english . the chair : very good . minister macaulay , what do you have ? hon . lawrence macaulay : i have english , mr . chair . the chair : very good . then we 'll check on our side . ms.larouche , did i understand correctly that the interpretation did n't work for both speakers ? ms. andranne larouche : the sound did n't allow the interpreters to do their job . it seemed to be a problem with the sound . the chair : in that case , i would ask both members to maybe put their mike a little bit close to their mouth . we 'll see how that works . i 'm looking at the screen , and i notice the mike is a little bit far . could we bend it in a little bit more ? i appreciate that . thank you for your patience . we 'll give it another try . ms. wagantall , please go ahead . mrs. cathay wagantall : on a point of order , quite often while i 'm trying to speak , there are lots of other voices in the background . the chair : i would ask everyone to please be on mute , as well as for anyone in the chamber to please refrain from speaking loudly . just whisper among yourselves if you have something to say . we 'll take this one from the top . we have a minute and 45 seconds left . ms. wagantall , please proceed with your next question . mrs. cathay wagantall : you said next question , so we 're not going backwards , chair ? the chair : did we have an answer from minister macaulay ? no ? we 'll go to minister macaulay to finish up the answer . we 'll start at 27 seconds , freeze the clock and hear his answer . then , because of all of the confusion , we 'll start at one minute and 45 seconds when we get going again . mrs. cathay wagantall : should i repeat the question , sir ? the chair : please do . the clock is frozen . after we go through the question and the answer , we 'll start the clock again . mr. wagantall , please repeat the question . mrs. cathay wagantall : thank you , chair . in the undisclosed settlement to sean bruyea 's legal case against seamus o'regan and the liberal government , a joint statement says , canadians , especially all veterans and their families , are encouraged to enter the public debate about policies and programs that affect our veterans and their families . does mr. macaulay agree with this statement ? hon . lawrence macaulay : mr . chair , i appreciate my honourable colleague 's question and concern . of course i agree . anybody is quite open to indicate whatever they wish in order to make sure we provide as appropriate a compensation as possible . you can never totally compensate veterans truly for what they deserve , but we want to make sure we provide the best compensation possible . that 's what we will do and want to do . the chair : ms. wagantall , we will start the clock again . you have one minute and 45 seconds remaining . please proceed . mrs. cathay wagantall : if that 's the case , is minister macaulay aware of the practice of red-flagging veterans ' files ? hon . lawrence macaulay : mr . chair , i 'm not aware . mrs. cathay wagantall : since the deputy minister has indicated that he runs the department , will the minister ask him for the names of veterans and the dates and the reasons that they are , or have been , red-flagged by vac ? hon . lawrence macaulay : mr . chair , i would certainly ask any veteran or anybody who has a concern to contact my office . i will do anything i can to make sure that the veterans the chair : we 'll go back to ms. wagantall . mrs. cathay wagantall : do the most ill and injured still receive from the pension up to $ 300,000 less for life ? hon . lawrence macaulay : mr . chair , as you know and as the prime minister indicated when the pension for life was put in place , it was stated that if anybody receives lessthe prime minister himself indicated it quite clearlythat must be adjusted . mrs. cathay wagantall : for veterans in similar circumstances , should the date of their application for compensation be a factor in determining whether they 're treated equitably ? hon . lawrence macaulay : yes , of course , the date is when the compensation would start . of course , it 's very important and very appropriate . the chair : now we will proceed to mr. lloyd . mr. dane lloyd ( sturgeon riverparkland , cpc ) : thank you , mr . chair . retired major mark campbell in my riding of sturgeon riverparkland lost both legs in the line of duty in afghanistan . he is an avid sport shooter , but understandably , due to his disability , he is very limited in the kinds of firearms he can use , and all of these firearms have now been banned under the liberal oic . my question to the minister of public safety is this : did their department do a legal analysis and consider the section 15 charter rights of disabled canadians not to be discriminated against when they passed their oic ? hon . bill blair : yes , there was a very thorough analysis done by the justice department to ensure that the prohibitions we put in place were , in fact , charter compliant . let me also say , mr . chair , how important it was that we prohibited weapons that were not designed for sporting purposes at all . in fact , they were designed for soldiers to use in combat . they have no place in a civil society . we have prohibited them , and we believeand this has been echoed by many people across the countrythat this will make canadians safer . mr. dane lloyd : mr . chair , is the minister aware that the ar-15 is the most popular sporting rifle in canada , and is he aware that disabled veterans like major mark campbell are unable to participate in the sport of sport shooting because of his oic ?"
