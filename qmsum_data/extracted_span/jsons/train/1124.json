    "query": "<s> what was the proportion of schools making effective use of the pdg ?",
    "answer": "michelle brown am : thank you . good morning , everyone . you 've reported that the proportion of schools making effective use of the pdg remains around two thirds of secondary and primary schools , meaning that a third are still not using that pdg effectively . why do you think this is ? meilyr rowlands : i think that sort of proportion broadly corresponds to the schools that do n't have particularly good leadership . i think , ultimately , all of these sorts of initiatives come down to strong leadership and effective leadership\u2014that they know how to organise and use those grants effectively . one of the shortcomings that we often identify is evaluation\u2014that money has been spent on a particular way of using the grant , but it has not been evaluated well . so , i think quite a lot of it is to do with generic leadership skills . but those are some of the specific shortcomings to do with evaluation . michelle brown am : are there any patterns by region or type of school in that ? meilyr rowlands : i do n't think there 's any patterns that we 've identified in terms of region . claire morgan : as meilyr said , it 's very strongly linked to leadership capacity . michelle brown am : okay . thank you . what are the most effective uses of pdg , from your point of view ? is there something in particular that you think that schools should be focusing on ?"
