    "answer": "project manager : so um experience with remote control , first ideas . new remote . so i guess we 're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were . industrial designer : yes . project manager : so uh any any thoughts ? industrial designer : um i with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they 're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons . as that is the main function . project manager : okay , so so basically we 're looking for some um we 're looking for a device that is um robust and and therefore uh wo n't get damaged too easily . um we 're looking for a device that is uh what was the other things you said there ? industrial designer : um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible . project manager : easy to use . use . industrial designer : is easy to use and see . project manager : and see . okay . uh . user interface : can i just check ? is this just a television remote ? because a lot of um systems are kind of tv video combined now , or tv d_v_d_ combined . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . so if you 've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote . or is it just a television that we 're supposed to be doing ? project manager : oh i w um basically i 'll get back to you on that . but it seems to me sensible , user interface : project manager : 'cause as you rightly said , there 's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room . marketing : yeah . project manager : and uh user interface : project manager : so a device for for all remotes . industrial designer : sorry , you go . you go . marketing : i 've okay . yeah . um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . 'cause there 's quite often lots and lots . and um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you 're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . so whereas in the past you 'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . so so i do n't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room . industrial designer : user interface : comes to your whistle . project manager : hmm . marketing : that 's that 's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but industrial designer : yeah . user interface : project manager : but is it in a sense it 's r um mutually exclusive . you ca n't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to marketing : yeah . project manager : 'cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it . whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all . marketing : yeah . project manager : and so these are probably mutually exclusive options marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : that uh marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they 're more with handling them , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on . industrial designer : maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote . or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ?"
