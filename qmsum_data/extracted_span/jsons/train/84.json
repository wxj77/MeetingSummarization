    "answer": "hefin david am : yes , but i 'm thinking that the strategic delivery is reviewing the role of the middle tier . so , you know , what do we expect to see from it , notwithstanding the kind of softly , softly approach that you 've already talked about ? steve davies : it was set up , actually , about 18 months ago\u2014just under . it was set up to build collective efficacy , because what people out there are seeing is that there 's a confusion of roles , in what the regions are doing , and it was building that collective efficacy so everyone was behind the wheel . so , they 've been looking at who is doing what for the last 18 months , and exploring and making some changes themselves . it 's not just what they do with government or what they do with each other ; it 's just happened that it 's timely , because one of the key bits of feedback we believe we will get from the organisation for economic co-operation and development is we have had co-construction , we 'd had collective effort , but we need to do more , particularly within the middle tier . this is not controlled by government , it is arm 's length from government , and it 's not their job to get it ready for the new curriculum\u2014that 's a key part of it . this group will have an ongoing role ; it 's not a task and finish group . it does feed back in to the minister but there 's no formal mechanism by which they have to report . hefin david am : okay , that 's very clear . lynne neagle am : okay . i 've got supplementaries from suzy , then si\u00e2n . suzy davies am : okay , thank you ."
