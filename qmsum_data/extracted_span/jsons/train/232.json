    "query": "<s> what did julie morgan think about the communication process through health visitors when talking about parenting issues and teachers ' preparation ?",
    "answer": "hefin david am : okay . with regard to health and the communication of this to parents , we 've heard about the healthy child wales programme , and the fact that it has the opportunity to play a role in raising parents ' awareness . do you think that 's the case ? julie morgan am : i think the healthy child wales programme and the role of the health visitor is absolutely crucial , because , obviously , the health visitor is there right at the beginning . it 's a universal service , and so there will be great opportunity for them to promote positive parenting in a much stronger way than they 're able to do at the moment , because the fact that you have this defence does mean that the professionals are n't able to make it as clear as they want to make it that positive parenting is the way that they 'd like families to go . so , i think this will be a great advantage to health visitors , and , obviously , they support it strongly , because they 're trying to encourage parents not to use physical punishment now , but with their hands slightly tied behind their back , because the defence does exist . hefin david am : that 's great , that 's a good thing , but the concern we 've got is that half the parents across wales are not accessing the healthy child wales programme , and in my community , within the aneurin bevan health board area , 80 per cent of parents are n't accessing the healthy child wales programme . so , are there concerns that , if you rely too much on that process for communication , then parents , particularly in the early years , will be left out ? julie morgan am : we 've got to rely on a range of ways of reaching parents , and i think that there are other times when there is a much higher ratio of children and families seen . but i think we 've had that discussion with the mapping exercise that we 've already mentioned , that we 're going to identify where there are gaps or where we can do more , and that 's where we will identify this . karen cornish : i think as well that that figure relates to one contact point across the whole of the healthy child wales programme , not the healthy child wales programme as a whole . maybe we could come back with some further information about the contacts , because i'm\u2014 . that figure\u2014 lynne neagle am : the percentage relates to the contact at age three and a half , but that is exactly the kind of age when you 'd expect more children to\u2014 . if they were going to be smacked , it would be at that sort of age , would n't it , really ? so , that is a concern for the committee , really , in terms of coverage . karen cornish : i can appreciate that , although i would\u2014 . midwives , health visitors and others working with families would actually be giving those messages , core messages , about setting boundaries , managing behaviour , discipline , positive parenting , right from the very beginning . so , reliance on that single point of contact at that one age point is not necessarily the most appropriate , because i think there 's a period from birth through to , actually , later as well , when those key health messages , those key messages around positive parenting , are and can be given . as the minister said , we will be mapping a lot of this , but we can give you some more advice on that , if that would be helpful , about the types of messages that are given during that period of time ."
