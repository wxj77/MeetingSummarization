    "query": "<s> what did the meeting discuss about the weakness of the act ?",
    "answer": "sian gwenllian am : do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself has n't been strong enough , and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter , rather than through legislation , and that 's why the strengthening is required ? kirsty williams am : certainly , i see the remit letter as a really , really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected government can be clearly stated , communicated to the higher education funding council for wales , and then hefcw use their powers to ensure that that happens . so , certainly , i see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring , as i said , that those national priorities are clearly articulated , and then change happens . sian gwenllian am : has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it 's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes , and is that going to be an element of the new bill ? kirsty williams am : well , certainly , the 2015 act contains numerous provisions that protect universities ' privileges and autonomy . and that 's really important , and those are principles that i am committed to in any legislation that i bring forward . we 'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming bill , but , at the same time , we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy . and i think there are a number of ways in which that can happen . we have a very positive working relationship with the higher education funding council for wales , and i am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector . the remit letters are a really important way in which we can lay out those national priorities . i do n't think there 's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon . sian gwenllian am : i do n't think that 's what hefcw has said in their evidence . they 've said that the bill has been framed in a way where it 's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements . you 're talking about the remit letter ; maybe you need to have that discussion there , but , in terms of the bill itself , you ca n't make them fulfil any national outcomes . should n't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation , because there is public money going into that ? kirsty williams am : well , i do n't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation , because those national priorities , potentially , will change over time . what is really important , and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation , is look to move to a system of outcome agreements . so , there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have , in regulating the sector , and co-ordinating and funding the sector , to create a system of outcome agreements , where those outputs will reflect national priorities , and that 's one of the things that we 've consulted on , and will look to take forward in the new legislation . sian gwenllian am : okay . that 's clear enough . what about private providers ? the act , or the act as it stands , makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity , and that means it 's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the act , even though they can provide higher education in wales . what is your view on this , and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity ? kirsty williams am : okay . so , i think , first of all , it 's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers , and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers ' in the welsh system , as opposed to the english system . and i think that 's a really important distinction to make . so , currently , under the current legislation , unregulated providers can only access welsh government student support if they 're designated on a case-by-case basis . so , we do have a circumstance where\u2014and a process in place , to manage this . so , we have a specific designation policy , which is operated on our behalf by hefcw . only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year , so the scale here is small . three of those were further education colleges . so , when we talk about a private provider , perhaps people would have a view of a private university , but , actually , three of those were fe colleges , which we would all be familiar with . and the three private providers were the centre for alternative technology , the training arm of the church in wales and the newport and district group training association . all three of those are actual charities . so , in order for their courses to be specifically designated , the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are : quality\u2014is what they \u2019 re providing to students of a good quality ; the financial viability of the institution , again , to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn \u2019 t viable ; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry , not to private good\u2014public good . and we are considering how that part of the sector will be regulated in the forthcoming legislation . but , huw , i do n't know if there 's anything else to add ? huw morris : well , just to say that there are a very small number of private providers , as the minister has outlined , and , in comparison with england , where i think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in england , you get a sense of the differences that exist there . and , if you look at what happened over recent years , it has been those small private providers across the uk who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations , with consequences for the students . so , we \u2019 ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they \u2019 re enrolling with are strong and have good quality ."
