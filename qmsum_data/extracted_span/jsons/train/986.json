    "answer": "phd d : while our system is currently at seven percent . um , but what happens also is that if i listen to the , um a re - synthesized version of the speech and i re - synthesized this using a white noise that 's filtered by a lpc , uh , filter professor b : yeah . phd d : um , well , you can argue , that , uh that this is not speech , professor b : yeah . phd d : so the ear is not trained to recognize this . but s actually it sound like whispering , so we are professor b : well , i mean , it 's phd d : eh professor b : there 's two problems there . i mean i mean , so so the first is that by doing lpc - twelve with synthesized speech w like you 're saying , uh , it 's i i you 're you 're adding other degradation . phd d : uh - huh . professor b : right ? so it 's not just the noise but you 're adding in fact some degradation because it 's only an approximation . um , and the second thing is which is m maybe more interesting is that , um , { comment } if you do it with whispered speech , you get this number . what if you had done analysis { comment } re - synthesis and taken the pitch as well ? alright ? so now you put the pitch in . phd d : uh - huh . professor b : what would the percentage be then ? phd d : um professor b : see , that 's the question . so , you see , if it 's if it 's if it 's , uh let 's say it 's back down to one percent again . phd d : uh - huh . professor b : that would say at least for people , having the pitch is really , really important , which would be interesting in itself . um , phd d : uh , yeah . but professor b : if i on the other hand , if it stayed up near five percent , then i 'd say `` boy , lpc n twelve is pretty crummy `` . you know ? phd d : uh - huh . professor b : so i i i 'm not sure i 'm not sure how we can conclude from this anything about that our system is close to the human performance ."
