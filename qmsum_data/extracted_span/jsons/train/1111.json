    "query": "<s> what did industrial designer propose to build a new remote control when discussing the bluetooth technology and the functions of remote control ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : uh yeah yeah , i 'll go , sure . right uh , i 'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . well uh what i did was i dissected uh uh current remote controls and um i viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . and uh after that i put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and i 'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . and i 'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why i think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . um right . uh well what i did was uh i i checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . and the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a tv or uh a stereo or something , and those uh have a transmitter that 's also focused on infrared , so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with bluetooth for instance then uh the tv should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that 's that would n't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us . so that 's probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote . well uh as i mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth well it may be possible , but uh i figured it would n't be possible in within our budget , but that 's not for me to decide , but that 's maybe something for marketing to look into . f because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh bluetooth or or radio waves , although marketing : what do you think about uh incorporating bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the tv , connected to the tv ? industrial designer : yeah , actually i have t marketing : so it 's in the wrong product . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , i actually i figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you 'd still have the uh the infrared function . so in in theory you 'd actually just move the problem , marketing : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : but uh what i did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , user interface : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , i dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be . but it may be uh may be something to explore . uh i 'll i 'll just explain a bit of the components . uh first you have the energy source . the energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere . i figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one . so we did n't and we do n't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that . uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch there is a switch uh between these . when the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , and in uh immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened . that 's uh that 's so the h user wo n't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . or i press button but nothing 's happening on the tv , so is is something wrong or something . so that 's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user . uh w well the signal goes via chip that 's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it 's processed and then it 's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . and those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . uh well my personal preferences here , well we have to keep it simple . not too many uh gadgets and functions , just like you said uh well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use you do n't use them , so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those . uh i i think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . so uh no input from the television . so i think we should n't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that , because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you 'd have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from uh what 's on tv and such . so i figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and marketing : um , yeah , maybe another problem uh , i think current tvs can even send infrared . industrial designer : yes , but what should we uh s i i i f i agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ? 'cause that would be i mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . industrial designer : these all uh all stuff that we have to take in account . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so i i my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . um , well marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we should uh look into the design and the functionability . like i said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh stuff . and uh do n't overbuild , we should n't make a big uh remote control for simple functions , but we we should stick to the basics . so that was my uh my personal opinion . and that was my uh my presentation uh"
