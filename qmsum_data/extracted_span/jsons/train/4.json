    "answer": "user interface : what turnaround time do we have ? 'cause i mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long . project manager : oh but yes it 's it 's very quick , of course . it will uh come back in two weeks , okay , it will be ready in two weeks . industrial designer : works for me . project manager : for evaluation , okay . industrial designer : prototypes , you mean . project manager : yes , the prototype uh prototype product evaluation . industrial designer : in um we probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it . project manager : yes . yes . yes . marketing : well , obviously . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : mm that 'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , project manager : so you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks . marketing : to see get get their user interface : mm-hmm . think minimum two weeks if we 're gon na develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use project manager : yeah . user interface : it 's not a trivial task . project manager : yeah , because we we are not going to do it in uh our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua user interface : no no . we definitely should n't do it in our factory . project manager : yes , yes . industrial designer : project manager : so we 'll do it in the other place , and i do n't think it 's take more than four weeks time . or uh okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then uh it 's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team , okay , uh from the management , then we can launch in the market . hm ? industrial designer : any outstanding ? project manager : s any any other uh questions or uh comments to be discuss ? industrial designer : no , i 'm user interface : what ab industrial designer : go ahead . marketing : i think we pretty much covered everything . project manager : okay , so then uh industrial designer : did you have something ? user interface : well i was just wondering about if we 're gon na do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . project manager : okay uh , let 's take like this . let 's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay . industrial designer : project manager : so no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design . okay ? so we will introduce m this model and uh let 's introduce in the market and let 's take the feedback from the customers , then we can uh go for the industrial designer : second generation . project manager : second generation . user interface : project manager : okay . there 's no end , there 's not limit . industrial designer : user interface : the problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we have n't thought of . project manager : every every custom industrial designer : marketing : well , then it may not be . project manager : okay . well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there 's no end , there 's no limit . marketing : like people do n't like wood . user interface : no , but there 's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we do n't really have anything to back it up . marketing : very specific . project manager : yeah , so that 's the reason you are here for uh the design , okay , i hope you made a good design . user interface : yes , but i 'm not everybody . industrial designer : user interface : i mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . we have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that does n't mean that that 's what 's gon na sell . project manager : yeah , but uh see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like uh you can eat uh you can all eat more chi i can eat more chilli , okay , so i it 's a depends on the individual taste , you know , industrial designer : project manager : so we have we have to balance somewhere . user interface : yeah , of course . i 'm just trying to point out that i think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and industrial designer : our project does n't um project manager : yeah . industrial designer : ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for tv remote control sales ? would it be the christmas season by any chance ? project manager : the sports time . industrial designer : sports season . which sport season ? marketing : right before the eur the world cup . world soccer . world cup soccer , project manager : football . industrial designer : so so user interface : yeah . marketing : they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control . project manager : football . industrial designer : maybe what user interface : industrial designer : so i think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event . marketing : project manager : yes . yes . industrial designer : and and then um user interface : yeah , that 's a good idea . industrial designer : so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because i do n't know when the world cup is , but i 'm sure there 's gon na be one . marketing : or any major sports . industrial designer : or another m major sports event . probably not the um the football games coming up the end of january . i think that might be a little too aggressive um , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but , so , i 'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing project manager : research . industrial designer : pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : or uh perhaps to uh also user interface : that 's actually good place to advertise it too . industrial designer : and to work with motion pictures . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : there might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on d_v_d_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with sony pictures for example . maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : yes , the that of course uh i will convince the management to do that , okay ."
