    "query": "<s> what was the grading system and its fairness ?",
    "answer": "dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . you touched on this once or twice in answers to questions about how rigorous the qualification is . we 've had mixed evidence , i would suggest , from groups of stakeholders . we 've heard people say that the welsh bac has no rigour , that pupils are spoon-fed . we 've heard that the welsh bac is passively marked , the grades are inflated , that there 's little rigour in the sampling and moderation , there 's a confusion about how the scc is graded , and i know that 's something you talked about , actually , that introducing the grading system is improving the rigour . i suppose my question to you is : if the welsh bac is being seen in this way by stakeholders , how are going to address that ? to what extent is that a real problem ? kirsty williams am : i think making it a graded qualification has been really important , and i make no apologies for this qualification being rigorous\u2014no apologies for that at all . that 's how it should be , and that 's how you create value , by ensuring that a qualification is rigorous . what 's really important is that it 's not just me saying that it 's rigorous ; there is an independent process that benchmarks qualifications . the fact is that at advanced level\u2014because i do n't know if you 're making these observations about the pre-16 welsh bac , or whether we 're talking about the advanced level qualification\u2014that is the equivalent of an a-level . it 's been benchmarked against a-levels . it has a ucas tariff associated with it . it is used by universities as a means of qualification that gains entrance into a university in just the same way as an a-level is . so , therefore , i do n't have any concerns about the rigour of the qualification . in terms of spoon-feeding , one of the reasons why universities like the qualification is that it 's very difficult , for instance , in the individual project work to be spoon-fed . it is very demanding of individual students , and it 's very difficult in a way . that 's one of the reasons why it 's valuable , is n't it , because it teaches a different set of skills ? because if you 're doing a traditional , say , history a-level or a science a-level , there 's a very strict syllabus and a course , there 's a textbook and people are taught to that particular syllabus ; with the welsh bac , it is individual students that have to think , for instance , of their own individual project . you ca n't get those off a shelf , and you ca n't necessarily just find that information easily . there 's real skill involved in being able to do that well and get graded well for that . so , i do not have concerns about the rigour . i do have concerns about some of the feedback by qualifications wales about the onerousness of the evaluation and what that means for teacher workload , which is one of the things that qualifications wales is looking at . but in terms of rigour and people being spoon-fed , then i do n't share those concerns . dawn bowden am : okay , because those were concerns , in the main , that were articulated by people delivering the welsh bac\u2014by teachers . so , i suppose the question then comes back to some of the other points that were being raised about the consistency , because that may well be from those teachers in schools where they 're not taking the bac as seriously as some others are . kirsty williams am : and , of course , there would be\u2014 . there is a professional responsibility for those teachers delivering that qualification to ensure that the ethos of that qualification and the skills\u2014 . it would potentially be a disservice to students if that qualification was being delivered in that way . dawn bowden am : and i think what i was trying to do was to highlight the different opinions , because we also heard from teachers who were saying that those involved with teaching and studying understood absolutely its rigour , so it was the mixed message , i guess , i was just trying to test out with you . similarly , on the skills challenge certificate , again we 've heard from various stakeholders about whether , in fact , this is considered to be an equivalent qualification . we 've heard people say that it is different\u2014it 's not the same as an a-level\u2014so , therefore you ca n't absolutely hold it up and say it 's the same as an a-level . it requires different skills , and so on and so forth . so , just your thoughts and views on that , really , as an equivalent qualification . kirsty williams am : it 's not a question of if this is an equivalent qualification ; this is an equivalent qualification . there is a rigorous process that is undertaken to evaluate these qualifications independent of the government , and it 's not a question . is it a different model and a different way of studying ? yes , of course it is , and that 's why we do it . that 's why i want children and young people to do both sets of qualifications , because it does engage and expand the acquisition of knowledge and skills . so , yes , it 's different . is it equivalent ? yes , it is , and that 's why , since the graded qualification came in , it is regarded by independent bodies as an equivalent to an a-level , and it has a tariff for ucas in the same way as a-levels would have tariffs . you only have to speak to the institutes of higher education who use this qualification as a way of setting grades\u2014you know , offers\u2014for students that they see that in the same way as well . lynne neagle am : suzy 's got a supplementary before we go on to talk in detail about universities . suzy davies am : is that okay ? because i just want to go back to this element of spoon-feeding at post 16 , where you said it 's actually very difficult for that to occur , because , obviously , we 're talking about the personal project , and so forth . we heard evidence in one of the schools sessions we did that baccalaureate students were being offered a very short and narrow list of subjects on which they could do their personal project , which actually limited the scope of what they were able to do . and we 've also heard separately\u2014it may have been with the colleges , i ca n't quite remember now\u2014that some students were being told , 'on your personal project , just put in what you did for your gcse-level baccalaureate , and add a few paragraphs . ' i 'm wondering how easy it is to disguise spoon-feeding at post 16 when we 've got two instances there that , to me , suggest it 's more about the convenience of the teachers , who perhaps may not be very enthusiastic about the bac , rather than making sure those children get the best out of the qualification . kirsty williams am : yes . and that would be really disappointing . and , again , if i can use my own personal family experience , my daughter has tried that on with her welsh bac teacher . she 's in a different school from where she did her earlier bac , and she said , 'oh , well , i 'll just rehash my `` votes at 16 '' that i did last year ' , and the welsh bac teacher has said , 'under no circumstances are you to do that\u2014no , that 's not allowed . ' this is about using your individual project , linked to something that maybe you hope to study at university , to get the value out of this qualification , and for you to be able to use this in your personal statement , and potentially in an interview . so , again , i guess what this does is show that there 's a variation , but certainly , where it is being delivered well , then that practice would not be encouraged , because it would be seen to be\u2014 suzy davies am : it 's gaming . kirsty williams am : \u2014denuding the students of the very valuable experience the qualification has to offer . suzy davies am : okay . thank you . cheers . lynne neagle am : okay . just one final question from me . i 've written to you about a young constituent who moved institutions and resat the welsh bac , but was n't able , because of the wjec policy , to obtain a higher grade in it , because they 've got a policy that the grade is capped when you resit it . given what the committee 's been told about the variability in the way this is taught in institutions in wales , do you think it 's fair that young people should n't be able to go and resit it somewhere else and get a better grade ? kirsty williams am : well , given that welsh ministers are independent of the qualification system , i would want to be careful about what i said , because it is for the wjec and qualifications wales to regulate this . but , clearly , we would want to reflect on making sure that students have an opportunity , and a fair opportunity . andrew , i do n't know if you 've got any observations that you 'd like to make . andrew clark : no , not really . i think it 's an individual case , this one\u2014 lynne neagle am : but it could apply to lots of young people , could n't it ? i mean , that 's the point here . i know it 's a constituent 's case and i do n't normally raise those in the chair , but i think , given what we 've learned about variability , it is a valid issue for young people in wales , really ."
