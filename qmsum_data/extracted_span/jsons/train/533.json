    "query": "<s> why did project manager say that money was an important part of the project ?",
    "answer": "project manager : so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about so about finances . so we should target selling price of twenty-five euro for this remote control and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million euros , okay . and we should target the inter an international market . user interface : so could i just ask one question , um is this a stand-alone unit that we 're gon na be selling ? so it 's gon na be you already have a tv but you 're buying an extra remote control for it or something ? project manager : o this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , user interface : okay , alright . project manager : so let 's go to it . so um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go . should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? should it be a universal one ? and uh etcetera . so um so i 'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go . user interface : okay well , so , it seems the the first thing that they 've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wan na make , which seems to a kind of a little strange if we do n't know what the the product is yet , but i guess if that 's if that 's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , i guess we 're gon na need to find out what 's actually you know , what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they 're expecting for twenty-five euro project manager : okay . user interface : because it seems quite a lot for a remote control , project manager : okay i think this is more a job to our user interface : so it 's project manager : market person yeah . industrial designer : marketing person . user interface : yeah ."
