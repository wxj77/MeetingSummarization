    "answer": "postdoc c : that 's that 's right , but you know , thi this brings me to the other f stage of this which i discussed with you earlier today , phd b : yeah . postdoc c : which is the second stage is um , w what to do in terms of the transcribers adjustment of these data . i discussed this with you too . um , the tr so the idea initially was , we would get uh , for the new meetings , so the e edu meetings , that thilo ha has now presegmented all of them for us , on a channel by channel basis . and um , so , i 've assigned i 've i 've assigned them to our transcribers and um , so far i 've discussed it with one , with uh and i had a about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday , we went through uh edu - one , at some extent . and it occurred to me that um that basically what we have in this kind of a format is you could consider it as a staggered mixed file , we had some discussion over the weekend a about at at this other meeting that we were all a at um , about whether the tran the ibm transcribers should hear a single channel audio , or a mixed channel audio . and um , in in a way , by by having this this chunk and then the backchannel after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel . and um , it occurred to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um , um , the the the maximal gain , it 's from the ibm people , may be in long stretches of connected speech . so it 's basically a whole bunch of words which they can really do , because of the continuity within that person 's turn . so , what i 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this , { comment } but but what i 'm thinking is that in the edu meetings , they tend to be driven by a couple of dominant speakers . and , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , then , when when it got s patched together when it comes back from ibm , we can add the backchannels . it seems to me that um , you know , the backchannels per - se would n't be so hard , but then there 's this question of the time @ @ { comment } uh , marking , and whether the beeps would be uh y y y and i 'm not exactly sure how that how that would work with the with the backchannels . and , so um and certainly things that are intrusions of multiple words , taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred , that would be hard . so , m my thought is i i 'm having this transcriber go through the edu - one meeting , and indicate a start time f for each dominant speaker , endpoi end time for each dominant speaker , and the idea that these units would be generated for the dominant speakers , and maybe not for the other channels . grad a : yeah the only , um , disadvantage of that is , then it 's hard to use an automatic method to do that . the advantage is that it 's probably faster to do that than it is to use the automated method and correct it . so . postdoc c : well , it grad a : we 'll just have to see . postdoc c : ok . i think i i think um , you know , the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust the t the boundaries , and all that for all the channels but , you know , that is so time - consuming , and since we have a bottleneck here , we want to get ibm things that are usable s as soon as possible , then this seemed to me it 'd be a way of gett to get them a flood of data , which would be useful when it comes back to us . and um"
