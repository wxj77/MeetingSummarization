    "query": "<s> what did marketing think of technology innovation when presenting the market trend ?",
    "answer": "marketing : um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , i think , creative about it . number two was that it be innovative . okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um quite user friendly while still having technology . so it i 'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that i think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . project manager : aye right . marketing : for example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what i mean , like , or it 's got something else to it that just seems innovative project manager : uh-huh . marketing : because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use . so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? well that 's i guess where we 're gon na go with this . project manager : okay . marketing : okay then there 's the other aspect of the back the the market um research i have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we 've agreed is a priority . uh top european fashion trend um that i read about says there 's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , industrial designer : project manager : marketing : especially in clothes and furniture . and when i first saw that i thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , project manager : okay okay . marketing : do you know what i mean ? so my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . um 'cause i think what we 're in what we 're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um so i think we might wan na be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , project manager :"
