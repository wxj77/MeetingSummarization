'cause we 've we 've brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume . marketing : i 'd say that project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : right . user interface : and then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . project manager : s scrolling through and selecting a few . industrial designer : right . so that 's a one . marketing : so one ? project manager : i think that 's a one . marketing : yeah ? okay . okay um the fourth one . how about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? one of the number one complaints . industrial designer : something that big and that yellow you just do n't lose anymore . project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : whether you want to or not , you 're not gon na lose it . user interface : it 's bright yellow . industrial designer : user interface : bright yellow 's hard to lose . but um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . that , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . that was what we 'd we 'd mentioned . project manager : so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could user interface : just just to use , to find it when it was lost . but like i said , like i do n't think you 'd lose something so yellow so easily . industrial designer : oops . hmm . user interface : and it 's not gon na fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . that 's gon na be a difficult shape to industrial designer : well what project manager : and it is quite bright and user interface : yeah . marketing : user interface : maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? project manager : uh marketing : okay . user interface : i mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , i mean a million ways . project manager : yeah . user interface : you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you 've lost it . marketing : that 's true . project manager : but if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit i think . industrial designer : oh yeah . you probably user interface : yeah . project manager : probably two . you know . if we eliminate the fact that you know it 's impossible to guarantee that it 's not gon na be lost then user interface : yeah . project manager : i 'd say two . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : with the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : y you could add an extra feature actually . which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we could add that but that 's nothing we have thought of so far . project manager : which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a user interface : yeah true . but i mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . they 're cheap . marketing : annoying alarm or something ? project manager : industrial designer : it 's it 's marketing : yeah . user interface : so it ca n't be that industrial designer : um the it 's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , user interface : expensive . project manager : some sort of proximity user interface : yeah . industrial designer : where you have one piece that 's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . that ca n't cost much . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your tv and the other user interface : stick it on the tv . project manager : pray that you do n't accidentally lose that piece . industrial designer : right . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : that 'd be tough then . well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : so . are we adding one of these two features ? industrial designer : let 's add one of those features and say yes . marketing : gon na say okay . project manager : okay . marketing : so we 're back to a one ? or a two ?"
