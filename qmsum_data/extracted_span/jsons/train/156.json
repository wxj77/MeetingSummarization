    "query": "<s> how was the tourism industry in canada being affected , and what was the government ` s implementations to ease the loss ?",
    "answer": "mr. chris d'entremont : yesterday , the minister responsible for tourism , acoa and official languages was happy to close our national tourism week by announcing investments of $ 70 million to offset financial losses in the tourism industry across canada . where 's the big clap ? some hon . members : hear , hear ! mr. chris d'entremont : there you go , give her a clap . more than $ 70 million will be invested to support this sector and promote canadian destinations . southern ontario received $ 30 million , northern ontario received $ 7 million and western canada received $ 3.5 million . there 's nothing for atlantic canada yet . knowing that we just had an announcement from the minister of transport that there will be no cruise ships in atlantic canada or anywhere in canada this year , resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses , where is the program for atlantic canada ? hon . mlanie joly ( minister of economic development and official languages ) : mr . chair , i commend my colleague for his important question . i know he 's a very strong advocate for the tourism sector in atlantic canada , so i want to reassure him . obviously , we want to support the tourism sector in atlantic canada . acoa has a clear direction to do just that . if he has any good ideas , please let him come forward and let 's have a conversation . meanwhile , atlantic canada will also be supported through destination canada . rather than doing marketing internationally , we will be supporting destination marketing organizations across the country , including in atlantic canada , to make sure that we launch this new movement to visit local . mr. chris d'entremont : that would be all great if we were n't in the middle of a pandemic and you ca n't even cross the nova scotia-new brunswick border without having to self-isolate for two weeks . it 's going to make travelling , through the maritimes at least , very difficult . in saint john , new brunswick , 79 cruise ships and more than 270,000 passengers will not be giving back to that local community . at home in nova scotia , it 's about 118 or 130 vessels . in terms of a minimum financial loss , $ 165 million will not be generated . there will be job losses and permanent closures of restaurants and boardwalk shops . prince edward island , which was expected to have a record attendance year , will lose visits of 97 ships and 154,000 passengers , and $ 60 million to the province 's economy will be lost . mr . chair , my question to the minister is this : who is acoa going to be working with , and what kinds of programs are going to be available to help them through this very difficult year ? hon . mlanie joly : i agree with my colleague . the sector is really impacted by the pandemic and the economic crisis . it is a bit like the canary in the coal mine ; it was the first impacted , and definitely it is still impacted . that 's why we are in close contact with tourism leaders and operators across the country . again , recently i had good conversations with the chambers of commerce all across atlantic canada , including hospitality newfoundland and labrador for the tourism sector . there is money for the tourism sector and tourism operators . they can have access to the wage subsidy . they wanted to have access to it until later in the summer , and it has been extended to the end of august . they have access to the rent relief program , the ceba and acoa funding . as mentioned many times in this chamber , mr . chair , if my colleague has clear examples to provide me , let 's work together . let 's make sure the money flows to these people , because they need it . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : you have only about a minute left , mr. d'entremont . mr. chris d'entremont : mr.chair , like the minister , last week , i spoke with simon-pierre poulin , the director of le franco newspaper in alberta , about the sauvons saint-jean movement . he asked me why we could not continue to work on official languages and on modernizing the act even though parliament is sitting in a different configuration . unfortunately , i had to explain to him that many restrictions were associated with the current format of this fake parliament . the pandemic is also threatening the protection of french in minority communities . the liberal government made a commitment to modernize the official languages act in the first six months of its mandate . how will it proceed ? hon . mlanie joly : mr.chair , it goes without saying that our two official languages are important and that , when it comes to language rights , we must always be on guard and protect what we have achieved . as for campus saint-jean , i am very aware of the issue . i had the opportunity to speak with my two counterparts in alberta late friday afternoon to tell them about our concerns and the need to protect the institution from drastic cuts . that was the first point . the second point is the modernization of the official languages act . i have the same concerns as my colleague . clearly , we must continue the conversations and find the right solutions . finally , we must be there to protect our language rights . if the member has good ideas , he can come to me to discuss them . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the hon . member for chicoutimile fjord has the floor . mr. richard martel ( chicoutimile fjord , cpc ) : mr.chair , some people for whom the 15weeks of sickness benefits were not enough before the covid-19crisis now have to exhaust their regular employment insurance benefits before they are entitled to the cerb . today , i would like to know whether they will be able to exhaust their weeks of eligibility for the cerb after october3 . hon . ahmed hussen : mr . chair , we ensured that those who switched over to the canada emergency response benefit would be covered by it , whether they were ei eligible or not . we are committed to supporting all of the workers who have been impacted by the covid-19 pandemic . mr. richard martel : according to a survey conducted by the universit du qubec trois-rivires ' research institute on small and medium size businesses , the saguenaylac-saint-jean region would be the most affected by the economic effects of covid-19 . this is not surprising . in fact , in our region , the tourism industry generates more than $ 300million in economic activity , including $ 58million for the cruise industry alone . the $ 70million that you announced yesterday is a very modest start . what does the government intend to do for the tourism industry in the regions ? hon . mlanie joly : mr.chair , it goes without saying that the tourism industry is indeed very much affected . that is why we are responding to their concerns and worries . we have therefore extended the emergency wage subsidy until the end of august . we are also providing the canada emergency commercial rent assistance , as well as the $ 40,000loans from the canada emergency business account . we have also just announced $ 70million in support for canada 's tourism sector . i am having good talks with various stakeholders in quebec , including martin soucy from the alliance de l'industrie touristique du qubec . in addition , we are going to do our part to support the tourism sector through economic development canada . mr. richard martel : mr.chair , the tourism industry in the saguenaylac-saint-jean region is the sum of all its stakeholders . many of these businesses are too small to receive the assistance announced by the federal government . overly restrictive standards will prevent some tourist accommodation from welcoming guests this year , even though they will have to pay their bills every month . what does the government plan to do to help the regions most affected economically ? hon . mlanie joly : i thank my colleague for his important question . what he is describing is the reason we are currently working on a game plan . we really want to be able to reach these small businesses , of which there are many in saguenaylac-saint-jean , in quebec and across the country . that is why the prime minister and the minister of finance have committed an additional $ 1billion to help those businesses that fall through the cracks . we need to respond now , and i will have more to say about it in the next few days . mr. richard martel : mr.chair , i was very disappointed to see that we had lost asparagus crops due to a labour shortage . when i spoke with the blueberry growers in my area , they told me they were concerned that the same thing could happen to them . some employers to whom we granted summer positions are not finding students to fill them . when will there be incentives to encourage people to work rather than disincentives ? hon . ahmed hussen : mr . chair , we believe that the flexibilities we have introduced to the canada summer jobs program will enable more employers to use it , including more businesses , as well as help young people to acquire the necessary skills and benefits from this really important program . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : mr.martel , you have about a minute left . mr. richard martel : mr.chair , on may19 , the government said that it was studying several solutions to help business owners and entrepreneurs who operate their business using a personal bank account . when will the canada emergency business account be available to them ?"
