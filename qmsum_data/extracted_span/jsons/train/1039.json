    "answer": "marketing : um industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : shall i take your uh power ? project manager : oh sorry . try again . marketing : okay . this is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . so , this means we 're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . so i 'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and i 've made a list of criteria to look at , and so i 'm gon na i 'm gon na leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it 's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and i 'm gon na now use the um the board . okay . so um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . and in fact i hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , user interface : yeah , what about price , is that gon na go on there as well ? price of materials . marketing : like they overlap . mm , yeah , price . we 'll put price up at the top . user interface : not that we actually know anything about it , industrial designer : user interface : but we can we can pretend . marketing : project manager : well we will soon , unfortunately . marketing : um okay , so project manager : come on . marketing : did you say ? project manager : no , . marketing : uh okay , so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? user interface : it depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when i think of fancy , i think of it 's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and which marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i 'd call these quite uh minimalist , industrial designer : yes , a plain , simple , clean design . user interface : simple and plain , but i mean i do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : so in that respect it is quite fancy . marketing : i yeah , so in that respect i think we 'll go with that respect . user interface : i think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , i 'd say maybe aesthetic . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : well we have got s trendy further down , project manager : elegant . industrial designer : but project manager : elegant . marketing : elegant . industrial designer : elegant , i do n't know if i 'd call them elegant . marketing : yeah , no these are n't the exact terms that the um user interface : like stylish or aesthetic . industrial designer : stylish , yeah . marketing : yeah . elegant . we 're gon let 's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is user interface : fancy . marketing : yeah . n that um user interface : did you just break the pen ? project manager : marketing : yeah uh the uh is fancy . so let 's let 's take it to the next level . user interface : well d we 'll just call it fancy then . marketing : well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . we 'll call it e_f_ um , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? should we go with the yellow in terms of i think that 's a really superior user interface : yeah , i think we n we need to marketing : they 're both user interface : they 're both yellow with black buttons , it 's just that we did n't have any more dough to represent uh that , marketing : yeah . user interface : but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . marketing : yeah . user interface : so what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two marketing : yeah . user interface : that is n't that is more curved , like a banana , but that is n't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , marketing : as a banana . i think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we 'll call it the banana . project manager : yeah . marketing : and of the two i really like i m i like the banana , project manager : the chunk . marketing : but i i do like the chunk . user interface : so that 's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it . just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . marketing : but i mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them . unless do you guys wan na evaluate both ? project manager : i think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . industrial designer : yeah , i 'd project manager : it 's more true than false , about a two . marketing : okay . so we say true . technologically innovative . user interface : industrial designer : i d i do n't think that 's what we 're aiming at with this concept . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think we 're using simple components that are gon na be robust but not particularly innovative . marketing : so we 'll say we 'll say uh false . easy to use . industrial designer : very . marketing : one , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : is that inappropriate ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . oh , pardon me . um project manager : trendy . user interface : oh yes . marketing : trendy , s and i say specifically spongy fruity . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it 's no we still have n't decided about specific sponginess or specific industrial designer : we have the worry about how robust it will be if it 's it 's curved as a banana but spongy . i think user interface : yeah , i do n't really think that 's gon na work , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but marketing : okay , so two ? um industrial designer : yeah . project manager : excess buttons . marketing : are there excess buttons ? that is false . industrial designer : so that 's false . marketing : um good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . project manager : better , more intuitive buttons , yes . marketing : true . ugly . user interface : no . marketing : people do n't respond well to ugly . sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people industrial designer : yeah , i think they 're different , are n't they ? user interface : well it is quite it is quite quirky i think . marketing : like oh , project manager : i like it . marketing : yeah . yeah , i do too . user interface : it could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . marketing : oh yeah . and i was i was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it 's cost saving ? with the user interface : oh , we also need tho think about the energy . is it the kinetic energy ? marketing : yeah , with the energy . industrial designer : mm . user interface : if it 's it is gon na be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it is going to be kinetic ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : we 'll c we 'll say it 's a cost saving enviro . yeah , uh so yes . user interface : yeah , but we have n't completely developed that side of it yet , so we 're not completely sure about that , marketing : well user interface : but yeah . marketing : you 're still in the play-doh stage . user interface : yeah . marketing : anything else ? including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? industrial designer : well i think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . we have n't got a lot of expensive components in there . project manager : yes , the instinct says true . marketing : okay . so true one or should i go to two or three ? industrial designer : i 'd put it at one i think , but i dunno , what do you user interface : i would say maybe a two , marketing : okay . user interface : 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . industrial designer : yeah , true , user interface : i mean it 's not just like i mean it 's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res i mean means something different , project manager : yeah , that 's not a cheap thing to get . industrial designer : it might be the yeah , yeah , true . true . user interface : whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you 're in . industrial designer : yeah , that 's a good point . user interface : uh we need somebody to develop that . marketing : um other ? anything else you guys can thing of ? and i 'm gon na actually change a couple of these so then i 'm gon na instead of ugly i 'm gon na say it 's attractive and then make that true , so that user interface : yeah . marketing : 'cause i have to do an average . industrial designer : right . marketing : and then um excess buttons . user interface : just putting no excess buttons . marketing : exactly . wow we 're doing really well . yeah , be you know , user interface : as for marketing : so it does n't ruin the polarity . user interface : see if we 're technologically innovative , i 'd say it is quite innovative , because there are n't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i mean i know we 're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . marketing : or lcd . yeah . well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think i should change the innovative or add other features . if not i 'll average those . project manager : i think we 're good . marketing : okay . mm . project manager : okay . we 're a little over halfway through the meeting"
