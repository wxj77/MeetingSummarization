    "answer": "project manager : okay . so we 've covered that first category , user interface concept , meaning design . user interface : what 's it gon na yeah , what 's it gon na look like . project manager : okay . i ki i kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? it might be the four way scroll , too . i mean if marketing : yeah , it could be whatever , project manager : yeah . marketing : as long as there 's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there 's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle . project manager : yeah . mm-hmm . user interface : well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gon na get wider than your your hands are , marketing : oh , that 's true . user interface : because w and then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? marketing : good point . industrial designer : in the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : which i think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , user interface : yeah . project manager : oh , i see what you mean . industrial designer : that could be particularly useful . project manager : i think so . marketing : so scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? project manager : yeah , i like that . 'kay . marketing : but we definitely if we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled . yeah , industrial designer : well , if it 's just up and down marketing : like on the side of it . oh if it 's just up and down . user interface : but is that for industrial designer : volume or channel . user interface : which ? industrial designer : i do n't know . marketing : well , you could do some on both sides . user interface : do we have both sides ? project manager : can we ? industrial designer : mm yeah . we should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , project manager : so that you 're just not holding it and it changes the chan marketing : yeah . industrial designer : 'cause oth otherwise you 're not just holding it and going like this , you know . marketing : that 's squishy . that 's squishy . user interface : well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . marketing : have buttons . project manager : mm . yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : yeah , that . project manager : hmm . 'kay any other ideas ? user interface : um what colour ? project manager : oh , yeah . latex covers . w industrial designer : we have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we 'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo 's available . user interface : well i sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the r_r_ like that . and that 's at the bottom of it . marketing : yeah . project manager : i think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , user interface : which button ? project manager : i do n't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button , i do n't know , but you know if we 're gon na put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one . are they all gon na have our company logo on them ? every cover ? industrial designer : yeah , i do n't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so i think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea . project manager : if we want it to be visible and um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? but those are plastic , right ? user interface : yeah . project manager : they 're not titanium . user interface : yeah . project manager : i kind of like that look . uh but , or if it was really industrial designer : for our base one ? project manager : yeah , for the base or if we 're going for the retro look , i think , like a really shiny black would be cool . marketing : yeah , project manager : what are your thoughts ? marketing : or like a gun-metal grey , project manager : gun-metal gray . marketing : 'cause then it combines the silver and the black . project manager : there you go , gun-metal gray . user interface : i 'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button . industrial designer : it 'll wear off . user interface : what 's the button marketing : yeah , buttons wear off . user interface : well , w w then what 's the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ? i guess . just looking at examples , y you just do n't ever see the logo on a button , it 's always on the actual casing . project manager : right . industrial designer : there 's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual user interface : project manager : on the back ? user interface : but you do n't marketing : but we want it to be seen . project manager : it d visible user interface : but uh , yeah , you do n't see it . project manager : visibility though marketing : we need it to be seen . project manager : 'cause if it was only on the back really the only time you 're gon na see it is when you drop it or when you 're changing the battery . user interface : well , hang on . the other option is , i do n't know if you can see it but it 's like if project manager : i can find it again . user interface : yeah , it 's like the second to last slide . project manager : okay . and yours was called interface concept ? user interface : interface , yeah . project manager : this one ? user interface : yeah . um . project manager : well , for some reason i ca n't get it to just go to that slide directly . user interface : okay , it 's the very right one . you see at the bottom , it 's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it 's like the top . it does n't necessarily replace the entire top . and so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in . project manager : okay , yes user interface : if c you envisioning it ? and so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that 's the bit that changes . project manager : okay . industrial designer : the only problem is we 're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , so i was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . user interface : yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : like a little cut-out kind of industrial designer : yeah . user interface : right . project manager : okay . user interface : that 's like , you know , a a cellphone it 's like the the screen is always just left opened . marketing : right . user interface : and so , what we are gon na do it like bright yellow with the r_r_ ? marketing : yeah . project manager : anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ? marketing : some of tho well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . well , kind of . um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . user interface : yellow . project manager : yellow , i like that idea . user interface : yeah . marketing : like if we like the one all the way on the left , uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . so we 'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons . user interface : oh , that one . project manager : i like the yellow illumination idea , very good . marketing : yeah ."
