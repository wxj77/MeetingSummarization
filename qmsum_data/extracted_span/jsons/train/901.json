    "answer": "phd c : uh . yeah , we formed a coalition actually . phd e : yeah . almost . phd c : we already made it into one . professor b : oh , good . phd c : yeah . professor b : excellent . phd e : yeah . professor b : that 's the best thing . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : so , tell me about it . phd e : so it 's well , it 's spectral subtraction or wiener filtering , um , depending on if we put if we square the transfer function or not . professor b : right . phd e : and then with over - estimation of the noise , depending on the , uh the snr , with smoothing along time , um , smoothing along frequency . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : it 's very simple , smoothing things . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : and , um , the best result is when we apply this procedure on fft bins , uh , with a wiener filter . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : and there is no noise addition after after that . so it 's good because it 's difficult when we have to add noise to to to find the right level . phd a : are you looking at one in in particular of these two ? phd e : yeah . so the sh it 's the sheet that gives fifty - f three point sixty - six . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : um , the second sheet is abo uh , about the same . it 's the same , um , idea but it 's working on mel bands , and it 's a spectral subtraction instead of wiener filter , and there is also a noise addition after , uh , cleaning up the mel bins . mmm . well , the results are similar . professor b : yeah . i mean , it 's { comment } it 's actually , uh , very similar . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , if you look at databases , uh , the , uh , one that has the smallest smaller overall number is actually better on the finnish and spanish , uh , but it is , uh , worse on the , uh , aurora phd e : it 's worse on professor b : i mean on the , uh , ti - ti - digits , phd e : on the multi - condition in ti - digits . yeah . professor b : uh , uh . um . so , it probably does n't matter that much either way . but , um , when you say u uh , unified do you mean , uh , it 's one piece of software now , or ?"
