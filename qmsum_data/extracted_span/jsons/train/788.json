    "answer": "janet finch-saunders am : okay , thanks . and then , how do you respond to concerns that learners are avoiding studying the welsh bac\u2014 where they can , that is\u2014by attending institutions in england or institutions that do not offer welsh-medium provision ? kirsty williams am : well , it 's interesting , is n't it , about where children choose to study and whether they are motivated by the avoidance of the welsh bac ? people make decisions about where to study for a whole host of reasons , and it 's difficult sometimes to quantify what those are . so , for instance , we often hear this along the border that , because\u2014 . the geography is not easy , but it can be relatively easy to go across into the english system and therefore you do n't have to do this . now , the reasons for that could be very variable . it could be about the nature of the offer . we know that , in some of our rural schools , the secondary sixth forms are n't able to offer a wide variety of a-levels , and perhaps , by going to a different institution , a larger institution across the way , then you can get that combination of the a-levels you want to do , which simply is n't possible if you do it in your home school . or , we do have some consortia arrangements where a-levels are delivered across a wide variety of schools , which require students to travel . some students do n't want to do that ; they do n't want to do their a-levels in three different schools , but they 'd rather go to an institution where they can do it all under one roof . and that means , sometimes , moving across the border or , in the area i live , children making the decision to go to merthyr college , because its a lovely , beautiful new building , the facilities are absolutely fantastic and a wide variety of a-levels is available under one roof . we looked at , in particular , also , the perception of quality . so , if we take the example of king henry viii school in abergavenny , a school where , in the past , there have been , i think , within the community , some concerns about the quality of that school\u2014whether it 's regarded as a good school . and , from that particular location , you can quite easily get to hereford college\u2014a college that has a fantastic offer , does very , very well and has a beautiful building . what we do , if we look at the tracking of the students who have been retained in king henry viii , as that school has been on its improvement journey and has done better and better and better , the number of students that they are retaining into their sixth form has grown . so , the perception is , 'this is a good school , i 'm going to get a good-quality experience here ' , and more and more students are choosing to stay in that school than perhaps make the decision to travel somewhere else . we also have to recognise that , for some students , staying in the sixth form is n't what they want to do ; they want a different experience , they want to go to an fe college . they want a different experience . so , we have to take into consideration that students could be motivated by a wide variety of subjects , and there 's no hard-and-fast evidence that it is avoidance of the bac that is the sole driver for some of these choices . lynne neagle am : si\u00e2n , on this . sian gwenllian am : the evidence that we 've had from one of the teaching unions\u2014robust and clear evidence\u2014is that this is happening , that is , that young people are leaving wales to go over the border to schools in england in order to avoid the welsh bac . that 's exactly what was said to us . but you do n't accept that evidence ."
