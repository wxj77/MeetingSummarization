    "answer": "industrial designer : 'kay , we 've made a prototype . um , we 've got uh uh our aspects from the last meeting . uh , especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . um , we 've uh drawn here the p prototype . the logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control , user interface : industrial designer : but it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher . um , our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . maybe you can uh point them uh the functions . user interface : uh , well the uh all the functions are discussed uh i think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . uh , it 's a little bit . uh , power button . uh then the the the nine uh channels . project manager : user interface : uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . and then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext project manager : oh no , the the the mute button misses now . user interface : i thought that was th marketing : alright , i project manager : do y do you user interface : oh , the mute button . project manager : did we want to have a m mute button ? industrial designer : but uh that marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it 's uh here then , in the middle . user interface : yeah . marketing : alright , and uh you got ta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . industrial designer : yes , um user interface : well , yeah mo uh mo industrial designer : we 've disc user interface : yeah , well most of them are right-handed . industrial designer : most of the users marketing : yeah , but you you got ta make it clear on the on user interface : yeah well , i do n't have time in uh anymore on the industrial designer : yes , y there there will be a p a little a little p_ on that and a little uh yeah . marketing : yeah , and a and a triangle on that . user interface : oh yeah , just progr programme above , i think . marketing : yes . next to that i kinda miss a zero actually . user interface : project manager : wait , there 's was one thing i wanted to ask . marketing : industrial designer : user interface : marketing : industrial designer : project manager : uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like marketing : project manager : uh d i call it teens and twenties . uh , y th th th the two numbers . marketing : all n no , that 's um kinda dependent on the television . user interface : yeah , true , yeah . industrial designer : it 's a television . yes . project manager : yeah , but do we have do we need extra buttons , user interface : uh project manager : for example some uh some have to user interface : uh i think so . marketing : i think industrial designer : yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh marketing : yeah , i think you should add user interface : zero ? marketing : a cross , or whatever . yeah , line . project manager : yeah , but you do n't you do n't actually need them , user interface : may maybe here ? project manager : becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds user interface : yeah . and then a second . marketing : no , that 's dependent on the television . project manager : no , i do n't think so . industrial designer : yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press marketing : i do know so . user interface : is it depending on television ? project manager : nah , i do n't think so really , marketing : yeah . project manager : because you have a i know some remote controls that do n't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . industrial designer : yes , but but a lot uh marketing : yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television . or actually , the other way around . project manager : no , i think uh i really think it 's n marketing : but project manager : because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it 's the same thing as when you just push the one , marketing : yeah . project manager : because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . industrial designer : yes , but marketing : yeah , well but su if industrial designer : some televisions do n't accept uh that that project manager : yeah , because that 's i it 's for television . it 's exact the same thing . industrial designer : no , no , but s marketing : no no no . so some television respond differently . look , if uh i i project manager : no , listen listen . when you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . i in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . marketing : yes . yes , that 's true . project manager : the one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you do n't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . user interface : yeah . true . marketing : no project manager : i think it works that way , really . marketing : no , it it it works uh if you have n't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . project manager : yeah , but it 's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button . industrial designer : yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . project manager : yeah , but you do n't underst uh you do n't understand my point . marketing : yep . true . project manager : i think it 's exact the same thing when y industrial designer : you want yes , but some television do n't support it . project manager : no , but then they would a would also support that button , because it 's the same thing . user interface : but the ex project manager : listen , with that that 's that special but button you 're talking about , eh ? that 's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv tv that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . when you do n't have that separate button , and you push y one , it 's exactly the same thing . do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had marketing : no , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c industrial designer : a remote can project manager : yeah . but you give the input . industrial designer : so they need no , they need project manager : you push the one . that 's the same thing as the button with the one and it marketing : no , that 's not true . project manager : yes it it is . marketing : it 's simply not true . it 's simply not true . project manager : think about it . user interface : yeah . you uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something industrial designer : but uh marketing : uh project manager : and it 's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . marketing : no , remote control does n't give signal after five seconds . remote control is a stupid thing . if you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television . project manager : yeah , that 's true . yeah , but i m uh but it 's i i know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that does n't sport these buttons , it still works . industrial designer : yeah , it project manager : but okay , we we 'll impl marketing : no , definitely not . definitely not . user interface : we 'll discuss them in the usability lab . project manager : no , we 'll apply them then for now . user interface : uh eva evaluation . marketing : user interface : i do n't know uh i do n't know if if it 's it 's necessary . project manager : yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . user interface : yeah ? project manager : yeah , i think so . yeah , for now , if we do n't know for sure whether user interface : okay . industrial designer : and the button for the scart uh audio video uh external input . project manager : yeah but marketing : uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , i guess . project manager : okay . what i said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : but i still think i it it all tvs in some ways support it , i do n't know . i think it 's more c is m maybe we do n't uh we both do n't really understand how it i how it really works , industrial designer : no , no . project manager : but i think there 's more to in than wha than what you just said . industrial designer : uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . project manager : i do think that uh m tvs support mur multiple kind of remote controls . m industrial designer : uh , some n some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten project manager : th wo n't work wi with uh industrial designer : no , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . project manager : to have that special button . industrial designer : when you uh press one button , you give one signal . and the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . but project manager : okay , well we 'll see . industrial designer : when you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . marketing : okay . i kinda miss the docking station . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yes . it 's here on the user interface : marketing : user interface : well it industrial designer : user interface : yeah , uh there 's nothing i think it 's pretty basic , industrial designer : we came uh user interface : the the there 's no fu there 's one there 's one button , marketing : no nothing really trendy about it . user interface : that 's wha there 's there 's there 's one function and that 's n the one button when you want to find it . industrial designer : but maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , marketing : the button . industrial designer : because real real reaction sells more products than only remote controls . so maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh m_p_ three players or or uh uh hearing devices . marketing : i think that 's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . industrial designer : yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it 's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh marketing : yeah , of course . mm-hmm . well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course . industrial designer : yes , but we can make marketing : the technology and the voltage can be the same . that 's uh that 's true . but uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . industrial designer : no , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . marketing : yeah , that 's true , but uh industrial designer : when when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . just have to be big enough for the biggest marketing : yes , but uh i i g should n't it fall then ? it is n't going to fall down ? that 's a bit uh industrial designer : no , when you make it large enough no it it will not . marketing : yeah , i think industrial designer : but then it 's a little bit marketing : no , but if if like this , i 'll i 'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , industrial designer : but it 's just an idea . marketing : i wo n't draw it really . if you got a base which is uh as big as this industrial designer : but it 's flat it 's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this . user interface : you can . but i i i it 's backwards . marketing : yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can industrial designer : yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big user interface : but it 's it 's backwards . it 's leaning . it 's leaning backwards , i think , in the in the docking station . marketing : yeah . uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom user interface : that 's text . marketing : oh , right , help . project manager : but user interface : marketing : uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the industrial designer : yes , little holer littler uh , little products go deeper in it . marketing : yeah . that i that is possible , yep . project manager : well let 's ha let 's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . marketing : yeah , sure , you 're right . industrial designer : yes . and uh uh project manager : but we have to look n i do n't know . industrial designer : the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . marketing : i do n't like the colours . mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so it 's it 's it 's really good design . marketing : yeah . alright . project manager : yes . that 's it ? industrial designer : yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . marketing : the light . okay . and other lights ? project manager : i think added lights are gon na be a problem too . industrial designer : yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . marketing : no , o on the on the front . yeah , okay . maybe the uh the logo . user interface : lights ? industrial designer : but , it will also uh uh use batteries , marketing : yeah , why not ? industrial designer : and do we want to marketing : of course . project manager : okay . for now , uh this is uh is good enough . yeah , what was uh on the marketing : okay . industrial designer : the all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh"
