    "answer": "project manager : uh we just have to see what it looks like . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i would like to make a decision . what it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it project manager : yeah , if you have some financial information that that 'd be nice , industrial designer : and exactly , i need it . project manager : so . hmm . user interface : could you post some other essentials of what people want , so that i can work with some buttons , where to put it project manager : marketing : yeah . user interface : you seem to have information on that , i 'd like to uh see some of it . industrial designer : was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ? project manager : no , it was n't was n't allo user interface : no , it 's not . no . project manager : it was possible , industrial designer : not . project manager : not allowed , so . so that 's um why i 'm not sure that you 're allowed to share documents on the on the draft . marketing : yeah . my computer crashed , industrial designer : yeah , okay . project manager : i do n't care . i have n't heard any complaints yet , user interface : oh , your computer . okay . marketing : i lost my uh presentation , project manager : so . um marketing : but i have the uh user interface : well , i have your powerpoint presentation , i can get some inf information out of that . marketing : yeah , but i here i have the the s the homepage of uh our internet , user interface : let 's see . project manager : yeah , the oh , they inc uh marketing : and here is my project manager : they include the new one . or just for you . user interface : oh , where would we marketing : here is my marketing report , project manager : oh marketing : maybe you ca you can look at uh that project manager : no , i did n't have that . marketing : and user interface : where would we want the uh teletext button ? marketing : ah yeah . user interface : because we decided that it 's n not that important . project manager : all it tells just let 's make make a new marketing : and one user interface : do we put it somewhere over here ? project manager : tick the new one . um other side . yeah , let 's increase it a little because marketing : and uh wha what people want , i 've uh user interface : or maybe this is something for the next meeting , i can draw out some ideas . project manager : yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible marketing : i have another thing uh project manager : just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , user interface : yeah . project manager : so the more less important user interface : well , we have decided more or less the basic structure . project manager : more or less . user interface : i can put the other buttons in project manager : just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down and we 'll see what looks best . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : what uh what did you wan na say ? project manager : or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . marketing : yeah . um user interface : yeah . marketing : uh what i al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost , user interface : maybe another idea uh . marketing : but it it 's also for people , they want to learn it fast , industrial designer : mm . mm . marketing : not uh they want to project manager : yeah , so we do n't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . marketing : it 's yeah , it 's easy to learn user interface : yes , but it should cover all the functions , marketing : wi and uh user interface : so possibly , just an idea that popped in project manager : what we had function that what people do , marketing : um project manager : so . people change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn tv off and on , for example . that 's the basic fu that 's what you do i 'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented . user interface : yeah , but we could go a step further , marketing : and the if user interface : because some tvs have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . project manager : that 's true , but that 's what we stick under the menu button . everything is you say in every tv that 's configured under the menu . user interface : yes , but it because we 're making industrial designer : but that 's the question , is it ? marketing : um industrial designer : because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . project manager : yeah , but industrial designer : if it is n't , then we can not reach it . user interface : we need to adjust to the technology . project manager : but i think most modern tvs have it in their menu . industrial designer : i think so too . i think so too . user interface : true . industrial designer : uh is n't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? if you rule out functions , then uh and that gets known , then people are not gon na buy it . user interface : no , i thi industrial designer : then the consumer bond or something says uh you can not do this and that with it . that 's a bad bad com commercial marketing : if um project manager : uh we 'll we 'll see what we can come up with . industrial designer : for okay . marketing : another thing i want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty . project manager : under forty . yeah ? industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : um on my report , i did n't uh ish i did n't show it in my uh presentation , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : because my computer crashed . project manager : yeah yeah . marketing : um they want to pay for an lcd screen and speech recognition . industrial designer : hmm . hmm . project manager : the want to pay for industrial designer : did they really said it like that ? those two things . marketing : i yeah . yeah , project manager : uh shall we ? industrial designer : do they realise how much that costs ? marketing : and industrial designer : that 's almost undoable . marketing : yeah . project manager : younger , age sixteen and forty five . user interface : oh , we 're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an lcd screen . marketing : uh but project manager : that 's all here , here it says industrial designer : no , that 's that 's . even if i if we have this lost unit , then we can not do it for that price . project manager : yeah , age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . marketing : if if they project manager : okay , so we 're not focusing on this . um all the interest in features , not really the l_c_ oh here . would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . hmm , okay ? industrial designer : yeah , that 's true . user interface : marketing : we can project manager : speech recognition is quite marketing : we can look at the possibilities for an uh lcd and uh project manager : yeah , just look at the possibilities then , marketing : i dunno . project manager : because if marketing : yeah . project manager : apparently it 's what people want , it 's supposed to be a luxurious remote , marketing : how much it will cost and project manager : maybe it 's not even that expensive . or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes . industrial designer : uh i marketing : um user interface : i doubt it , but industrial designer : but i really need finance information . project manager : me too . i mean we all do . marketing : it will come uh industrial designer : we all do . project manager : right . i think it 's something we should put into consideration . apparently it 's what people want , so . we should see if what it costs , if it 's possible . industrial designer : mm . uh . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring , marketing : different colours maybe . industrial designer : hmm . and the design , it should differ . marketing : but all industrial designer : this is philips , huh ? project manager : i have no clue . industrial designer : philips has this . project manager : i just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily . user interface : well , i had basically industrial designer : okay . hmm . uh . user interface : something like this . to make it kind of futuristic . industrial designer : mm . oh , i realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , project manager : i think it 's a very industrial designer : because i need to put all the electronics in it . project manager : sorry ? industrial designer : if we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : because i have to put all the electronics in it . project manager : okay . mm-hmm . yeah , but you have to j just keep in mind it should n't be too heavy . marketing : okay . project manager : i mean we can stick it in in there , i think . huh even if in the worst case we can even user interface : what kind of project manager : could you give me the pen back ? user interface : yeah , sure . project manager : so let 's say that people would want an lcd thing . let 's take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with . i 'll just make it a little bigger now . so a transmitter here . anyway . we could let 's say we have an lcd screen , people want an lcd screen . so then we should probably put it here . marketing : project manager : it does n't have to be really big , but just just have to be has to be there . think it 's a good place , people do n't marketing : if you 're reading from top to bottom , i think it 's better to put it uh at the top . project manager : no ? it 's not that uh it 's not the most important function , industrial designer : me too . marketing : it 's j project manager : it 's just an extra thing , it just you press the buttons on top , marketing : uh . but i if you if you are going to uh put the lcd on it , i think it 's very important to use it , industrial designer : but . project manager : because your finger is on top . marketing : uh because it 's use it uh project manager : how can you use an lcd screen ? marketing : but nee the function of it . so you can use it maximum , because uh it 's a lot it costs a lot . project manager : yeah , but why marketing : so project manager : i i 'm not sure . user interface : now it 's pretty much tucked away in your hand . project manager : uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , industrial designer : hmm . no . project manager : ri i 'm not sure wha i 'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like . user interface : i 'm industrial designer : m i personally would prefer it on the top . project manager : you would prefer it n okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we have three people saying it should be on top . okay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . industrial designer : but it hmm . project manager : anyways . marketing : it 's expensive to build it , project manager : uh this looks a little user interface : i 'm still not convinced of the marketing : you must use the maximum of it . project manager : about the lcds thing . user interface : yeah . project manager : well if it if it 's if it 's possible wi if it 's not too expensive , we should include it , industrial designer : they want it uh . project manager : because it 's it 's cool . industrial designer : we should just try to make that if it 's possible . if it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information . marketing : huh . uh . but uh industrial designer : also keep in mind again , the lcd screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , i do n't know what more and that needs space . so i have to look if that 's possible . marketing : yeah , i know uh . user interface : so basically industrial designer : but if we user interface : can i project manager : uh we have green now uh user interface : what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he would we like to press it in the middle ? project manager : or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom . marketing : in middle of it . in the middle . project manager : maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . i think this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons for example . for up and down , ma make it a circle on it , user interface : yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , project manager : because it marketing : yeah . user interface : because it 's basically the most important function . project manager : i think the channel button should be in the centre . marketing : it 's the most import yeah . project manager : channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . because it 's uh user interface : well , that would make them quite small . project manager : we 're not sure about the size anyway , user interface : so maybe you 'd put them here . project manager : just a general design . you can make it as big as you want . for example if you take uh user interface : yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like . project manager : let 's see . for example just industrial designer : if we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . it is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . project manager : yeah . marketing : . project manager : i do n't think if we if we even use an lcd screen , we need to , definitely . industrial designer : that might be an option . yeah , but if we need two batteries and an lcd screen , that means a lot of space that we need . project manager : yeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is . industrial designer : but it has to be a little bit heavier . project manager : the lcd does n't have to nee does n't need to be very big . industrial designer : okay . marketing : industrial designer : no , but the things behind it . space . project manager : mm let 's see . industrial designer : like a process uh . marketing : finish meeting now . project manager : finish meeting now . marketing : it 's on your computer . project manager : okay , we will . so either user interface : so would we like this or would we like the project manager : we either we have to decide what what people want . industrial designer : i like this one more . project manager : either this one , this this could be the luxurious one . so we have channel buttons here . i 'm just drawing something uh . uh i think this would this would look cool . you could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function 's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here . user interface : let 's see what we have here . marketing : or and uh what about speech recognition uh project manager : well you can just no , i 'm not sure if we can do that , marketing : yeah , yeah , project manager : but we could put a microphone in here for example . marketing : but or or an lcd or an uh speech . i think it 's lcd is better now ."
