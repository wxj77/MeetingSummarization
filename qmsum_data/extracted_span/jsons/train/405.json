    "query": "<s> what was the proposed structure of the belief net .",
    "answer": "professor d : right . grad c : so , and this actually turned out to be pretty key , because having specified sort of these uh this this intermediate level um and sort of noticing that everything that happens here let 's go to our favorite endpoint one is again more or less we have um then the situation nodes contributing to the the endpoint situation node , which contributes to the endpoint and so forth . um i can now sort of draw straight lines from these to here , meaning it g of course goes where the sub - s everything that comes from situation , everything that comes from user goes with the sub - u , and whatever we specify for the so - called `` keith node `` , or the discourse , what comes from the um parser , construction parser , um will contribute to the d and the ontology to the sub - o node . and um one just s sort of has to watch which also final decision node so it does n't make sense t to figure out whether he wants to enter , view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place . but this makes the design thing fairly simple . and um now all w that 's left to do then is the cpg 's , the conditional probabilities , for the likelihood of a person having enough money , actually wanting to go a place if it costs , you know this or that . and um ok . and once um bhaskara has finished his classwork that 's where we 're gon na end up doing . you get involved in that process too . and um and for now uh the the question is `` how much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our data collection ? `` so um , one could sort of think of you know we could call the z see or you know , people who visit the zoo we could s call it `` visit the zoo tomorrow `` , so we have an intention of seeing something , but not now but later . professor d : right . yeah . yeah , so let 's s uh s see i th i think that from one point of view , uh , um , all these places are the same , so that d d that , um in terms of the linguistics and stuff , there may be a few different kinds of places , so i th i it seems to me that we ought to decide you know , what things are k are actually going to matter to us . and um , so the zoo , and the university and the castle , et cetera . um are all big - ish things that um you know have different parts to them , and one of them might be fine . grad c : hmm . hmm , hmm . yeah the the reason why we did it that way , as a as a reminder , is uh no person is gon na do all of them . professor d : and grad c : they 're just gon na select u um , according to their preferences . professor d : yeah , yeah . grad c : `` ah , yeah , i usually visit zoos , or i usually visit castles , or i usually `` and then you pick that one . professor d : right , no no , but but s th point is to to y to build a system that 's got everything in it that might happen you do one thing . undergrad e : they 're redundant . professor d : t to build a system that um had the most data on a relatively confined set of things , you do something else . and the speech people , for example , are gon na do better if they if things come up uh repeatedly . now , of course , if everybody says exactly the same thing then it 's not interesting . so , all i 'm saying is i th there 's there 's a kind of question of what we 're trying t to accomplish . and i think my temptation for the data gathering would be to uh , you know and each person is only gon na do it once , so you do n't have to worry about them being bored , so if if it 's one service , one luxury item , you know , one big - ish place , and so forth and so on , um then my guess is that that the data is going to be easier to handle . now of course you have this i guess possible danger that somehow there 're certain constructions that people use uh when talking about a museum that they would n't talk about with a university and stuff , um but i guess i 'm i uh m my temptation is to go for simpler . you know , less variation . but i do n't know what other people think about this in terms of grad b : so i do n't exactly understand professor d : uh grad b : like i i i guess we 're trying to limit the detail of our ontology or types of places that someone could go , right ? but who is it that has to care about this , or what component of the system ? professor d : oh , well , uh th i think there are two places where it comes up . one is uh in the th these people who are gon na take this and and try to do speech with it . grad b : mm - hmm . professor d : uh lots of pronunciations of th of the same thing are going to give you better data than l you know , a few pronunciations of lots more things . that 's one . grad b : so we would rather just ask uh have a bunch of people talk about the zoo , uh and assume that that will that the constructions that they use there will give us everything we need to know about these sort of zoo , castle , whatever type things , these bigger places . professor d : bigger y yeah thi well this is a question for grad b : and that way you get the speech data of people saying `` zoo `` over and over again or whatever too . professor d : yeah . yeah . yeah . so this is a question for you , grad b : mm - hmm . professor d : and , you know , if we if we do , and we probably will , actually try to uh build a prototype , uh probably we could get by with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway . so , um"
