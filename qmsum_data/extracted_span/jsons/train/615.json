    "answer": "industrial designer : project manager : good morning everybody . industrial designer : good morning . project manager : user interface : good morning . marketing : good morning . project manager : so , we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television . and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . so people can can use it without any any problem . user interface : project manager : . industrial designer : project manager : i do n't know . industrial designer : project manager : user interface : industrial designer : well , i think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh user interface : mm . b did you send us an email about this ? project manager : uh , not yet , user interface : industrial designer : project manager : but if you want user interface : yeah , we we received an email about this uh d designs . project manager : do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer : user interface : ah it 's okay . project manager : or industrial designer : marketing : or you can put it in the shared folder . user interface : yeah , you see the email ? you email . the v very no , no the first one . marketing : no , i did n't get it . user interface : it 's inside . project manager : uh marketing : this one . user interface : no , no . the third one . oh , you did n't get anything . marketing : no , . user interface : it 's strange . mm . project manager : . user interface : i got an email about the dis about the discussion . yeah . project manager : you get email , . user interface : i dunno from who . industrial designer : yeah , from the account manager . marketing : user interface : from the account manager . you have received the same email , right ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : i think it 's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , i think so . user interface : yeah , so each of us has a role to do . marketing : i think assign your uh roles . user interface : in each project manager : for each for each one . user interface : we already have our role . marketing : for each person , yeah . user interface : 'kay , we can project manager : so there are so we have three user interface : so there are three kinds of designs , that 's all . project manager : f yeah . we have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design . user interface : okay , alright . project manager : so , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? any any volunteer ? industrial designer : i think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface : yeah , yeah . i 'm doing the interface . project manager : you are doing th industrial designer : no , i 'm doing the interface . project manager : . user interface : are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer : yeah i i 'm i 'm well , maybe we have okay so i industrial design . it was a little confusion about my uh project manager : user interface : ah industrial designer : but it 's alright . project manager : okay , i 'll for industrial design . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . and and you norman ? user interface : mm ? um working on i . user interface . industrial designer : user . project manager : and and marketing : uh , i 'm into marketing . project manager : doing the marketing . marketing : yeah nothing much in the project . project manager : nothing related here to the marketing : marketing in this design . a design is basically for industrial design and the user interface . project manager : user interface : you see the second mail ? yeah , it 's inside . go down . appendix . marketing : yeah , this is . user interface : see there 's a role for everybody . marketing : yeah , that 's right , user interface : even for the marketing . marketing : first . us user define . project manager : next . user interface : but look at your role , your marketing role . marketing : there 's a trend watching . project manager : i do n't know . user interface : yeah , that 's your role . project manager : i . industrial designer : well , i think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager : industrial designer : and what are your ideas about the project manager : about the design or maybe we 'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer : well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for tv distribution i guess . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : how we can make it work . marketing : i mean working remotes we already have . this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls . industrial designer : project manager : what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . industrial designer : yeah , i dunno i project manager : and of course it should not be very costly . marketing : yeah , that 's right . project manager : so industrial designer : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : well i i think that norman and i would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface : need to collect information . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : about the about what ? user interface : um . i i 'm part of design , perhaps . uh , what is most important in a in a remote control ? what is the most important function aspect ? uh . project manager : you mean the external or industrial designer : well , you have to make it work . project manager : yeah of g of course . user interface : that 's alright . industrial designer : that 's the that 's the big thing . project manager : user interface : yeah , it should be easy to work with . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we can think about an interface with uh well user interface : uh . we maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . you just tell the television i want which channel . project manager : you wo n't user interface : or or you can say for example , um i want uh to list all the programme tonight . y you know , instead of uh remote control it 's doing the some searching for you , so you do n't have to look for the channel you want . just say maybe i just want to press i wan na have a button for all the movies tonight . or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight . and then you list a few , and i will choose from the list . so instead of pressing the channel number , i am choosing the programmes directly . yeah , that 's one way of uh making it useful . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . project manager : i i think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface : no , because no , project manager : s user interface : it 's not very a lot . th this information exists . for example you can get um project manager : like s uh you you you say we can use speech . user interface : you can use uh well for example anything . the the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it 's more natural . yeah . industrial designer : i i think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh i dunno marketing : i 'm a okay . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : i mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager : in the hand . marketing : and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : if we are going to add a speech interface , i 'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface : yeah . yes , possible . marketing : if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that i think the tv itself could have it . user interface : yeah . but industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and i could talk to the tv television itself . project manager : except if if you are far from the tv . marketing : i need not have an user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : i mean we have some or something , different technology but project manager : this is it 's user interface : yeah , yeah . but th the main idea i wanted to s i wanted to say is that um there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch tv channel , there 's a option you can choose , either tv channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer : on the content . marketing : mm-hmm , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , yeah it 's it 's a good idea it 's a good idea project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so it 's more powerful . yeah . industrial designer : but i i think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface : no . no , because you see now all the tv programmes are available on the webs . they they are they are they are available in x_m_l_ format or whatever the format . we do n't care . we just say that this are some content . we just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . some of the websites they already provide this service , industrial designer : yeah yeah . user interface : so we can just use the service available . download it uh to the to this remote control . and then there 's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . the most there are only seven buttons . so i just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you do n't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . project manager : yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : well i i i i think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager : this is good idea . user interface : yeah . ah , yes . so . yeah . yeah , so you do n't have to display here , just display on the tv screen , right ? industrial designer : yeah in the dis display on the tv screen user interface : good idea . okay . industrial designer : and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface : i think i think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager : industrial designer : user interface : because all the tv uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . yeah . alright . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . so i think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface : okay . project manager : so we have five minutes to user interface : ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager : ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer : user interface : five minutes . marketing : and another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface : okay . okay . marketing : so , i mean , if you 're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : the lighting in the room changes . industrial designer : user interface : yeah , but we are designing just remote control . project manager : you it . marketing : i mean , we have a option in the remote control . if we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote . user interface : okay . industrial designer : oh right so user interface : okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager : yeah . if if you you you can if you want you can use th the . industrial designer : please , norman , draw uh user interface : go on , draw something . mm . marketing : oh , i 'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel . user interface : where is it ? marketing : the lapel . project manager : or before the before the the design that says . user interface : ah , okay . industrial designer : user interface : where where is it ? here . marketing : yeah , that one . project manager : norman . marketing : just plug it . yeah , that 's right . project manager : be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the . yeah . user interface : okay , alright . so so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . right ? we agree on that , right ? industrial designer : okay . project manager : okay . user interface : uh , uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons . uh to choose uh content s or channels . project manager : yeah . user interface : so we have both . the user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer : yeah , by content or by channel , user interface : by content or by channel . industrial designer : it 's a good idea . user interface : choose by contents or by channels . and then what did we say just now ? other than this . industrial designer : and uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents . user interface : okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : challenge . industrial designer : i think i it 's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it 's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface : okay . content . okay , so these we have to work it out . so this one of the problem . and uh industrial designer : i think that 's the the things to do user interface : the main thing . industrial designer : and uh to uh reflect about it user interface : okay . alright . alright , okay . industrial designer : and uh discuss it in the next meeting . user interface : so we are we 'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer ? that 's the first aspect . right . we will get information and then we 'll come back in . . industrial designer : okay . thank you everybody . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah , we 'll come . project manager : so maybe we 'll meet in maybe five minutes ? and we 'll discuss the other other aspects . user interface : alright . alright , okay . industrial designer : okay . project manager : okay . well thank you all ."
