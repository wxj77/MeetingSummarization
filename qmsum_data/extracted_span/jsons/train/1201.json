    "answer": "grad a : yeah . professor b : and and uh also it 's still true that uh i think it 's true that that we we at least got fairly consistent i improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features rather than uh in sequence which was was your suggestion and that that that seems to have been borne out . phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : the fact that none of these are are you know , enormous is is is not too surprising most improvements are n't enormous and uh phd c : yeah . professor b : some of them are but uh i mean you have something really really wrong and you fix it you can get big and really enormous improvements phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : but uh um cuz our best improvements over the years that we 've gotten from finding bugs , but anyway ok well i i think i see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about or or are we done ? phd c : mm - hmm . i think it 's ok um . we so basically we will i think we 'll try to to focus on these three architectures and and perhaps i was thinking also a fourth one with just just a single klt because we did not really test that professor b : uh - huh . phd c : removing all these klt 's and putting one single klt at the end . professor b : yeah , i mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it . phd c : yeah . professor b : uh if you can fit it in . phd c : mm - hmm ."
