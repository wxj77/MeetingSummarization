    "answer": "lynne neagle am : thank you . we 're going to move on to explore some of the issues around social services now with questions from dawn bowden . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . morning , minister . when the association of directors of social services cymru came in , they were saying to us that they would encourage people to report any instances , anything that they see around somebody smacking a child . that leads on to the question about whether in fact social services , then , would change their thresholds for intervention if there were more cases being referred to them . are you fairly confident , are you certain , that that would n't happen , or do you think there is a danger that social services might actually say , 'well , actually , if we 're getting all these referrals , we need to think again about when and if we intervene ' , and the thresholds could become a bit lower ? julie morgan am : well , as you know , social services already receive and investigate reports of children being physically punished\u2014any sort of range of physical punishment\u2014and they use standard procedures to determine how to proceed , but that 's done on a case-by-case basis ; it 's made on the individual case element . and , of course , there is a distinction between reasonable punishment and child neglect or abuse . and if this legislation is enacted , a significant proportion of the incidents of physical punishment will not require any response under the child protection procedures , and we do not expect the threshold of significant harm to change . and i know you took evidence from the adss , and i know sally jenkins gave evidence , who is one of the lead practitioners , and i understood she said : 'in terms of thresholds for children 's services , we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us . there may be a small number of referrals that come through . what we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle . we recognise that 's likely to happen . ' so , i think\u2014 dawn bowden am : so , it 's the threshold for intervention that 's the key , really , is n't it , rather than\u2014 ? julie morgan am : yes , they do n't see that changing . dawn bowden am : so , they do n't see that changing . julie morgan am : no , no . and we do n't see that changing . dawn bowden am : okay , that 's fine . the police , when they came in to give evidence , talked about the need for the multi-agency safeguarding hubs . and what we also heard is that it 's a bit inconsistent across the country . and i think you acknowledged that as well . do you think the implementation of the bill , and its effectiveness , is going to be dependent on us having consistently effective multi-agency safeguarding hubs right the way across the country ? julie morgan am : no . the effective implementation of the bill does not depend on mashs , as we call them for short , because bodies , social services , already work closely with the police on a day-to-day basis , really , and they have indicated their willingness to do so , and there are already well-established mechanisms in place that enable this joint working to take place . i know that the mashs are only in certain areas , and i know that it's\u2014 . i think they 're probably very good to have , actually , and very good to help the work , but it 's certainly not dependent on them . dawn bowden am : okay , but it would be something that you would be wanting to see developed , that eventually we would have these mashs right across the country ? julie morgan am : at the moment , there are three mashs in the south wales police force , and one pilot mash in the gwent police force , but they do n't operate in exactly the same way . and i know that other areas have considered having mashs , but have n't actually brought any in . and a multi-agency strategic group , which is led by south wales police , has been set up , and it will consider the effectiveness of mash arrangements in wales , so it 's very possible there will be more mashs , but i want to reiterate that we 're not dependent on mashs in order to have the close working . but they 're welcome\u2014very welcome . dawn bowden am : yes , because the key point from the police 's point of view , i think , was that they provide a single point of contact , so it 's very simple , is n't it ? it 's a single point of contact , and i think they were quite concerned that having that single point of contact might actually reduce the level of unnecessary police prosecutions\u2014well , the police do n't prosecute , but charges and so on . so , it was just a point that they were raising . julie morgan am : i think they are very effective and very much to be welcomed , but it 's certainly not essential . dawn bowden am : sorry , karen . karen cornish : i was just going to say that it 's probably worth saying that looking at how agencies work together will be one of the things , again , that will be looked at very carefully on the task and finish group , looking at processes and procedures . we 're very alert to the fact that there are different organisations , different services , and that bringing them together , working in as consistent a way as possible , is really , really important . as the minister has said , social services , the police and others are already committed to working together , and , actually , we just want to make sure that we develop those working practices in the best way possible , recognising that not every area will have a mash , and reiterating , again , what the deputy minister has said\u2014that the effectiveness of the bill is not predicated on a mash in every area , but it is important that all those organisations do work together in a consistent and appropriate way . dawn bowden am : okay , that 's fine . thank you very much . the other response that we 've received is from social workers . and they 've talked about the fact that the social worker 's workload is already very stretched , and you 'll be aware of that , minister . and i think they were getting a little bit concerned about whether a whole raft of new cases are going to land on what is an already extremely heavy workload , and how effectively they could deal with that . would you say that those concerns , in terms of the impact of this bill , are unfounded , or are we just saying that this is an unknown quantity at this stage , and we 're going to have to wait and see ? julie morgan am : well , first of all , if i can just pay tribute to the work that social workers do . dawn bowden am : yes , absolutely . julie morgan am : because , obviously , they \u2019 re going to be essential to the successful implementation of this bill . i was a social worker myself , so i \u2019 m very happy to pay tribute to them . [ laughter . ] but they do do a hard job , which isn \u2019 t always recognised , i think , by the public . so , i do take this point very seriously , but , obviously , the professionals who have given evidence\u2014many of them have said they don \u2019 t see there being a big rise of referrals . jane randall , national independent safeguarding board\u2014i think she came to you\u2014said : 'there 's no expectation that there 's going to be a huge increase in the number of referrals\u2026i think it would be dealt with within their existing resources . ' i mean , there may be an increase in reporting of incidents , initially , maybe from individuals in the community and organisations such as schools . and i think it could have an impact on the initial stages of social services activity , which i think others\u2014i think sally jenkins said that maybe there \u2019 d be an increase , a small increase , at the beginning . but as we expect the awareness raising and the ongoing support that we \u2019 ll be giving to parents\u2014we do feel that the incidents of physical punishment will be falling over time . and we don \u2019 t really see that there will be an increase . but i know that social workers are stretched , and are hard-pressed\u2014and i think that was some of the evidence given to you by the british association of social workers . but i think it \u2019 s important to remember that they are also very strongly in support of us carrying out this legislation . but it is important to look at the realities and the practicalities . so , we \u2019 re going to work very closely with social services\u2014obviously , key members of our implementation group\u2014and we will collect relevant data for a period before the actual implementation , in order to get a baseline . we want a baseline , and we are working with a small number of social services to try to get the baseline of where it is , and to see what happens when the bill is implemented . the evidence from other countries is that they certainly have not been overwhelmed . there have been reports in new zealand that they have not been overwhelmed , and i mentioned ireland earlier . so , i don \u2019 t think , really , we have to fear that social services would be overwhelmed , but we must be prepared , and we must get this data and monitor it closely . dawn bowden am : keep it monitored . and i guess things will level out in due course . and social services clearly having to make judgments every day\u2014they will be making those judgments quite quickly and turning them around . the children and family court advisory and support service , when they spoke to us , also had\u2014there was a similar kind of concern raised . they did say that they felt that they probably did have adequate resources to support the bill . but do you think there is any danger at all that it could divert cafcass staff , if we have a high volume of reporting , particularly given that we \u2019 ve got a 26-week limit in which to deal with those cases ? is that something that causes you any concern at this stage ? julie morgan am : well , cafcass are confident that they can deal with the cases that they have . as you know , there 's been a big increase in the numbers that cafcass is dealing with already , and they have managed to very successfully cope with the demand . so , i 've got every confidence that they will be able to cope with it . dawn bowden am : because they were basically just saying that it 's unpredictable at this stage , were n't they , so\u2014 ? julie morgan am : yes . it is unpredictable . our best views are that it will not\u2014 . dawn bowden am : yes , because they were talking about the fact that no assessment had been made about the risk of malicious reporting . we talked about that in a number of sessions with the police and so on . so , i think their biggest concern was more about the rise in looked-after children and the impact on that in terms of their workload , and it was just a question of whether this would potentially divert any resources , i guess . julie morgan am : i think , in terms of the malicious reporting , obviously that is something that happens a lot now and it is is likely that , perhaps\u2014 . i think they felt that , in existing cases , this might be another element that should be brought in , but they seemed , in my discussions , fairly confident . i know they appeared before the committee , and they are coping very well . but , obviously , another area we are very concerned about is the rise in the number of looked-after children , and that 's somewhere we want to try to do what we can to bring that down . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . just before suzy comes in with a supplementary\u2014cafcass did n't come to the committee , they 've submitted\u2014 julie morgan am : they sent a letter\u2014that 's right . yes , sorry about that . suzy davies am : just very quickly , because i do n't want to spend a lot of time on this : is n't it going to be true that any increase in workload for social services or schools or whoever is going to depend on reporting rising ? where do you see the likely rise in reporting taking place ? will it be members of the public or is it going to be professionals who feel that this is something that they ca n't ignore from now on ? julie morgan am : well , i think it would be mixed . i do n't have any view or where it particularly would come from , because if there are any reports that go into agencies now about children being physically punished in any way\u2014i think they investigate those already now . but i suppose members of the public might report if they see any physical punishment going on . they would be made much more aware , we hope , by the legislation\u2014so , that may happen . but i think , in schools , if there is physical punishment reported by a child , the schools would report it in any case . but i think it 's likely that there will be a small rise . suzy davies am : i was just curious about where you thought the main source would be\u2014 julie morgan am : i ca n't really be definitive about that . suzy davies am : okay , thank you ."
