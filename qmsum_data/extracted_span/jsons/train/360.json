    "answer": "industrial designer : okay , um i wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . it 's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . um well so it basically works uh as i uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . uh when you press a button , uh that 's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a project manager : sorry . user interface : industrial designer : on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh gives the chips , uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . uh senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . um uh the the chip uh makes a morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let . you know what a let is ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . and that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . that 's basically uh how it works . um the findings uh uh that i found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it 's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh and chips . user interface : industrial designer : uh and the technology 's already available , we do n't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals . uh i made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works . user interface : oh right . marketing : animation . user interface : industrial designer : we tel user interface : there is something turning . industrial designer : there . project manager : yeah , it 's a little bug it 's in the in the smart board . industrial designer : okay . uh well user interface : industrial designer : the sub-component , i suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it 's the button . uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh li uh a d ad uh electronic uh user interface : marketing : infrared light . industrial designer : yes , uh , okay . um w after it 's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set . okay . s uh i wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you do n't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it 's it 's very light to uh to make uh to use it . uh i personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . but i suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . user interface : yeah , i 've got it there too . industrial designer : and it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , marketing : industrial designer : uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . and uh well as i said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay , well , that 's my contribution to this meeting , and uh marketing : to this meeting . project manager : okay , thank you . user interface : industrial designer : two of these this meeting . so . user interface : shall i go uh next ? 'kay . project manager : please . marketing : smoking . user interface : well uh , my name 's , and i looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . uh i did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that i found . um well what i found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . and this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play c_d_ if you use it your c_d_ player the remote control will that one . there are some uh examples of remote controls . you can see they are very different . the one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . and the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . and uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . um i guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they do n't think it 's usable they wo n't uh buy it . a lot of buttons they may think from i do n't need s as much as that . uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . but uh keep in mind the new functions of tv what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? because all the tvs will have them . or because of only a few and is n't really necessary . and then uh make it i would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . if you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . the shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you do n't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . and it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . and that is my presentation . project manager : okay , thank you . industrial designer : okay . marketing : 'kay . check . industrial designer : user interface : you must still have it open . marketing : kijke 'kay , so . we 're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just yeah , and the users , actually . industrial designer : marketing : the methods i i prefer is we 're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? and then tho that section we 're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . okay . some data . younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like lcd screens , speech recognition e etcetera . and we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . the elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that 's two fifth , of the market share in that area . goed so . project manager : marketing : 'kay . findings . fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : so we do n't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you do n't lose it that much anymore . seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or should n't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . next . important issues about the remote . i think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . the volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . and have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . it has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . my colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s uh senden user interface : marketing : okay . so uh if that 's k uh if that 's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . buttons . like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in lcd screen . lcd screen is easy because we have the lcd screen , we have the various options . put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . and you do n't see the buttons . so lcd screens should be easy , but an lcd screen , the problem with the l_ sc lcd screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years do n't use the lcd screen a lot . so we have to that keep that in mind that if you 're going to implement lcd screen , you do n't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . industrial designer : uh lcd screen as in uh touch screen ? marketing : yeah , touch screen , yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : the last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . and the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : so we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . and on my personal preferences , i do n't have any mo more time to come with that , user interface : marketing : but like i said , lcd screen is easily to use industrial designer : marketing : because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . and it should be easy to use . especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . and that is it . project manager : okay , industrial designer : okay . project manager : thank you . user interface : oh right . project manager : um , well thank you all , huh . i dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? user interface : no . res i did not . project manager : no ? well , user interface : perhaps the rest ? project manager : then i think it 's a good thing that i made a separate slide of them marketing : ja , project manager : so you can all read them . oh , well not in this presentation . hmm user interface : project manager : should be in there . well , i can tell you them uh from my laptop . um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet ."
