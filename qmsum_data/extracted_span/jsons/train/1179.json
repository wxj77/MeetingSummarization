    "answer": "marketing : i think we can just go to my presentation then . we can wind up . or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions . user interface : marketing : so the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with lcd , without lcd , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . user interface : mm . marketing : and the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . user interface : marketing : of course in that we could put lcd or recognition to be more technologically innovative . and the third one is easy to use . industrial designer : well i think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we have n't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the tv screen uh uh with just four buttons . marketing : okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in paris and milan they have detected this trends that the this year it 's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . user interface : spongy spongy . mm mm . marketing : so i think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . user interface : mm mm . marketing : and the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . user interface : but the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling ? industrial designer : okay . user interface : we have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . industrial designer : a sponge . marketing : yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . user interface : spongy . marketing : one is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use . user interface : marketing : so these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . industrial designer : marketing : so now you have with lcd and without lcd , so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it does n't it looks uh it does n't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . so user interface : so marketing : we can make our study on this and user interface : so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? marketing : no no we have you have designed two products now , project manager : yeah . marketing : one is with lcd and without lcd . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? marketing : according to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it uh with lcd and without lcd ? okay let us make this l_ and without lcd . on on this scale the lcd remote control . how do you look how does it look ? user interface : mm . mm . marketing : d is it very fancy or does n't look much fancy ? industrial designer : well it does n't look much fancy i 'll i 'll say three or four . marketing : and you both agree for that ? project manager : and you ? user interface : i think we can improve on the design . marketing : user interface : som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design . industrial designer : yeah . it 's it it project manager : user interface : um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . industrial designer : technical aspects . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : as for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help . marketing : so i take three on with lcd ? industrial designer : yeah a three . marketing : so without lcd how would you rate it ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh four . i think it 's it 's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it 's not complicated marketing : four . industrial designer : so removing the lcd um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : and in the sense of innovativeness , with lcd . industrial designer : well it 's it 's the same for both so i will give a five , six . user interface : mm . marketing : five with lcd and user interface : industrial designer : well five also uh norman please . user interface : yeah project manager : uh user interface : from the innovation aspect i feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of tv programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we 've uh a lot of functionalities . industrial designer : with lot of functionalities . user interface : so that is uh that is uh for both th marketing : so without lcd ? user interface : our gi i think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement industrial designer : user interface : because we designed them . marketing : no no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? user interface : yeah . uh the innovation is v is very high i think . project manager : for lcd . marketing : with lcd . user interface : both . marketing : and without lcd ? industrial designer : mm for both it 's the the same innovations . user interface : for both . it 's the same innovation . so maybe i can put six to seven . marketing : okay . industrial designer : six , let 's go for six . project manager : without lcd . user interface : both . marketing : no actually uh to make it with lcd you make more efforts . so i there is high innovativeness included if you make it with lcd y industrial designer : yeah . marketing : then when it is without lcd there is not much innovativeness . project manager : uh no innovative yeah . user interface : uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the lcd ? marketing : so we ca n't go project manager : industrial designer : talk about user interface : we have n't really uh determined what are actually actually project manager : marketing : i mean that what you are sayin that 's what the design user interface : it 's good to have a lcd but what are we gon na display on a lcd ? industrial designer : marketing : no it 's like this , project manager : marketing : i mean on the lcd , according to what i understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have lcd , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . project manager : so let 's remove it . user interface : yeah ? yeah . yeah but project manager : but industrial designer : but you have the same programme on the tv screen . marketing : uh then user interface : yes exactly . project manager : this is the problem . marketing : no on the tv you do n't it does n't display on the tv now . industrial designer : if you have the lcd , but if n marketing : lcd ? then uh there is no meaning in having it on the tv . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a user interface : but you can not display all on a lcd . marketing : i mean that depends upon your design , so user interface : anyway for for the users who who who opt for lcd we 'll give them the give them the lcd , marketing : i mean user interface : we give what the customer uh wants , right . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : marketing : so without lcd you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? and which do you recommend e easy to use , with lcd or without lcd ? user interface : industrial designer : well i think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , user interface : yeah industrial designer : and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product user interface : industrial designer : so i will give a six for the easy to use . user interface : yeah i think project manager : no it 's just if i i see the the f the rate i think it 's better to do it without lcd . user interface : sorry . project manager : because that 's with lcd just will increase the price , marketing : yeah . project manager : and i thi i they have the same rate so without lcd it will be user interface : yeah . marketing : or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . so i mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch user interface : yeah . marketing : without lcd and without speech recognition . even then our product is going to be very good . industrial designer : yeah , it 's cheaper to produce . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm . s industrial designer : and uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so marketing : yeah that 's right . user interface : yeah . i have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . i think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : for the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . for kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , marketing : yeah yeah that 's right . user interface : so that 's why we have the parental module . uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what i 'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . so in terms of easy to use i think it 's very user customisable . user customisation is very important yeah . yeah industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so marketing : so without lcd i just take it five ? project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : w uh marketing : or you want it to be six ? user interface : i think it 's the same . industrial designer : um six . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yes as you say , with better uh project manager : without lcd . marketing : s s oh i think it 's better to have this without lcd . industrial designer : yeah . and to improve the the look . marketing : as our programme manager s pro project manager says that without lcd it is going to reduce the cost also , user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : and it 's going to be much simpler to use . industrial designer : yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so let 's go back to our laboratory and user interface : to improve on the design . project manager : what a what what about the sys speech recognition ? what about the integration of speech recognition ? user interface : huh ? the speech recogniser is a add-on module . right ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that 's going to be an optional . user interface : yeah . marketing : if somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . industrial designer : project manager : ah so it 's optional with the okay . marketing : it 's an optional . industrial designer : it 's optional yeah , since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than project manager : i think it will be i think i user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : i think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh marketing : yeah , but i mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module project manager : yeah . or ma yeah . marketing : and so that their parents ca n't use it . project manager : or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same marketing : in the same set , yeah , and and individual buttons to make them work . project manager : yeah . user interface : the problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and does n't want the parental control because it 's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . so we might lose the customer because of this . i do n't know , project manager : so you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional . user interface : what do you think uh ? yes exa what do you think , i do n't know . you are marketing manag . project manager : uh marketing : i mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a tv user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : or to the number or singles who have a television . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so based on that i think user interface : yeah . but the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? project manager : i think it inc increase . industrial designer : well you can if you had uh something li project manager : i think it i increases . industrial designer : oh no , because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because it 's three different pieces uh to to to build but marketing : but you can make it on a single p_c_ with three different options . industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah user interface : industrial designer : it 's i think it 's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module , but uh user interface : mm . mm . yeah . marketing : on the same p_c_b_ user interface : well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gon na maintain the the you 're gon na keep the same customer , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah yeah . user interface : because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . marketing : yeah that 's right . user interface : so so marketing : i mean you could just provide with an optional . user interface : yeah i i so if do n't do n't buy now they can buy i in the future . so in in that way you 're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . industrial designer : marketing : so it 's something like a microsoft product update . project manager : and and we we we we we we do n't want that . industrial designer : user interface : we 're not trying to follow the microsoft and we do n't want to the m project manager : marketing : updates and we sell it . we make updates and sell it . industrial designer : user interface : yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? project manager : industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , it depends on the v production . marketing : and uh what 's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? industrial designer : well so marketing : uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? industrial designer : yeah yeah marketing : do you require different types of p_c_b_s and industrial designer : i think we are yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but i do n't think it will uh increase the cost too much so marketing : or uh it could be like this the p_c_b_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . industrial designer : uh well but it 's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well user interface : yeah . what we can change is to propose the customers with skins . for example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin marketing : yeah , yeah that 's right . user interface : and then people just feel that oh i have a new skin and looks better . industrial designer : yeah yeah we can have the same global shape user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah that 's right . user interface : yeah . yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh ? industrial designer : sponge . marketing : i think you need to look into the material . user interface : yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing . industrial designer : marketing : yeah yeah . industrial designer : okay ."
