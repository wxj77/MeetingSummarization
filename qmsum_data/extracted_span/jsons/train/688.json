    "answer": "professor g : and did did you try simply to smooth um to smooth the the t to to smooth stronger the the envelope ? phd e : um , no , i did not . professor g : because i mean , it should have a similar effect if you phd e : yeah . professor g : i mean , you you have now several stages of smoothing , so to say . you start up . as far as i remember you you smooth somehow the envelope , you smooth somehow the noise estimate , phd e : mm - hmm . mmm professor g : and and later on you smooth also this subtraction factor . phd e : uh , no , it 's it 's just the gain that 's smoothed actually phd b : uh , actually i d i do all the smoothing . phd e : but it 's smoothed professor g : ah . oh , it w it was you . phd b : yeah , yeah . phd e : uh yeah . professor g : yeah . phd e : yeah . no , in this case it 's just the gain . professor g : yeah . phd e : and professor g : uh - huh . phd e : but the way it 's done is that um , for low gain , there is this non nonlinear smoothing actually . for low gains um , i use the smoothed sm uh , smoothed version but for high gain @ @ { comment } it 's i do n't smooth ."
