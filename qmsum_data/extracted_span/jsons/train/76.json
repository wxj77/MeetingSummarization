    "query": "<s> how could the schools that are causing significant concern be identified ?",
    "answer": "huw irranca-davies am : thanks for that . i think , for any impartial reader of the way that the trends have been going on this , there is some good news within that , in that , certainly , those schools that might have been identified as have been okay but coasting along , seem to be moving up the categories , although we still do have that\u2014 . well , it 's what the system is there to do , it 's to identify those schools that do need that additional support . and i like your analogy of a triage system\u2014'you 're fit ; keep on doing what you 're doing and do it well ; you need more support , we 'll put the support in . ' but , can i turn to those schools that are causing significant concern , and how we identify them ? the estyn chief inspector 's conclusions at the end of the 2017-18 report that these schools are not being identified early enough\u2014there 's a need to do something urgently about these concerns , particularly in secondary schools . have we addressed that ? are you content that we 've addressed that concern ? was he right ? kirsty williams am : no , the chief inspector is absolutely right\u2014absolutely right . i 've got no beef with that statement at all . in some ways , when a school goes into special measures , in a way , that 's a failure of the system , because that should have been identified sooner . so i 've got no beef , as i said , with the chief inspector saying that . huw irranca-davies am : so just to ask , bearing in mind the earlier discussion we were having , how is it that we do n't identify those schools ? kirsty williams am : that 's it\u2014you 're quite right . undoubtedly , what categorisation has done is led to a greater understanding , i think , on behalf of local education authorities ' and school improvement services ' knowledge about their schools . i think knowledge around schools is greatly enhanced by that process . but we are not there yet in terms of necessarily , then , moving those schools more quickly , once they 've been identified as needing the highest level of support to see improvement . and secondary schools is a particular , particular challenge . so you will have seen from the last publication of categorisation data that our primary sector continues to improve\u2014more and more and more of our primary schools are in a green rating , which is very satisfying to me . but we have got more of an issue with secondary schools , and we have a particular issue with the same schools being identified in that level of categorisation . so even though we 've identified them as needing that extra help , they are not moving at pace away from that system . so there are two things that we are doing at the moment . the first is , we are , again , looking at different sets of data that can give us even earlier warning systems that things are going wrong in a school\u2014and perhaps steve will explain later . for instance , staff sickness , and carefully monitoring staff sickness , because there is a direct correlation between high levels of staff sickness in a school and what is going on in the school . and steve can explain some of this work later . but we 're piloting a new approach to those schools that are causing concern . each local authority has been asked to identify two of their high schools that they are particularly worried about . and we have a new multi-agency approach , working with those schools to try and move them more forward . so it 's two from each region , a multi-agency panel , working with the school . and that multi-agency panel includes the school itself , the local authority , the regional consortia school improvement staff , estyn and welsh government\u2014as a multi-agency panel to support improvement in that school . so , for instance , what would normally happen , estyn would come in , estyn would make a judgment on the school\u2014requiring special measures or urgent improvement\u2014and estyn would go away . they 'd go away for six months , and then they 'd come back in six months , and they 'd make another judgment , 'no , still not good enough ' , and disappear for six months . we 're saying\u2014estyn and the welsh government have agreed that 's not the best approach ; estyn need to be part of the solution , rather than just coming and making a judgment . the initial feedback from this trial is very , very positive . actually , we 've had local authorities coming to us and saying , 'can we put more schools in ? rather than just having two of our high schools , can we engage more in this project and this pilot ? ' it 's being evaluated by cardiff metropolitan university and swansea university , so we 're having some academic overview to see , actually , does this approach work , can we evidence it\u2014that it actually makes a difference ? and it 's actually\u2014i 'd like to claim all the credit for it , but it 's actually not dissimilar to something that 's happening in scotland as well . but we knew that carrying on doing the same old thing clearly was n't moving these schools , we needed a new approach , and this is what we 're doing at the moment . so it 's relatively new , but the initial feedback is positive . steve , i do n't know\u2014"
