    "query": "<s> what did bill blair respond to the firearms seizure issue at pearson airport when talking about the measures to guarantee social stability ?",
    "answer": "mr. bob saroya : mr . chair , on may 27 the cbsa seized 65 small handguns at pearson airport , the largest firearms seizure on record . it is clear that smuggled handguns are the weapon of choice for criminals . why is the prime minister focusing on an ineffective municipal ban ? hon . bill blair ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) : mr . chair , i would point out that gun violence in any of our communities is unacceptable , and it 's important that governments and communities take steps to prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals . that 's why we do important work at our border to keep guns from being smuggled into our country , but it also necessitates additional work . i do n't think you can talk about gun violence without talking about stronger gun control . that 's why our government has taken a very strong position and will strengthen gun control to keep canadians safe . the chair : mr. saroya , you may have a 10-second question , if that 's possible , please . mr. bob saroya : mr . chair , covid-19 has not stopped gun violence in the gta . my constituents are concerned about shootings minutes away from their homes . we know the liberals ' gun ban wo n't change anything , but a focus on smuggled guns and criminals will . when will they make that change ?"
