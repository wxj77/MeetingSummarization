    "answer": "professor c : i mean this is the kind of reason why i remember when at one of the switchboard , workshops , that uh when we talked about doing the transcription project , dave talkin said , `` ca n't be done `` . grad f : right . professor c : he was he was , what what he meant was that this is n't , you know , a sequence of phones , and when you actually look at switchboard that 's , not what you see , and , you know . and . it , grad f : and in in fact the inter - annotator agreement was not that good , right ? on the harder ones ? professor c : yeah i mean it was phd g : it depends how you look at it , and i i understand what you 're saying about this , kind of transcription exactly , professor c : yeah . phd g : because i 've seen you know , where does the voicing bar start and so forth . professor c : yeah . phd g : all i 'm saying is that , it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really said , and which syllables were reduced . uh , if you 're gon na add the features it 's also useful to have some level of representation which is , is a reduced it 's a pronunciation variant , that currently the dictionaries do n't give you professor c : mm - hmm . phd g : because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion . professor c : right . right . phd g : so people purposely do n't add them . so it 's useful to know which variant was was produced , at least at the phone level . phd d : so it would be it would be great if we had , either these kind of , labelings on , the same portion of switchboard that steve marked , or , steve 's type markings on this data , with these . phd g : right . that 's all , i mean . exactly . professor c : yeah . phd g : exactly . professor c : yeah , no i i do n't disagree with that . phd g : and steve 's type is fairly it 's not that slow , uh , uh , i dunno exactly what the , timing was , but . professor c : yeah u i do n't disagree with it the on the only thing is that , what you actually will end en end up with is something , i it 's all compromised , right , so , the string that you end up with is n't , actually , what happened . but it 's it 's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened . phd d : and it 's more accurate than , phone labels . phd g : mm - hmm . professor c : but . and it 's more accurate than the than the dictionary or , if you 've got a pronunciation uh lexicon that has three or four , grad f : the word . phd d : yeah . professor c : this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever , phd d : so it 's like a continuum . phd g : right . professor c : so sure . phd d : it 's you 're going all the way down , phd g : right . right . professor c : yeah . phd d : yeah . phd g : that 's what i meant is professor c : yeah . phd g : an and in some places it would fill in , so the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere . grad f : well phd d : right . phd g : so there are some things that you do n't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram , phd d : mm - hmm . phd g : but you know what phone it was and that 's about all you can all you can say . phd d : right . phd g : and then there are other cases where , nasality , voicing phd d : it 's basically just having , multiple levels of of , information and marking , on the signal . phd g : right . right . professor c : yeah . grad f : well the other difference is that the the features , are not synchronous , phd g : right . grad f : right . they overlap each other in weird ways . phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad f : so it 's not a strictly one - dimensional signal . professor c : right . grad f : so i think that 's sorta qualitatively different . phd g : right . you can add the features in , uh , but it 'll be underspecified . th - there 'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features . grad f : well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system , that the states were features , rather than phones . phd g : and i if you 're well , we we 've probably have a separate , um , discussion of , uh of whether you can do that . postdoc b : that 's well , is n't that i thought that was , well but that was n't that kinda the direction ? grad f : yeah . postdoc b : i thought professor c : yeah , so i mean , what , what where this is , i mean , i i want would like to have something that 's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research i have in mind , so it should be something broader . but , the but uh where i 'm coming from is , uh , we 're coming off of stuff that larry saul did with with , um , uh , john dalan and muzim rahim in which , uh , they , uh , have , um , a m a multi - band system that is , uh , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and em , to um , estimate , uh , the , uh , value for m for for a particular feature . ok . and this is part of a larger , image that john dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he 's sort of imagining that , individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate , of of these , these kinds of something like this . might not be , you know , exact features that , jakobson thought of or something . but i mean you know some , something like that . some kind of low - level features , which are not , fully , you know , phone classification . and the the th this particular image , of how thi how it 's done , is that , then given all of these estimates at that level , there 's a level above it , then which is is making , some kind of sound unit classification such as , you know , phone and and , you know . you could argue what , what a sound unit should be , and and so forth . but that that 's sort of what i was imagining doing , um , and but it 's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones , or not . you would n't necessarily have to . um , but , again , i would n't wan na , would n't want what we we produced to be so , know , local in perspective that it it was matched , what we were thinking of doing one week , and and , and , you know , what you 're saying is absolutely right . that , that if we , can we should put in , uh , another level of , of description there if we 're gon na get into some of this low - level stuff . phd d : well , you know , um i mean if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , you know , you the the question is , do they do that on , meeting data ? or do they do that on , switchboard ? grad f : that 's what i was saying , postdoc b : w well it seems like you could do both . grad f : maybe meeting data is n't the right corpus . postdoc b : i mean , i was thinking that it would be interesting , to do it with respect to , parts of switchboard anyway , in terms of , professor c : mm - hmm . postdoc b : uh partly to see , if you could , generate first guesses at what the articulatory feature would be , based on the phone representation at that lower level . professor c : mm - hmm . postdoc b : it might be a time gain . but also in terms of comparability of , um , professor c : mm - hmm . phd d : well cuz the yeah , and then also , if you did it on switchboard , you would have , the full continuum of transcriptions . postdoc b : what you gain yep . phd d : you 'd have it , from the lowest level , the ac acoustic features , then you 'd have the , you know , the phonetic level that steve did , postdoc b : mm - hmm . phd g : yeah that that 's all i was thinking about . postdoc b : and you could tell that phd d : and , yeah . phd g : it is telephone band , so , the bandwidth might be phd d : it 'd be a complete , set then . postdoc b : and you get the relative gain up ahead . professor c : it 's so it 's a little different . so i mean i we 'll see wha how much we can , uh , get the people to do , and how much money we 'll have and all this sort of thing , phd g : yeah . postdoc b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd d : but it it might be good to do what jane was saying uh , you know , seed it , with , guesses about what we think the features are , based on , you know , the phone or steve 's transcriptions or something . to make it quicker . professor c : but , might be do both . grad f : alright , so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous , but then you could imagine , nudging them here and there . phd d : adjusting ? yeah , exactly ."
