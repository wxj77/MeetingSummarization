    "answer": "suzy davies am : i just want to ask you now about students and their maintenance loan grants . i think they 're getting , around now , the money going into their bank account that they would normally have expected at this time of year . that 's right , yes ? kirsty williams am : that 's correct , yes . suzy davies am : what 's happening to those students who would normally be living in digs somewhere but are now living at home ? are they likely to be asked to reimburse part of the cost , because obviously it 's not as expensive to live at home as away , and what 's likely to be happening with the maintenance loans over the summer holiday period , potentially ? because we 've had a period now where students ca n't top up their maintenance loans by going out and working on weekends or working in the evenings , or whatever , so their income has been impacted . just in the round , what kind of conversations are happening around that ? again , it 's probably a four-nation approach , i would imagine . kirsty williams am : thank you , suzy . you are correct to say that our student support regime does allow for a lower payment to be made to those students that stay at home during their studies , but i want to reassure students that there will be no change to their student support payments just because they have left their universities and have decided to go home . there should be no change . also , we are continuing , it should be important to say , to pay education maintenance allowance at this time for our fe students that are eligible for that , even though , obviously , for ema there is an attendance requirement , but clearly that is not appropriate to enforce at the moment . you are correct\u2014this is a worrying time for many students in higher education , especially for those who are looking to graduate at this time and are going out into an economy that has been tremendously badly hit by the pandemic . at this time , we continue to have conversations with nus wales about what can be done within a welsh context , but , as you quite rightly say , also within a uk context , to support students who may have been affected . we are continuing\u2014on our webpage we have a frequently asked questions section that advises students in the first instance , especially when it comes , for instance , to the cost of accommodation\u2014to have those discussions , and i 'm very grateful that , in some cases , some of our institutions have been able to waive or partially waive accommodation fees where students have vacated their accommodation and have returned to their usual home address . but we will continue to have dialogue with nus wales and with our counterparts across the country to look to see what more we can do to support students at this time ."
