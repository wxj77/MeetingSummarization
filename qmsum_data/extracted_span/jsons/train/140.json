    "answer": "marketing : well uh what comes up for me is that if we 're gon na if we 're gon na be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we 're not we 're gon na be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . project manager : mm . mm . yep . marketing : so that 's , from a marketing perspective i i see i see a lack . and so we have to go , i think , in the other direction . what are we gon na have that makes this thing better than project manager : well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is the opportunity that 's presented , i guess . marketing : right . yeah . no , i i agree with you . project manager : okay . marketing : so what i 'm talking about is i see that one side we 're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gon na be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it does n't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . project manager : okay . marketing : so that 's that 's that was my reactions . project manager : yeah . but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . marketing : yeah yeah . project manager : so we 're quite fixed . so we 're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that 's uh that 's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . industrial designer : yeah bu but we we 're designing only the remote , project manager : yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : we not design the tv . so uh we 're gon na be removing the teletext out of any tv that we people use our remote with . marketing : yeah . 'kay . that 's right . industrial designer : so it 's kind of a stupid decision . marketing : i think we take with you . project manager : but there 's also the potential for mark there 's a market here for our lost teletext . user interface : right . project manager : for example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible . twenty-five euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here i guess . marketing : that 's what i 'm that 's what i 'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gon na be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gon na be hap unhappy 'cause it took they ca n't ac access their teletext . okay . 'cause we 're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . project manager : k yeah . marketing : so so it 's it 's not that i 'm criticizing the product at all . it 's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? what are we bringing in to take the place of this , project manager : mm 'kay . marketing : and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up . industrial designer : marketing : if we lose one we need to bring two or three . industrial designer : this does n't work . so yeah function design . um you guys know me , pedro , and um what i found is we want to do fashion and i think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . if basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . um something cute and small . the big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . so we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at . project manager : industrial designer : and um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people wo n't wo n't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their the stations . there 's no need to have that in the remote . so um um as for what i would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh i will change the colours on the on the logo , but um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . um and uh although i th i th i 'm still here recommending the teletext so i 'll remove that , i guess , but um we should go for the project manager : but i t i think what the the management recommendation was less that there 's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we should n't have it . so i i still think if it 's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : because otherwise we 're just going to i mean even if it 's necessary or not , if you if you 're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it is n't more expensive for us to k make because as far as i understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? so it should be in there . user interface : right as far as industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i it 's just uh the cost of an extra button . i mean software-wise there 's really no difference . project manager : yeah . okay . is n't user interface : i think . marketing : i have maybe a silly question . i in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there 's gon na be the it 's gon na be out-moded teletext . i i do n't understand how those two things are connected . how does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? i do n't understand that . project manager : well maybe what we 're getting into here is the the idea of uh internet through the tv for example . so that might play on what we can do . industrial designer : yeah the they 're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that user interface : scheduling . um to find out what what you 're watching even if there 's commercials you know . industrial designer : and now yeah marketing : okay . industrial designer : and now you can c look it over internet . but i still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . user interface : i think i ha i agree . marketing : yeah 'cause , yeah , i just i do n't see the cross-over between computers and television . i mean i do see the cross-over in some sense , industrial designer : yeah , but it 's not happen yet . yeah . marketing : but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , okay . user interface : well for me project manager : well you have digital tv still already . user interface : yeah . marketing : so so if we make the cross-over and we 're gon na view television on computers then we 're then we 're losing the the necessity of the remote . s user interface : unless you have a project manager : well there there is a for example on digital tv systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , user interface : yeah . project manager : and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : a a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can yeah , and there 's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live tv and things like that . they 're just features from the internet uh from computers are are coming into the tv sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext . marketing : okay . project manager : so now the things to think here are that that there 's gon na be more functionality , potentially that we can handle . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah but we we do n't we 're not aiming a command for that . that 's the thing . and all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and user interface : i think a lot of that 's proprietary anyways . you 're not gon na be able to , you , like command a tivo with our remote . i do n't think . project manager : mm . but still there there 's an opportunity . if if it 's , for example , a trainable one then we 're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . industrial designer : yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so project manager : mm . okay . industrial designer : well i dunno . one way the other teletext was there but i guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs . user interface : i think if it 's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . just you know industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah i do n't i do n't see the logic . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i i do n't see the logic in elimination of teletext , i just i i project manager : yeah , and neither do i in fact . marketing : but i 'm not a tech-mind either . i just do n't see the cross-over between computers and and and project manager : bu uh . marketing : 'cause we are designing something for a television , okay . industrial designer : project manager : i 'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wan na be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there 's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it does n't affect the price . user interface : right it 's just not industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and it 's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it 's a common issue . um what we can do is , well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . right ? marketing : solar . project manager : yeah . user interface : and s for some people yeah . well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? marketing : but solar user interface : like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you 're not using it , so you 'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we 'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . you never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries . and also you can i i think it 's a good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole . you know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . marketing : blah , i like it . i like the idea , but we 're talking about in cost is gon na probably double . user interface : it w it would increase the cost . marketing : but boy , we can sell this thing , because there 's no batteries , it 's environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . user interface : and you could page the remote if you lose it . maybe there 's a button on the cradle . marketing : yep , that 's right . i really see project manager : now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ? marketing : but the cost i no no . no no , we have t we have to change the end cost . project manager : we we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ? marketing : there 's uh i mean i do n't see it anyway . yeah , that 's gon na be up to these guys . i my reaction is no , but user interface : what i can do is i can d look into ho well pedro and i can look into how much this might increase our our costs project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gon na have on our on our final numbers . project manager : yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that 's gon na be marketing : well , see i i see i i 'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . you know , let 's let 's sell this wholesale for for fifty euros , sixty euros . let 's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the rolls royce of of remote controls . user interface : i i marketing : every home 's got to have it . if you do n't have one , hey what kind of remote do you have ? oh you 've got one of those , oh fantastic , i want one of those too . user interface : yeah . marketing : i just do n't have enough money right now . user interface : i just do n't know about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level i think we 'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the d_v_d_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . which is a pretty basic function that w we 've opted out of . and additionally we 're m maybe not supporting teletext um project manager : nah , i think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . marketing : user interface : but i do think there are some basic features that we do n't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . marketing : yep , one one thing i do n't understand is h they 've they 've given us this package , okay . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . they say they say okay here you go . they gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : and and w it 's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . i do n't think it 's our place to create their product for them , maybe it is . i do n't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh , but to me it 's like , okay , you have got your here 's our ideas , okay . and then let them look at those ideas and they say , yeah well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , you know we like this idea , this idea no , but to me it 's it 's about a choice , do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ? beca i i do not i do not see the market niche for the product that they 're handing f handing us right now . user interface : i don i i d marketing : i do n't see it . user interface : i have to disagree though . i think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or uh who 've broken their remote and do n't wan na send back to the manufacturer , they just wan na run out to the store and get a remote , and then they 're gon na look on the shelf and they 're gon na see ours is the nicest looking remote . it does what they need . these are n't i i think that it project manager : and and th to get to back to another point , sorry uh uh for cutting in but , i th i think it 's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple tvs , yeah , 'cause it 's selling on its own . user interface : right . project manager : it 's not going to be specifically for hitachi tvs or or whatever . marketing : right . user interface : right . marketing : no i understand that . project manager : so technologically , if i understand it , uh tvs tv remote 's working exactly the same way as video remotes and d_v_d_ remotes . all you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is is know the the f like some four-digit code . so saying that it works with all tvs is equivalent to saying that it 'll work with d_v_d_s and other things . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : nope , they 've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . project manager : oh okay okay . industrial designer : yeah y y you you would n't marketing : they 've identified this product limita project manager : we have done this . marketing : that 's why i say i do n't i do n't see the market niche for this . industrial designer : the interface will be different . project manager : i see . marketing : if we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for d_v_d_s , v_c_r_s and everything , then i can see the market niche , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but we we 're only identified as going for televisions without teletext . user interface : right . marketing : and it 's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that 's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , user interface : well here 's project manager : and i i 'd marketing : because who wants just a television remote ? project manager : mm sorry . user interface : right . we he well here 's my thing about that . marketing : i do n't . user interface : if you 're in the market for this ultimate remote , you 're not gon na go for just a television remote . if it ca n't control if it ca n't control your your d_v_d_ player and a al if y if you ca n't get that all-in-one ultimate remote , that just you can throw all your other remotes away . i 'm not gon na buy a d seventy-five euro remote . marketing : that 's right . i i i have a tendency to agree with you . i really do . project manager : so we really ca n't chase that . marketing : that 's why i say i quest i q i question the marketability of the product . i really question where we create the demand . user interface : so i think what we project manager : we 're really looking for something basic ."
