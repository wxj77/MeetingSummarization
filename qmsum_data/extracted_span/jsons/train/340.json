    "answer": "marketing : okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one . industrial designer : okay . marketing : so basically what we need to do is some of the things that we 've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . industrial designer : okay . marketing : so what we sort of wan na do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then i 'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . industrial designer : okay . marketing : so we 'll just go through them one at a time and we 'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we 've created conforms to the following criteria . so we can do this one first . first we wan na know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . so like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i 'm gon na say it 's like a three . that 's just my opinion . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : what does each of you project manager : i i kind of think it 's it 's unique enough that i 'd give it a one or a two . marketing : okay , well give it a number , project manager : okay . marketing : sorry . project manager : i will give it a one . industrial designer : um i dunno if it 's it 's creative . i dunno if fancy is the word i would use . i dunno if any of them are fancy in i 'd say two , because c unique . marketing : okay . user interface : i 'll go for two . marketing : and two , awesome . alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? i think it 's extremely functional , i 'm gon na give it a one . industrial designer : yeah , one . user interface : i think it 's it 's functional , it 's also pretty basic , so i 'll give it a two . marketing : okay . project manager : um functional . i think it 'll get everything done , i think it might be a little confusing at first , um , i do n't know if that 's gon na be a later one . marketing : okay . well there 's some other ones , i will address that , project manager : okay , then i 'm gon na give it a two . marketing : yeah . awesome , okay . um we wan na know next if it 's technologically innovative . project manager : did you give a functional ? marketing : yeah , she said it was one . project manager : okay . marketing : um is it technologically innovative ? mm . not really , i mean not so much , 'cause we we do n't have the lcd screen , we do n't have fancy chip . other than what it looks like , i dunno if it 's really project manager : well , the kinetic battery . industrial designer : in the battery , that 's it . marketing : i kinetic battery is a big one , so . industrial designer : how many people would notice that , though ? marketing : mm . but it project manager : but they 'll notice it after like a year , marketing : but we know it 's there . project manager : they 'll be like hey , i have never changed the battery . marketing : and if it 's made of like latex , that whole idea , that 's pretty cool . project manager : mm . just the material . marketing : i 'll give it a three . 'cause it we could 've picked a lot of features that would 've made it really industrial designer : yeah . i i would say that it 's yeah , like fancy versus creative it 's it 's different . but does that equal innovative ? i dunno . i 'll give it a three . marketing : alright . everyone else ? user interface : i 'd say it 's technologically it 's not it 's not unique , i mean it 's it 's just it is just pushbuttons um , so i i 'd give it a four . project manager : think i 'm gon na go with the four as well . marketing : mm 'kay . project manager : i really like that kinetic battery though . marketing : next , is it easy to use ? just so you know , easy to learn will be separate , project manager : mm 'kay . marketing : so do n't overlap them . industrial designer : okay . marketing : i think it 's really easy to use . i 'll give it a two . industrial designer : um i 'll give it a one . pretty hard to mess up . user interface : i 'll say one . project manager : uh let 's say two . marketing : alright . um we next wan na see if it has a spongy quality industrial designer : user interface : marketing : and if indeed it 's made of latex or rubber i it 's spongy all the way . industrial designer : project manager : give it a one . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : i wonder if it bounces when you drop it . industrial designer : ooh , that you could n't marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : industrial designer : it 'd be harder to break , harder to lose . user interface : yeah . project manager : 'cause there would be less impact maybe , . marketing : iain , what do you give it ? user interface : i 'd i 'd give it a one . marketing : alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? industrial designer : user interface : uh um . marketing : well , is it gon na be yellow ? industrial designer : it it might be , 'cause that 's our corporate colour , is n't it ? project manager : that 's right , yeah , corporate colour , we did n't keep that in user interface : yeah . project manager : um well industrial designer : we might wan na keep it yellow . project manager : if we i know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that 'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that 's more fruity . marketing : yeah , but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , project manager : um and can we have like an r_r_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? industrial designer : if we had a yellow sure . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : oh , yeah . project manager : fruity , so fruity . industrial designer : so marketing : alright , so i think it it 's industrial designer : it was inspired by the potato , so i think it 's pretty fruity . marketing : yeah . project manager : i think i it 's kind of mangoey too . marketing : industrial designer : oh , mango user interface : mangoey is better , yeah . marketing : yeah . i industrial designer : that that user interface : i like mangoes . marketing : okay , i 'm giving it a one the mango put me over . industrial designer : that 's a much more trendy than a potato marketing : what are what 's everyone 's numbers ? user interface : uh two . industrial designer : marketing : alright um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? remember earlier we discussed that people do n't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . i think we really took that into account a lot , so i 'm gon na give it a one . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , me too . user interface : uh one . marketing : did you say one , rose ? okay um , also we talked earlier about r_s_i_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like carpal tunnely kind of thing . do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? i think i 'll give it a two , 'cause i almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gon na happen . project manager : it 's gon na be hard . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , yeah . project manager : and if it 's repetitive movement it is gon na be only four buttons that you 're constantly pushing , but um marketing : um um worth the risk , i think . project manager : i like how it fits in the hand though so i i 'd go with a two . industrial designer : yeah . i 'll i 'll say two as well . because older people that are n't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , marketing : 'kay . industrial designer : but user interface : yeah i 'll i 'll say two . marketing : alright , awesome . and the ease of learning it . i know you were saying that you 're a little bit nervous about that , i dunno . it sort of reminds me of the ipod . i just got mine , i still have n't read the instruction book and i 'm doing okay , so and i 'm not good at learning technology . so i 'll give it a two . industrial designer : the menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but i think if it 's one it 's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you 'll have it afterwards . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so i 'd i think i 'd give it a two i guess . user interface : i think it it 's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are industrial designer : oh , good point . user interface : and that could take a bit of learning at first , but marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : once you 've , yeah once you 'd learned how to use it , i think it is a lot easier . so i 'd i 'd give it a four . marketing : okay . project manager : i think i 'd give it a four too . it 's a pretty high learning curve , it 'll be easy once you 've done it , but industrial designer : user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . alright , um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we 're not addressing that at all , so project manager : we we industrial designer : project manager : i think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , but marketing : okay , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? i 'm gon na i 'm gon na give it a four , 'cause i think that you can still if it 's in between somewhere where you ca n't see it , you 're kind of not gon na find it , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but anywhere else it 's gon na stand out . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um i 'd say i 'd give it uh a three , i guess it depends on how tidy you are normally . project manager : mm i 'd give it a four . user interface : um i 'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah . project manager : small too . marketing : alright , we also said simplicity , how w how well does it address just being simple ? industrial designer : simple to use or simple in design ? do you know ? marketing : i think overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , industrial designer : marketing : so those are the next two things we 're gon na look at . separate from fancy , like that sort of thing . industrial designer : right . marketing : um it like wants to be simple but it 's not like totally totally simple , so i 'm gon na give it a two . industrial designer : i 'm give it a three i guess . user interface : i 'll give it a two . project manager : three . marketing : alright , and fashionable ? project manager : it 's totally fashionable . i 'd give it a one . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : it 's hot , i mean it 's a mango , come on . project manager : mango . marketing : i mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? i think it 's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . industrial designer : i dunno . user interface : industrial designer : i do n't think it 's quite as fashionable as my robot remote project manager : i do like uh the little martian one . industrial designer : or alien or whatever he was . marketing : yeah , the toggle on off switch , it 's really appealing . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : number . industrial designer : um two . user interface : three . marketing : and does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? just that it would se serve our audience . i do n't see why not . project manager : mm-hmm . i think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements . um yeah , that 's good . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so i 'll give it a a two . industrial designer : yeah , i 'll say two . marketing : alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we did n't talk about ? project manager : well um we did n't we did n't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let 's let 's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r_r_ on it . industrial designer : shall we uh well i think all of them should have an r_r_ . project manager : all of them should have r_r_ , yeah . marketing : and so we 're gon na do that , so it will address it , project manager : mm-hmm . mm 'kay . marketing : fine . okay . project manager : lovely ."
