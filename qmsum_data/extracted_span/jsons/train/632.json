    "query": "<s> how did the wjec tackle the concerns raised by darren millar am ?",
    "answer": "gareth pierce : i think that the evidence is that different learners see their requirements differently . and i agree that a textbook is part of the picture that should be available . but i think the evidence also shows that not every young person will use them ; perhaps the teacher uses them . there is an emphasis , for example , from one pupil there , on that traditional model of revision , namely class notes and his own revision notes , but that he personally also wanted a textbook . so , certainly , the content of a textbook is going to be important , and that that 's available in some form or other . it was very interesting to know , for example , that when he was describing the traditional model of revision , he felt that he 'd had quite a lot of the content of the textbook through the classroom notes . much of that digital content , of course , corresponds to the content areas of a textbook , but it 's just in a different form . but , in general , there should be a textbook . and some of our frustration as well is that the timetables of some individual publishers do n't always get us to the point where there is a textbook available in time . that does n't happen so often in english medium , but we know about that gap in time in the welsh provision . darren millar am : well , it 's happened fairly regularly in the english-medium textbook world , has n't it ? my daughter\u2014she featured in that video\u2014has got her rs qualifications coming up , and she only had a textbook over the easter period . i mean , it's completely unacceptable . and many others in that video are also being affected . you mentioned digital resources ; not everybody 's got access to digital resources in their own homes , even , in wales . so , are n't we giving a significant disadvantage to those learners who might need the traditional 'swotting up from a textbook ' method of revision and benefit from that ? mike ebbsworth : we do ensure that those digital resources include things that the teachers can also print . most of these are resources for teachers so that the teachers can adapt them for their own use , to suit the learners who are in front of them at any given time . but certainly there are materials there . if there are activities , then those activities can be printed off and handed to pupils so that they can take them home . so , i would be sceptical about that comment . we are thinking of the totality , ultimately . gareth pierce : i think you 're right that the availability of technology is an important part of this big picture . the young people talk about websites and blogs , and we 're talking about digital resources , so being able to reach those resources , i think , is vital in wales . it 's interesting to note two contradictory remarks from the teaching associations in the letters . one praises what 's available digitally , whereas another teaching organisation sees this as more work for teachers . as mike said , we've created those resources that can be adapted . one teaching organisation says that it just creates more work , while another organisation says that the digital resource is something that's very valuable . of course , the headteacher at the end was praising the fact that , in a situation of crisis or unacceptable timetables , we have succeeded in creating some resources that will be in the textbook later , but available digitally at an early stage . but i agree with your core comment that technology is vital , and access to that , and also the content of a textbook in some form is vital as well . darren millar am : mr blaker , you would agree that a textbook should be an essential core piece of the resource pack available for each qualification . philip blaker : i think we would n't want to underplay the desirability of textbooks , recognising that different learners have different learning styles and may look to different resources . i think what i 'd like to raise is a wider concern about textbooks in their current model , which is very much around the fact that every time there 's a change in a specification , there 's a new textbook , which is designed around that specification and is endorsed by an awarding body , which is a nice model for a publisher , because every time there 's a change , there 's an opportunity for a new textbook . there are two concerns that i 'd like to raise on that . first , the focus on teaching and learning . ofsted and also estyn have raised concerns about the focus in teaching on teaching to the test as a common concern in both nations . i have a concern that having a textbook that is endorsed by the awarding body and is designed specifically around that specification may lead to some of that tendency . and also , there 's the sustainability of the model . we know that we 're about to go into another round of reforms associated with the curriculum change . that 's going to lead to another round of textbooks that may need to be focused on qualifications . i think i 'd much rather see that textbooks are seen as a curriculum resource that are broader than , perhaps , the model of endorsement and the current model of publication suggest . darren millar am : so , you do n't think that a textbook for each subject should be a core resource for pupils who are learning in advance of examinations . emyr george : i 'd just like to pick you up on that . i think a textbook for each subject is absolutely an essential part of the broad range of resources that you 'd want to see available for people to choose what they prefer , but on a subject , perhaps , rather than a specific specification , because i think there 's a tendency to conflate the two , and much of the underlying content that is assessed in one specification , or a new updated specification , will remain unchanged . it is true that there may be a different focus or emphasis , or a different style of questioning , but that can be picked up more nimbly through supplementary digital resources , for example , which can highlight that change , particularly to a teacher , so that they can shape their lesson planning around that . what we are looking at here are reformed gcses and reformed a-levels in subjects that are well-established , traditional subjects , and so whilst it is not necessarily the ideal , i think it's important to remember that there is already a good deal of pre-existing resources , including textbooks , out there in schools already . we 're not for a moment saying that that is the situation that we would want everybody to be in . i think it might be preferable if the textbook was perfectly bespoke to the course and did n't contain any extraneous material , but that perhaps is an ideal picture and i think we do need to remember that there are already many resources out there that are available to teachers and to students . darren millar am : but of course , unlike their peers in perhaps other parts of the uk , we have teachers who are having to go meticulously through some of these other resources that might be available to determine whether they 're appropriate for use in the classroom , given that the specification is different in terms of the new qualifications . can i just ask you about the disadvantage that some learners might face as a result of the lack of textbooks ? mr blaker , i note that you sought to reassure the committee in some of your opening remarks about the fact that equivalent outcomes are what you aim to achieve in discussion with the wjec in terms of the outcome of assessments , and i think that that 's a very positive thing . but , how do you differentiate between the different learning styles of individual students who are in that cohort to ensure that the disadvantage that one faces because they 're somebody who relies particularly heavily on textbook-type learning , traditional sort of swotting up for examinations , versus someone who is much more digitally aware and able to use digital resources\u2014 ? how do you make sure that it 's fair to the cohort as a whole , while still enabling some of these individuals for whom textbooks are important not to face disadvantage within that cohort ? philip blaker : the systems that are in place are very much around making sure that awarding is fair across the whole cohort . it 's very difficult\u2014in fact , it would be impossible\u2014to unpick all of the different factors that might affect performance , because you could well have a textbook that 's been available for some time , it may be somebody 's preferred leaning style to use a textbook , but did they use that textbook effectively ? you know , did they open it in revision or did they not open it in revision ? so , there are so many different factors that can affect individual performance . i think it 's impossible to unpick a particular aspect like the availability of resources . motivation would be one thing , an individual learner 's motivation in the subject . the biggest input would be the quality of teaching . i think evidence has been provided to you by the regional consortia , which we saw yesterday . they particularly wanted to stress this point i think ; that the quality of teaching is probably the most dominant and the most important factor in relation to a learner 's ultimate performance in the examination . darren millar am : i understand that , but you also understand that someone who does n't have the resources that they feel are best suited to them face some element of a greater disadvantage than others for whom , perhaps , textbooks are less important . gareth pierce : i think also , perhaps , related to that , it is important to mention digital literacy here . every young person in wales , i would hope , taking gcse or a-level , should have that digital literacy in order to source the valuable materials available\u2014that they should have those skills . then , they have the choice whether they go down the digital route , or do they do as mike suggested\u2014much of the digital material can be printed\u2014or do they then turn to textbooks , in the hope that those would be available ? that would then allow for a pupil 's personal learning choice to be reflected . it 's also important for teachers to confirm that their ways of teaching do support these alternative approaches taken by pupils . not every pupil will choose to learn or revise in exactly the same way . so , the flexibility for the pupil is very important , i think . darren millar am : i understand that , but i 've got people in my constituency who have n't even got a broadband link at home , so there 's a digital disadvantage as well . can i just ask you about the reason why this has taking so long to sort out ? it was back in 2015 that concerns were first raised about the availability of textbooks in both english and welsh for the new qualifications . we 're three years on , what on earth has been happening in the interim and why is it taking so long ? if you 've got these resources digitally , why ca n't they just be compounded into textbooks pretty straightforwardly ? gareth pierce : i think the main reason for that is that there are three series of reforms of qualifications that have happened . there were some in 2015 , other subjects in 2016 , and other subjects in 2017 . those three cycles of reform have all suffered from the short timetable that was between approving a qualification and publishers being able to start the work . perhaps an interesting comparison would be a subject being taught for the first time in 2015\u2014where that subject has reached now in terms of resources . i would hope that each one of those subjects have more available now in terms of resources , and therefore we are adding each year\u2014not textbooks but digital resources . there are more past papers available , of course . we are working on sample work at the request of teachers . so , every subject is moving on over a period of time of five to six years while that specification is being studied . but those same difficulties have , unfortunately , affected 2015 subjects and 2017 subjects , and that 's why we 're discussing the same thing in 2018 ."
