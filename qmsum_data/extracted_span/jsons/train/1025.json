    "answer": "professor c : in fact , uh m my brother 's a gerontological psychologist and he he uh came up with an an uh a uh body age test which uh gets down to sort of only three measurements that are good enough st statistical predictors of all the rest of it . and one of them is is the distance that you have to hold it at . phd d : give someone a piece of paper and then they oh . phd e : yeah . professor c : yeah . grad a : we 're we 're live by the way , so we 've got a good intro here professor c : oh . yeah . about how old i am . grad a : we can edit that out if you want . phd d : oh , that 's optional . professor c : no , that 's ok . grad a : ok . so . this time the form discussion should be very short , phd d : you know . phd e : mm - hmm . grad a : right ? professor c : it also should be later . because jane uh is not here yet . grad a : good point . professor c : and uh she 'll be most interested in that . uh , she 's probably least involved in the signal - processing stuff so maybe we can just just uh , i do n't think we should go though an elaborate thing , but um uh jose and i were just talking about the uh uh , speech e energy thing , phd e : the @ @ professor c : and i uh phd e : yeah . professor c : we did n't talk about the derivatives . but i think , you know , the the i if i can if you do n't mind my my speaking for you for a bit , um uh . right now , that he 's not really showing any kind of uh distinction , but uh but we discussed a couple of the possible things that uh he can look at . um . and uh one is that uh this is all in log energy and log energy is basically compressing the distances uh between things . um another is that he needs to play with the the different uh uh temporal sizes . he was he he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds uh , and uh he 's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows , as we discussed before . um and uh and the other thing is that the yeah doing the subtracting off the mean and the variance in the uh and dividing it by the standard deviation in the log domain , may not be the right thing to do . grad a : hi jane ! we just started . phd e : yeah . grad a : could you take that mike there ? phd d : are these the long term means ? like , over the whole i mean , the means of what ? grad a : thanks . professor c : uh b between between phd d : all the frames in the conversation ? or of things that professor c : between neither . it 's uh between the pauses uh for some segment . and so i i his his he 's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds . and so you take that . and then he 's he 's uh measuring at the frame level still at the frame level , of what"
