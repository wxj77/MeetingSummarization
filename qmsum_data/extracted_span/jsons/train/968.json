    "query": "<s> what did the meeting discuss about the various supports for the agricultural sector ?",
    "answer": "mr. jol godin : thank you . the prime minister 's answer during his appearance on tout le monde en parle did n't inspire much confidence and does n't line up with the deputy prime minister 's comments . how can the government be proud of announcing $ 252million in assistance for the agri-food sector , when that is less than 1 % of all the program funding the government has committed to help canadians get through the covid-19 crisis ? clearly , the government does n't see the food supply chain as a priority and has no regard for farmers and pork and beef producers . does the government realize that eating is vital to canadians ? when is the minister of agriculture and agri-food going to adjust the program and show respect for canadian farmers ? hon . marie-claude bibeau : i have the utmost respect for farmers . we are going step by step . we 've already confirmed various supports for the agricultural sector . this week , we focused on beef and pork producers and processors , as well as sectors with product surpluses that can be redirected to food banks . i can assure my fellow member that this is an additional step and that more supports are on the way in the weeks ahead . bear in mind that a number of programs are already available to farmers . mr. jol godin : i 'd like to switch topics now . portneufjacques-cartier is home to a company that is already licensed by health canada and that , for 20years , has been manufacturing medical equipment including masks , face shields and thermometers . this is equipment our health workers need . the company has a licence from the federal government . in mid-march , health canada reached out to the company to find out how much equipment it could manufacture to help fight covid-19 . the company confirmed that it could immediately start producing 200,000masks a week , ramping up to a million masks over the next few weeks . forty-five days later , it is still waiting on its first order from the canadian government . we are managing a crisis with a limited supply of medical equipment . can the health minister tell us why , 45days later , this company licensed by health canada has n't received an order ?"
