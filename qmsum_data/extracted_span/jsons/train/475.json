    "answer": "postdoc h : now , i mean , you know , it 's true , i mean , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gon na have as much overlap . phd f : adam ! postdoc h : but , um , i i uh , so we 're gon na have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . but , um , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? phd e : turn off professor a : i do n't think we should have rules of participation , but i think we should try to get a variety of meetings . that 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at uw , that i probably can do more than you guys , cuz you guys are probably mostly going to get icsi people here . but we can get anybody in ee , uh , over professor d : mm - hmm . professor a : and and possibly also some cs people , uh , over at uw . so , i think that that there 's a good chance we could get more variety . postdoc h : ok . just want to be sure there 's enough data to phd b : they 're still gon na overlap , postdoc h : ok , good . phd b : but mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data { comment } from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . professor d : mm - hmm . professor a : mm - hmm . professor d : wasn - but w i think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . postdoc h : mm - hmm . professor d : so it also depends on the style of the group of people . professor a : right . phd b : like the , um , dominance relations of the people in the meeting . postdoc h : mm - hmm . on the task , and the task . grad g : mm - hmm . postdoc h : it 's just i just wanted to uh , professor d : yeah . postdoc h : because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to . professor d : yeah . postdoc h : not not entirely modify it , but lessen it if if it 's desired . but if if that 's sufficient data i just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which ca n't be processed . professor a : ok . so i 'm just writing here , we 're not gon na try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gon na try to get more variety by i using different groups of people postdoc h : time . professor a : and different sizes . postdoc h : fine . and i you know , i i know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . professor a : e e yeah . and then the other thing might be , um , uh , technical versus administrative . postdoc h : i just wanted to be sure . professor a : cuz if i recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . postdoc h : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . well , i just as as as a contributary eh , so i i know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . they 'll just say , you know you know , `` wait till each person is finished before you say something `` . so it is possible to lessen if we wanted to . but but these other factors are fine . i just wanted to raise the issue . professor a : well , the reason why i did n't want to is be why i personally did n't want to { comment } is because i wanted it to be as , uh , unintrusive as possi postdoc h : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor a : as you could be with these things hanging on you . postdoc h : oh , yeah . yeah , i think that 's always desired . i just want to be sure we do n't that we 're able to process , i u uh , you know , as much data as we can . yeah . professor d : yeah . did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with l liberman ? phd b : mm - hmm . professor d : what phd b : and there was a big division , professor d : what what do they phd b : so liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . professor d : yeah . phd b : so there 's lots of recordings that they 're not close - talk mike , professor d : yeah . phd b : but and and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , um , political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings . boring stuff like that . um , and then the cmu folks and i were sort of on the other side in cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . um , so there 're really two different kinds of data . and , i guess we just left it as @ @ { comment } that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , professor d : mm - hmm . phd b : but newly collected data would would be natural meetings . so . professor d : actually , th @ @ { comment } the cmu folk have collected a lot of data . is that is that going to be publicly available , phd b : as far as i know , they h have not . professor d : or ? phd b : um , but e grad g : it 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ? phd b : i 'm not sure . um , if people were interested they could talk to them , but i i got the feeling there was some politics involved . grad g : i think @ @ gon na add that to one of my action items . professor d : just to check . phd b : i i do n't know . professor d : yeah . w we should know what 's out there certainly . grad g : yeah . phd b : i mean , the professor d : yeah . grad g : cuz i had thought they 'd only done far - field , phd b : i think you need to talk to waibel and grad g : intelligent - room sorts of things . phd e : oh , really ? it 's those guys . grad g : i had n't known that then they 'd done any more than that . professor d : oh , they only did the far - field ? i see . grad g : yeah . phd b : but they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . but as far as i know they did n't offer that data to the community at this meeting . grad g : mm - hmm . phd b : but that could change cuz mark you know , mark 's really into this . we should keep in touch with him . professor d : yeah . well , once we send out postdoc h : yeah , i think professor d : i mean , we still have n't sent out the first note saying `` hey , this list exists `` . but but , uh , once we do that professor a : is that an action item ? professor d : yeah . it 's on i already added that one on my board to do that . so , uh uh , hopefully everybody here is on that list . we should at least check that everybody here ? grad g : i think everyone here is on the list . professor d : yeah . phd f : i 'm not . grad g : i think you are . professor d : we have n't sent anything to the list yet . phd f : oh ! ok . postdoc h : yeah . professor d : we 're just compiling the list . phd f : i see . grad g : i i added a few people who did n't who i knew had to be on it even though they did n't tell me . professor d : mm - hmm . phd e : who specifically ask not to be . grad g : like jane , for example . professor d : yeah . grad g : you are on it , are n't you ? postdoc h : yeah , i am . professor d : yeah . postdoc h : so , i w uh , just just for clarification . so `` found data `` , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ? phd b : what they mean is stuff they do n't have to fund to collect , postdoc h : it sounds like such a t phd b : and especially good postdoc h : yeah , ok . phd b : well , i mean , `` found `` has , uh , also the meaning that 's it very natural . it 's things occur without any you know , the pe these people were n't wearing close - talking mikes , but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . postdoc h : ok . but it includes like standard corpora that have been used for years in linguistics and other fields . phd b : mark 's aware of those , too . phd e : `` hey , look what we found ! `` phd b : that would be found data because they found it and it exists . postdoc h : exactly . phd e : `` i found this great corpora . `` yeah . phd b : they did n't have to collect it . of course it 's not `` found `` in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . grad g : `` psst . { comment } want to buy a corpora ? `` postdoc h : yeah . ok , ok . phd b : but what he means is that you know , mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , postdoc h : that 's interesting . phd b : web stuff , postdoc h : mm - hmm ."
