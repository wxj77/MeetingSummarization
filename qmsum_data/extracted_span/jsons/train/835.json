    "query": "<s> what is the product positioning of the remote ?",
    "answer": "marketing : so that was um what i meant there , and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gon na be as important as money , because if we 're gon na sell this thing , i think the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . twenty five euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it 's , gee i just got ta have that . and take out their wallet and buy it . so it 's got ta be really attractive and it but it 's got ta go to market by september , 'cause anything that you do n't already have out there in september showing it around , is n't gon na sell for christmas . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um and then i 'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour alright , thanks for that . um alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 'cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it 's lost somewhere in the room . um so those are two things that we definitely do wan na address , uh we wan na s make it as simple as possible , we wan na make it um obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep , and i think that those are things after my research that we definitely wan na try to incorporate . 'kay can we go to the next slide please ? okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . that is the selling point , the thing that 's gon na make it an impulse purchase . uh because once there 's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs do n't come back . industrial designer : marketing : if somebody says , oh i 'll come back and get it next week you 're dead . they 're never gon na come back and buy it . you 've got ta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing . and , in order to make it really sellable we 've got ta shorten the learning curve , make sure it 's really intuitive and easy to use . we have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that 's why i 'm saying , simplicity is good . finding it 's important , obviously you ca n't use it if you ca n't find it . so we 've got ta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and i 've already said this several times but i put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five euros i 'm not gon na take that . has to be so great that they 're gon na say , uh twenty five euros is n't much . um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . project manager : so these are the two things we should come up wit with . so uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group . um . i guess in many ways everybody . everybody who has a tv . industrial designer : mm , tv , yeah . user interface : tv television we was . project manager : yeah , and i think today there are probably not many people who do n't have a tv . industrial designer : do n't tv , yeah . project manager : there are a few but in general not . now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but i think within the target group we have subgroups . we have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so i think that 's uh one group that 's certainly important . um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it 's really very clear . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and uh i do n't know how much we want to cater to children 's use . i mean that 's a question um whether that 's important that children can really use it or not . so this these are just some thoughts i have on it , and um i dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we 're gon na design this one thing marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : or whether we 're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups . user interface : marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . well you know there 's the old motto , children under six never shop alone . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so if you 've designed something that 's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wan na go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull . user interface : project manager : that has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but i think uh i 'm i 'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we 're looking at different groups . i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : you know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever you know user interface : different colours . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that 's right . you can make a banana shaped one . project manager : yeah , for example you know . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . mm . project manager : but the question is really , who is our target group . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : do we look at one target group ? and with the twenty five euros you know can we can we afford to have uh i 'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ? user interface : marketing : respect . mm . user interface : okay . no uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty project manager : right . user interface : and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes . project manager : with with mm-hmm . industrial designer : we can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know . project manager : well that 's that 's user interface : but in a family in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they can not buy three different remotes . industrial designer : yeah . children and everybody , yeah . user interface : they would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh industrial designer : yeah of course that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you ca n't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know . marketing : what about the electronics ? that 's not really gon na change much , is it ? project manager : yeah . user interface : cost effective . industrial designer : no , it it does n't cost , yeah . project manager : no marketing : that that w that wo n't change much , will it uh ? industrial designer : yeah . does n't does n't does n't matter . project manager : the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , marketing : i d i would n't think so . project manager : and i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . project manager : the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . i mean the basic design i understand will be the same , marketing : yeah . project manager : but the question is how much will that set us back if let 's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : so that remains to s to be seen but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a tv . marketing : that 's right , and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? project manager : yeah , well that 's that 's the question . marketing : um the same electronics and basically all that 's gon na be different is the plastic case . industrial designer : hmm hmm . marketing : and in that case we could probabl moulded plastic is n't all that expensive is it ? industrial designer : uh no . mm , i i i do n't think no . it 's not . marketing : um you as an industrial person ? project manager : well maybe there 's there 's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ? marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : they have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , marketing : yeah . mm-hmm . project manager : and maybe something like that , user interface : okay . project manager : that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let 's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package . marketing : well there 's a real idea yeah . mm-hmm . project manager : and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately . marketing : yeah . project manager : you know , industrial designer : yeah , like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that . marketing : right . user interface : um marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : that 's right , and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , marketing : uh yeah . project manager : then they can go to the store and for a few uh francs or euros whatever they can buy industrial designer : yeah . marketing : an alternate package . project manager : an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know . marketing : yeah . okay . user interface : but uh yeah i i have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people . project manager : well i think i think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote industrial designer : yeah , but uh marketing : well i think we can only aff , yeah . user interface : okay . project manager : and what the only change is gon na be um industrial designer : yeah . project manager : the funct d t yeah uh marketing : cosmetic . user interface : of th okay . project manager : the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , user interface : okay . project manager : um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : five minutes that was i guess tha that 's the old message . marketing : warning , finish meeting now . project manager : finish meeting now . um um . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um industrial designer : yeah , maybe , yeah , yeah . project manager : but i think industrial designer : if we do some more research , maybe we . project manager : i i think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody . if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that . user interface : okay , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : hmm yeah , project manager : do we agree , do we ? industrial designer : i think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it 's sort of like yeah . marketing : okay but we have to l project manager : do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , of course , yeah . marketing : okay , fair enough . project manager : okay ? so now i understand it 's lunch break . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : and um . so that 's what we will do . marketing : okay . user interface : okay . project manager : so hank you very much . industrial designer : thank you ."
