    "query": "<s> why did marketing disagree with project manager when discussing the technical functions on the remote control ?",
    "answer": "marketing : yeah . it 's alright . um alright , i 've done some research for functional requirements . um yes . the working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . uh , i 've lined them up here . uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . i uh have found some interesting things . we do we do got a market . um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . so if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as i uh quoted here from the uh results . zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . that 's quite a lot . um , relevant options are , of course , power buttons . although , only used once per hour . uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . that does n't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . but it sure um says we should n't make it too uh complicated . fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . and um an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . and uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . so , what i was thinking oh , wrong side . we should n't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . group features for a higher usability , uh what i was claiming in the previous meeting . um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . project manager : okay . marketing : and um , if you want to implement v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ options , group them in the button , not too uh yeah . small buttons , so they wo n't be very um , how do you say project manager : visually presents . marketing : yes , wo n't be very present , thank you . and a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who do n't really care for trendy looks or whatever , i guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . that was kind of what i found . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : okay . project manager : well , then we i 'm gon na show you some of the new project requirements and then we gon na discuss on uh what features we find important . marketing : yes . project manager : uh , well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , i think . marketing : project manager : because um uh s decided to put they have decide to put two additional requirements forward . well , now i see four . marketing : two ? project manager : that 's kinda strange . well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . well , i think that may be so , but well , we ca n't just leave the teletext button off . user interface : well project manager : it 's impossible , i think . user interface : no way . marketing : no uh , i agree , i agree . project manager : so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and do n't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or marketing : not too much , no . project manager : you know , it 's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we have to think of that . the remote control should only be used for television . otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . so maybe we should leave all d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ related features off completely . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : i do n't know . i think that uh that 's what they 're trying to say . marketing : project manager : uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . new products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . so you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but , well , they 're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger marketing : i do n't really agree actually , to be honest . it 's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . it 's only like thirty percent of the total market . project manager : yeah , but it is it 's is a dif it 's a fact that the th th that bigger market you 're talking about , we already cover that . marketing : mayb yeah ? project manager : our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . that 's the one we have n't covered yet . so i think that 's what the problem is . we have n't got remote controls for uh"
