industrial designer : you should probably speak . project manager : i mean industrial designer : okay . project manager : what do marketing : okay , well , i mean the obvious one is changing channels . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : i think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . marketing : yeah . project manager : so , yeah . marketing : yeah , okay . project manager : so , turning channel , of course . volume setting . industrial designer : uh just one note to the chan channel changing . do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? i mean those nine plus one or two ? project manager : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : i think it would be a b industrial designer : because it 's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . project manager : yeah . user interface : mm . project manager : on the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it 's marketing : yeah , i user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay so so we keep all these all these buttons . project manager : maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like user interface : yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . project manager : uh industrial designer : like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . project manager : yeah . maybe something like that . industrial designer : or using the names and the keyboard marketing : ah yeah . project manager : uh . industrial designer : i dunno . user interface : or project manager : maybe user interface : or something . project manager : oh i do n't know . oh . maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and industrial designer : you mean like hierarchical structure . project manager : and inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch . user interface : mm-hmm . okay . like categorising channels . project manager : if you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you 've you plus plus plus . industrial designer : okay , so s user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : oh sorry . project manager : i it just an idea . user interface : okay . project manager : what about the settings of the tv ?

marketing : uh required . industrial designer : should should should n't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? because generally project manager : it 's it 's a kind of setting , i think . it should fit in those settings functions . user interface : mm . settings . project manager : because it 's not a very current useful function . marketing : uh , well i think when they say power button they mean to turn the tv on and off . project manager : no , i think it 's after after five minutes or something a timer industrial designer : yes . well i i uh project manager : i i think , no ?
