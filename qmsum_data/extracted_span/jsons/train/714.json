    "answer": "grad a : so these little circles you have by the d ? is that ? ok . ok . grad d : that 's exactly what we 're looking for . grad b : i d i just i do n't like having characterizing the constructions with location and path , or li characterizing them like that . cuz you do n't it seems like in the general case you would n't know how how to characterize them . grad d : you would n't . grad b : i mean or , for when . there could be an interpretation that we do n't have a node for in the i mean it just seems like @ @ has to have uh a node for the construction and then let the chips fall where they may . versus uh , saying , this construction either can mean location or path . and , in this cas and since since it can mean either of those things , it would light both of those up . grad d : it 's the same . grad b : thoughts ? questions ? grad e : i 'm thinking about it . grad d : it will be the same . grad e : um grad d : so i think r in here we have `` i 'll go there `` , right ? grad b : answers ? grad d : and we have our info - on . so in my c my case , this would sort of make this happy , and this would make the go - there happy . what you 're saying is we have a where - x question , where - x node , that makes both happy . right ? that 's what you 're proposing , which is , in my mind just as fine . so w if we have a construction node , `` where is x `` , it 's gon na both get the po posterior probability that it 's info - on up , grad b : mmm , yeah . grad d : info - on is true - up , and that go - there is true - up , as well . which would be exactly analogous to what i 'm proposing is , this makes uh makes something here true , and this makes something also something here true , and this makes this true - up , and this makes this true - up as well . grad e : i kinda like it better without that extra level of indirection too . you know with with this points to this points to that , and so on because i do n't know , it grad a : is - uh , grad d : yeah , because we get we get tons of constructions i think . because , you know , mmm people have many ways of asking for the same thing , grad e : yeah . grad b : yeah , sure . grad a : yeah . grad d : and grad b : i change i changed my mind actually . grad a : so i agree with that . i have a different kinda question , might be related , which is , ok so implicitly everything in edu , we 're always inferring the speaker intent , right ? like , what they want either , the information that they want , or it 's always information that they want probably , of some kind . right ? or i i do n't know , or what 's something that they grad d : the system does n't massage you , no . no . grad a : i i i do n't ok . so , um , let 's see . so i do n't know if the i mean i if th just there 's more s here that 's not shown that you it 's already like part of the system whatever , but , `` where is x `` , like , the fact that it is , you know , a speech - act , whatever , it is a question . it 's a question that , um , queries on some particular thing x , and x is that location . there 's , like , a lot of structure in representing that . grad d : yep . yeah . grad a : so that seems different from just having the node `` location - x `` and that goes into edu , right ? grad d : yeah . precisely . that 's that 's grad a : so tha is that what you 're t talking about ? grad d : so , w exactly . we have su we have specified two . grad a : wh what kinds of structure we want . grad d : ok , the next one would be here , just for mood . grad e : mm - hmm . grad a : mm - hmm . grad d : the next one would be what we can squeeze out of the uh i do n't know , maybe we wan na observe the uh , um , uh the length of of the words used , and , or the prosody and g a and t make conclusions about the user 's intelligence . grad a : ok . so in some ways grad d : i do n't know , grad a : um , so in some ways in the other sort of parallel set of mo more linguistic meetings we 've been talking about possible semantics of some construction . grad d : yeah . grad e : mm - hmm . grad a : right ? where it was the simulation that 's , according to it you know , that that corresponds to it , and as well the as discourse , whatever , conte infor in discourse information , grad d : mm - hmm . grad a : such as the mood , and , you know , other stuff . so , are we looking for a sort of abbreviation of that , that 's tailored to this problem ? cuz that that has , you know , basically , you know , s it 's in progress still it 's in development still , but it definitely has various feature slots , attributes , um , bindings between things grad d : mm - hmm . yeah . u that 's exactly r um , why i 'm proposing it 's too early to have to think of them of all of these discourse things that one could possibly observe , grad a : uh - huh . mm - hmm . grad d : so let 's just assume grad a : for the subset of grad d : human beings are not allowed to ask anything but `` where is x `` . this is the only utterance in the world . what could we observe from that ? grad a : ok . that exactly `` where is x `` , grad d : in ter grad a : not the the choices of `` where is x `` or `` how do i get to x `` . just `` where is x `` . grad d : just just `` where is x `` . grad e : yeah . grad d : and , but you know , do it do it in such a way that we know that people can also say , `` is the town hall in front of the bank `` , so that we need something like a w wh focus . nuh ? should be should be there , that , you know , this the whatever we get from the grad a : wait , so do , or do not take other kinds of constructions into account ? grad d : well , if you if you can , oh definitely do , grad a : ok . where possible . ok . grad d : where possible . right ? if i if if it 's not at all triggered by our thing , then it 's irrelevant , grad a : mm - hmm . grad d : and it does n't hurt to leave it out for the moment . um , but grad a : ok . um , it seems like for instance , `` where is x `` , the fact that it might mean um , `` tell me how to get to x `` , like do y so , would you wan na say that those two are both , like those are the two interpretations , right ? the the ones that are location or path . so , you could say that the s construction is a question asking about this location , and then you can additionally infer , if they 're asking about the location , it 's because they wan na go to that place , in which case , the you 're jumping a step step and saying , `` oh , i know where it is grad d : mm - hmm . grad e : yeah . grad a : but i also know how to get they wan na seem they seem to wan na get there so i 'm gon na tell them `` . so there 's like structure grad e : right , th this it 's not it 's not that this is sort of like semantically ambiguous between these two . grad a : i do you kn sort of uh , that grad d : mm - hmm . grad e : it 's really about this but why would you care about this ? well , it 's because you also want to know this , or something like that right ? grad a : so it 's like you infer the speaker intent , grad d : mm - hmm . grad a : and then infer a plan , a larger plan from that , for which you have the additional information , grad e : yeah . grad d : mm - hmm . grad a : you 're just being extra helpful . grad d : think uh , well this is just a mental exercise . grad a : yeah . grad d : if you think about , focus on this question , how would you design that ? grad e : mm - hmm . grad d : is it do you feel confident about saying this is part of the language already to to detect those plans , and why would anyone care about location , if not , you know and so forth . or do you actually , i mean this is perfectly legitimate , and i i would not have any problems with erasing this and say , that 's all we can activate , based on the utterance out of context . grad a : mm - hmm . and just by an additional link oh . grad d : what ? grad a : right , grad e : right . grad a : like , grad d : and then the the the miracle that we get out the intention , go - there , happens , based on what we know about that entity , about the user , about his various beliefs , goals , desires , blah - blah - blah . grad a : with context and enough user information , yeah . grad e : yeah . grad d : absolutely fine . but this is the sort of thing , i i propose that we think about , so that we actually end up with um , um , nodes for the discourse and ontology so that we can put them into our bayes - net , never change them , so we all there is is `` where is x `` , and , eva can play around with the observed things , and we can run our better javabayes , and have it produce some output . and for the first time in th in in the world , we look at our output , and um and see uh whether it it 's any good . you know ? i mean , grad e : here 's hoping . here 's hoping . right ? now cross your fingers . grad d : yeah , i i mean , for me this is just a ba matter of curiosity , i wan na would like to look at uh , what this ad - hoc process of designing a belief - net would actually produce . grad e : yeah . { comment } yeah . grad d : if if we ask it where is something . and , maybe it also h enables you to think about certain things more specifically , um , come up with interesting questions , to which you can find interesting answers . and , additionally it might fit in really nicely with the paper . because if if if we want an example for the paper , i suggest there it is . grad e : um - hmm . yeah . grad d : so th this might be a nice opening paragraph for the paper as saying , `` you know people look at kinds of at ambiguities `` , and um , in the literature there 's `` bank `` and whatever kinds of garden path phenomenon . grad e : mm - hmm . grad d : and we can say , well , that 's all nonsense . a , a , uh these things are never really ambiguous in discourse , b , b , do n't ever occur really in discourse , but normal statements that seem completely unambiguous , such as `` where is the blah - blah `` , actually are terribly complex , and completely ambiguous . grad e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad d : and so , what every everybody else has been doing so far in in in you know , has been completely nonsensical , and can all go into the wastepaper bin , and the only grad e : that 's always a good way to begin . yeah . yeah . grad d : yeah . and the the the only grad b : i am great . grad d : yeah . grad e : all others are useless . grad d : yeah . grad e : that 's good . grad d : nice overture , but , you know , just not really ok , i 'm eja exaggerating , but that might be , you know , saying `` hey `` , you know , some stuff is is actually complex , if you look at it in in in the vacuum grad e : mm - hmm . grad d : and and ceases to be complex in reality . and some stuff that 's as that 's absolutely straightforward in the vacuum , is actually terribly complex in reality . would be nice sort of , uh , also , nice , um bottom - up linguistics , um , type message . grad e : mm - hmm . true ."
