    "answer": "sian gwenllian am : good morning . in looking at your written evidence , you say that we must make it very clear to parents , guardians and the public that this legislation is not trying to criminalise parents , and that is clearly very important for you . how do you think we should do that and who should be doing that work ? sally jenkins : i think that 's really broad . obviously , colleagues in education , colleagues in social care , colleagues in preventative services , but also welsh government and the national assembly , in terms of those drivers in relation to that awareness raising are really , really key . if you look at some of the other campaigns that have been run , notably in relation to violence against women , domestic abuse and sexual violence , and echoing some of those building campaigns that have been done to raise awareness\u2014i think those would be really good models to begin to consider in terms of how this is taken forward with awareness . we also know that there are a number of routes that we can go through in terms of raising awareness . we have existing preventative services , we have all our universal services , we have the regional safeguarding boards and the national safeguarding boards . so , there are a number of avenues that we could then explore . in terms of not wishing to criminalise , i think if we look at the numbers , they are very , very small . and i think one of the things we need to hold on to in this is a sense of proportion about what is or is n't likely to happen once or if this bill ever gets to the point of royal assent\u2014they are small numbers who currently use this defence . it is about that wider issue of awareness raising , and using all of those avenues will help us to do that in the broadest sense . sian gwenllian am : do you , therefore , believe that this needs to be on the face of the bill ? that is , you do n't say this in your evidence . i 'd like to know your opinion on that . scotland is going to be making it a duty for scottish ministers to raise awareness of the impact of the bill . so far , the welsh government says that we do n't need to do that in wales . would n't it make it clearer for you if it was a clear duty on the face of the bill , for example as it was with the human transplantation ( wales ) act 2013 ? there was a duty in that act for ministers to promote transplantation . surely , that awareness raising aspect would be clearer for everyone if it was on the face of the bill . do you have an opinion on that ? huw david : well , welsh government have given that commitment , and i know the welsh government honour every commitment that they make\u2014 [ laughter . ] sian gwenllian am : that 's why i 'm asking . huw david : i do n't know whether that is necessary\u2014i 'm not a legislator . i think that there 's obviously an inherent interest in welsh government raising awareness , because we have to raise awareness effectively for this to be successful , otherwise we will have parents who feel that they 're being criminalised , and that 's the last thing we want . i think it 's worthy of consideration , but , as i say , i 'm not a legislator or a lawyer , so i do n't know what implications that will have long term . but to be fair to welsh government , i think that commitment is one that i 'm sure will be honoured , because welsh government will want to make a success of this bill if it does receive royal assent . sian gwenllian am : okay . but is it clear who would pay for all of that ? huw david : i 've suddenly changed my mind\u2014 [ laughter . ] i think it should be a duty on welsh government ministers\u2014absolutely . i do n't need to check with lawyers or legislators . there we go . and that 's the wlga position ; i do n't need to ask the other 21 leaders on that either . [ laughter . ] sian gwenllian am : would n't it make it clearer if there was a clear duty on the face of the bill that awareness raising had to happen ? it would be clearer , then , for local authorities and people in the front-line services what needs to happen . sally jenkins : i 'm going to echo huw . [ laughter . ]"
