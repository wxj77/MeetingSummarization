    "answer": "project manager : finances , that 's what we have here , what you drew . we have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . the sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway . so which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts . so well , we have sin one curve , a design . rubber design . and we had a special colour . suppose yellow is a special colour . so just half a euro for you have pushbuttons and an lcd display . you have the total of seventeen euros in production cost , which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . so , easy . what do we scrap . well think i had the best solution that i came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . user interface : i 'd say that too . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : because the lcd has more support on customer side . there are ninety one percent of uh the people , or something like that . but ninety percent who favour an lcd display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . i think it 's also harder to user interface : uh we do n't really have a extra function with the speech sample , marketing : yeah . user interface : which you ca n't do with a normal remote control , project manager : . so i ju user interface : which people already do . so project manager : i took that out . so and so it 's still stuck with thirteen , so i had to take out the special colour i suppose . and , yeah , i did n't see anything else i could take out . yeah , i could take out the push-buttons , marketing : pushbut project manager : but we need those . so , generally what i came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half euros , spe scrap speech recognition industrial designer : huh . marketing : special colour , yeah . project manager : and the separate covers can account for the if people want it , we 'll just then we 'll do it in black . we 'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it 's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . user interface : well , project manager : you make it d orange or whatever you want . user interface : i 'd i tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . project manager : it was a big issue , but user interface : so ca n't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? project manager : i 'll just go back . uh let 's just let 's see what okay , let 's just see what we no , we we have to be under twelve and a half . marketing : yeah , it project manager : it it 's not uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , industrial designer : okay , but there 's another problem . marketing : and the p user interface : okay . industrial designer : but there 's another problem . marketing : what industrial designer : if we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black does n't work obviously . project manager : i think you that 's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together . industrial designer : huh . huh . yeah . project manager : so i think yeah , it 's i think it 's y one of the it 's a good way to um to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too . just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we agreed before . industrial designer : right . i agree . project manager : and everything that 's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . but we need that for the lcd display . user interface : yeah . we do . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : then again , we have the lcd display , which is also expensive . b yeah , but those go together . and yeah , we could take out the curve . industrial designer : or say let 's lose rubber , take plastic . user interface : we could take out a curve indeed . project manager : could we could take out the curve . is that an option ? marketing : . project manager : for you ? industrial designer : although we are demolishing a little bit the style . marketing : but uh the and user interface : i think the colour is more important than the really the curve , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but project manager : user interface : because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control project manager : i think it 's it it does ruin it , marketing : yeah . the people project manager : but the fact that i t took that decision or t industrial designer : yeah . project manager : took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers . so you can change any colour you want . so it 's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . industrial designer : can we then not also uh change the material ? we take plastic for the basic cover project manager : you can take plastic , industrial designer : and project manager : but i d it 's something that 's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the marketing : spongy , yeah . industrial designer : we can put those to the to the other covers . project manager : and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , marketing : yeah . project manager : because they 're all plastic . marketing : and project manager : so which in in turn industrial designer : that 's true . project manager : rubber would increase durability industrial designer : but project manager : because it does n't break . industrial designer : okay . but what do you then suggest we 'd lose ? because we have to lose two things and i guess . project manager : i al like i said , i lost the speech recognition and i lost the special colour , marketing : but project manager : which would make this black a black and grey . industrial designer : okay , and that 's enough ? project manager : yeah , that 's that that that 's enough , because user interface : so black and grey is okay . project manager : i guess those are the basic colours . marketing : but project manager : so oh . user interface : which we can fabricate , project manager : i think those are basic col they want to user interface : okay . marketing : the people want to pay for for it , so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ? project manager : to ensure the profit . that that 's th that 's the order . we 're just uh we 're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company marketing : yeah . project manager : which say we do n't wan na spend more than twelve fifty for this . marketing : but we can take a risk . project manager : but that 's not for our that 's not our decision to take . we have a budget of twelve fifty per product . user interface : no , we basically marketing : okay , yeah . project manager : so user interface : we need to stick to that . project manager : stick that . i do n't think it 's really bad either . i mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing marketing : i hope the people will like it , project manager : to have marketing : but project manager : i think they would do . th i think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , marketing : project manager : because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . marketing : yeah . project manager : so i think it 's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect industrial designer : perhaps we should make m marketing : yeah . project manager : and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . marketing : the first sheet . project manager : so industrial designer : perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . and that 's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that . project manager : well i do n't think yeah . is it worth is it is it industrial designer : perhaps they decide tha user interface : but they do n't project manager : does it mean anything to the customer ? like , it like , we do n't care we do n't care that you had to industrial designer : of course . perhaps they uh no , but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let 's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs . project manager : true , industrial designer : we ca we uh we can at least tell them that project manager : but we did we did n't get that . so i think it 's industrial designer : you do n't know that . project manager : it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something . user interface : well project manager : but industrial designer : no , i 'm not uh talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this . we could at least m uh make it like this , like you said , project manager : they could , but uh industrial designer : and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . it is an still an option , but not for this price . project manager : it 's an option , but yeah , it 's true . so actually uh it 's not that much of an increase , but yeah . we can not contact them . user interface : and if we project manager : it 's just the order that we got . industrial designer : exactly , project manager : so that 's what we got ta go with . industrial designer : but marketing : yeah . project manager : so it 's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final , it 's either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , marketing : yeah . project manager : um or turn it yellow . so it 's uh something we have to decide on . industrial designer : i 'd say lose the curve and the colour project manager : i say lose the curve . oh that 's true , industrial designer : and project manager : we could lose the c i forgot that , yeah , sorry . uh the curve . so user interface : so which curve is that ba project manager : that 's just this one just d this is the banana curve . user interface : that 's basically that curve . project manager : so this would this would be straight . user interface : so we could u still have the comfort . marketing : yeah , that 's better . project manager : no , uh no , that would be a curve inside the thing , i guess . no , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . just like like that . which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . we could make it yellow then , user interface : i second that . project manager : but you second that , you second that we lose the curve . user interface : no , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . project manager : okay , yeah . user interface : so that 's not really that marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : so i think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . so we keep the curve . so the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . user interface : i would project manager : and i 'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has . industrial designer : oh . i agree . user interface : yeah . i would say i would agree with you on the colour , because that 's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah , um user interface : so we can always do that . project manager : i guess people are willing to pay for that . so i think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . marketing : yeah . project manager : so i think that would still make it a nice product . okay , we 're final on that . so it 's too bad we ca n't make the whole super thing . but anyways we 're here . um yeah ."
