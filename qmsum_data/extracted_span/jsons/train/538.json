    "answer": "project manager : uh okay , well do you wan na um give us your presentation industrial designer : okay , sure . project manager : and then then we can i do n't know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we 're marketing : yeah , it 's good well it 's good to get ideas out while they 're fresh in mind . project manager : yeah , exactly , yeah . marketing : um project manager : oh it 's something that 's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that 's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . marketing : not yeah . and not losing . and also it helps in terms of people not losing this , project manager : yeah . marketing : you know they they 're saying oh it 's i lose it in the couch . project manager : yeah . marketing : like we 're kind of what we 're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : that they user interface : i reckon one problem with speech recognition is um i 've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one was n't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . industrial designer : project manager : really ? user interface : channel up . marketing : right . user interface : marketing : oh really , you 've seen one before . project manager : do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it 's worthwhile incorporating it though ? user interface : um i think it 'd probably quite expensive to put in . industrial designer : sorry , do you mind passing me my notepad . project manager : mm . course not . industrial designer : thanks . cool , project manager : there you go . industrial designer : um . okay . um . project manager : right . industrial designer : well this is just the working design um . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : well this is just what how i would go about it . um i guess i try to define like what we 're doing now , try to define what we 're trying to get done . um i think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is . marketing : right . industrial designer : we 've used it , we 're familiar with it , but we 're we ca n't n we have n't narrowed down um exactly what the things we 're trying to fulfil , like besides the basics , i think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um and i just the idea is just to get everybody to um i usually have a have have a design that 's there as a basic , so , you know , things that to start everything going . but i guess everybody does have some idea , so i do n't think um there 's a need for that . um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so i 'll go into the diagram first . it just explains how the process goes through , from a project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . um okay , you need some power source . 'kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : like for example , voice recognition , right . that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that 's one perhaps constraint there . um th okay , the basic thing is there 's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . you know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button a_ , so i will do something with button a_ . so maybe button a_ is the power button , okay . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . um and i think that 's about it in terms of my design um . it 's fairly general , um and i guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you 're thinking , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : like um voice recognition , right , um , if it 's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we do n't have enough power . so it 's not really a constraint in that sense , project manager : okay . industrial designer : but i mean these are functionally , you know , the base , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : what the technology has to do . marketing : okay . project manager : okay . industrial designer : um so i guess the rest of it marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : i think we should maybe you you wan na go back to what the functions are ? i think that 's more relevant to a discussion ? marketing : 'kay . project manager : well , do you wan do you wan na finish up your your whole presentation then ? marketing : sure . sure . industrial designer : yeah , w i 'm done . project manager : are you are you all done ? industrial designer : more or less . yeah . ps oh , it 's just putting the rest of it into words , but it 's essentially the same thing . um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , project manager : okay . industrial designer : you know , stuff like that . project manager : okay ."
