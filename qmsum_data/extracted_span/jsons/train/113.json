    "answer": "janet finch-saunders am : going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of wales , the welsh and uk governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market , with subsidies mainly given to working parents . is that a mistake ? should it be more universally available ? julie morgan am : well , some of our provision is universally available in certain areas . for example , the flying start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas , and i think that 's very important , because that does mean that there is n't stigma , and so , in those areas , everybody can take advantage of it , and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it 's reaching those areas . so , i think that there is a purpose behind that . in terms of when you say demand led , could you elaborate on that ? janet finch-saunders am : i know that\u2014we 've just had a useful briefing from david dallimore , and , basically , there is this theory that there are too many resources\u2014the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors : geographic spread in terms of it being more universal , and whether that 's the right way . how do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds , in their own peer or age group ? julie morgan am : it is demand\u2014 nicola edwards : [ inaudible . ] \u2014because the offer is targeted at working parents\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : yes , yes . nicola edwards : \u2014obviously , then the amount of availability is based on how many parents apply for it and take it up . is that the context of demand led in that\u2014 right , okay . julie morgan am : it is universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working , and i think what you 're saying is that it should be available to everybody ."
