    "query": "<s> what did the meeting discuss about universities ' views on the baccalaureate ?",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : okay . we 've got some questions now on how universities view it . hefin david . hefin david am : we 've had an online survey response , which was quite a stark comment , not from the vice-chancellor 's office , but from a member of staff within cardiff university . and it said : 'the welsh bacc is not a fair substitute for a full a-level , and should not be regarded as such . i consider it to be a disadvantage for welsh students , compared with their english counterparts . ' can you reflect on that ? kirsty williams am : i do n't agree . hefin david am : do you think that that 's a view that 's held within universities , and are you concerned about that ? because it is a view that 's obviously held within cardiff university . kirsty williams am : no ; i would say that that is a view held by an individual in cardiff university\u2014 hefin david am : who has influence over students . kirsty williams am : well , that is a view held by an individual in cardiff university . and , actually , cardiff university\u2014indeed , all welsh universities\u2014accept the welsh baccalaureate as an a-level equivalent . i think it is really important to reflect on the wide range of opportunities at higher education that the welsh bac affords individuals . that means that it is deemed as an equivalent to a-level for the vast majority of universities , to get in to some of the most competitive courses , such as dentistry , medicine , veterinary science . so , those courses where we know there 's a high demand and high competition for places , there are institutions that are using that , including cardiff to get into their medical degree . hefin david am : nick brazil , the deputy principal of gower college , said about 50 per cent of the russell group do n't value the welsh bac . kirsty williams am : well , i do n't know where he 's getting that from . i have made it a personal commitment to establish this with universities . i have visited both cambridge and oxford . i spoke again to cambridge , oxford , bath , southampton , st andrews , only last week , who were exhibiting at the seren conference . i specifically took the opportunity to meet with those universities and to talk to them about how they feel about the welsh bac . they have a high regard for the welsh baccalaureate in a variety of ways . first of all , for many of those universities , for many of their courses , they use the welsh bac as an equivalent to an a-level . if they do n't , there are some courses , for instance , where they will lower their offer to gain a place at that university if the welsh bac is passed at a certain level . so , for instance , rather than maybe offering a welsh student a , a , b , they would offer a welsh student a , b , b , plus a welsh bac , thus giving students two opportunities to gain a place at that university , either with or without their welsh bac qualification . even for those universities that do n't use the welsh baccalaureate as a formal part of their offer\u2014and this is the conversation i had again last week with oxford and cambridge\u2014they value it as part of a student 's personal statement ; they value it as part of the interview process in which a student may or may not then be offered a place at that university ; and they also recognise that the skills learnt by students whilst undertaking the welsh baccalaureate are exactly the skills that those students need to make a successful transition from a-level work to university-type work , which , if you can imagine , is very much based on individual research and being able to guide your own learning . so , i just do n't recognise that in some way welsh students are being disadvantaged . the message i get consistently from universities is that there are significant advantages to welsh learners taking this qualification . hefin david am : okay . you can not recognise it , but that is contrary to the evidence that we 've received . i 'm not saying that the evidence is conclusive , but it actually demonstrates inconsistency . so , would you go so far as to accept instead then that there is an inconsistency in the way that universities use the welsh bac as a tool for application ? kirsty williams am : you would know better than anybody , hefin , that universities are autonomous institutions and they set their own methods of entry into those institutions . what i 'm telling you is that the evidence that i have received from universities is that , whilst there is a variety of approaches to how they regard the qualification in terms of offers , consistently , absolutely across the board , all universities tell me that the welsh baccalaureate is a valuable qualification and does not disadvantage welsh students . hefin david am : if the committee were to produce a report based on the evidence we 've received , that would be contrary to what you 've just said . so , i think we 'd end up in a debate in which we are setting out different points of view . so , would you therefore commit to exploring that perspective ? kirsty williams am : hefin , i would argue that i have indeed explored that perspective because i have taken the trouble to find out first-hand\u2014not via my officials , but first-hand\u2014from those institutions , their views . so , this is not something that is hearsay ; i have undertaken to ascertain the views of those universities . we have written to all vice-chancellors\u2014last year\u2014with regard to the welsh baccalaureate qualification . qualifications wales has an individual whose specific job it is to ensure that universities across the united kingdom understand the value of welsh qualifications . that will become increasingly important as we see a divergence between english and welsh qualifications . but i have to say that the evidence that i have from universities is that the welsh baccalaureate , whilst it may be used in different ways in terms of an offer , the consistency from all universities is that it is a valuable qualification . if you 've heard differently from admissions tutors and from the universities officially , rather than from somebody who has e-mailed in , then i would be pleased to look at that evidence , because it would be in stark contrast to what i am being told by universities . lynne neagle am : hefin is not referring to an e-mail\u2014 hefin david am : no , i 've said that . lynne neagle am : \u2014we did do a survey and we 've also taken oral evidence . hefin david am : yes , and it 's representing the evidence that we received . kirsty williams am : and i 'm presenting you with the evidence that i 've received . hefin david am : but it will be presented to you as a submission from this committee , no doubt . let 's look at some admissions offers instead then . you do concede that there is inconsistency with how admissions offers are made with regard to the skills challenge certificate . how would you suggest that that is addressed ? kirsty williams am : hefin , each individual institution and university the length and breadth of the uk have different ways in which they make offers to individuals . what is absolutely clear to me , and if the concern is around the type of institution\u2014 . so , for instance , it is accepted as a third-grade offer in bristol , edinburgh , exeter , lancaster , leeds , leicester , liverpool , the london school of economics\u2014some of the highest performing universities and russell group universities . it is accepted as a fourth qualification or amends the offer in places like bath university , and it is accepted in tariff-point offers in places like hull and the university of the west of england . so there is a variety of ways in which universities use the qualification , and that is their prerogative\u2014that 's their prerogative as institutions . they will have different ways in which they recruit and how they offer places , just like different universities will have different views on unconditional offers . you know , there 's a difference in universities there , is n't there ? some universities do n't have unconditional offers at all ; other universities\u2014 hefin david am : so , what you 're saying is that the problem is n't connected to the welsh bac , it 's connected with just the way that universities make offers , and the welsh bac has got nothing to do with it . kirsty williams am : i \u2019 m saying there is a variety . just like any other qualification , there is a variety in how universities use qualifications for offers . what i \u2019 m saying to you is that , in the conversations that i have had with russell group universities , what they say is that there is certainly no detriment to any welsh student undertaking this qualification . they value the qualification . they think it is useful . it develops a set of skills that help students to make that transition into higher education . and therefore , i think it is a myth\u2014i would go as far as to say that it \u2019 s a myth\u2014that welsh students are disadvantaged in any way by taking this qualification . sorry , andrew . andrew clark : could i just add to that response ? there are , obviously , differences in the way that universities treat the skills challenge certificate and the welsh baccalaureate , which is the prime focus of this . the attitude of the universities has changed significantly since that was a graded qualification . kirsty williams am : yes , that has made a difference . andrew clark : and even those who do not make it part of their offer consider it exceedingly valuable in the way that young people are prepared to go to university and , therefore , as part of their personal statement , as part of their interview , the activity that the young person has taken by means of the skills challenge certificate is definitely recognised , even by those who don \u2019 t actually make it part of their offer . so , we \u2019 re still on a journey\u2014that graded qualification has only been taught for a couple of years , but the journey is taking us to the right place , towards the right destination . hefin david am : okay . so , it isn \u2019 t just about variable admissions practices across universities ; it is to deal with the skills challenge certificate as well , which needed changing in order to improve that . andrew clark : but that was changed in september 2015 . when it was a 'yes'/'no ' qualification , i think they held it in less regard than they do now that it is a graded qualification . kirsty williams am : and that \u2019 s the conversation we had with some of our russell group universities . andrew clark : and that was an important shift three years ago . hefin david am : okay . so , last question , then : are you absolutely confident that any concerns we are offering are nothing really to worry about ? kirsty williams am : we will need to continue to communicate to all audiences the importance of this and the value of this qualification . but i am confident that the university sector , in its wide variety of forms , regards the welsh baccalaureate qualification as a valuable endeavour for welsh students to undertake , and they certainly don \u2019 t regard it as a detriment to students . lynne neagle am : okay . si\u00e2n wants to come in on this , and then i 've got a question from suzy on seren . sian gwenllian am : yes , just that the committee , of course , has been trying to gain evidence on this sector from the universities themselves , but universities wales , which represents the interests of universities in wales , has rejected the committee 's invitation to submit any oral or written evidence . so , can you see the dilemma we 're in ? we are hearing a few things coming from some universities , we hear what you 're saying , but we ca n't get to the root of the matter because the universities themselves are n't willing to come to speak to us . are you also disappointed that they have rejected our invitation to come and speak to us ? hefin david am : where 's the enthusiasm , chair ? where 's the enthusiasm ? sian gwenllian am : and perhaps that 's a sign that they do n't want to be drawn into this argument between the government and us as a committee . kirsty williams am : well , it \u2019 s a matter for individual universities to decide whether they want to participate in the work of this committee . i would urge them to do so . all welsh universities regard the welsh baccalaureate as an equivalent to a-level , and all universities use it as part of their offer\u2014welsh universities . sian gwenllian am : yes , but you see what our dilemma is , though , because if we can \u2019 t actually ask them directly , it 's a bit difficult for us to actually probe this and to help move things on ? anyway , i 'll leave it at that . thank you . kirsty williams am : well , it 's a matter for them , and maybe the chair would like to take that up with universities wales . lynne neagle am : we have had quite an extensive dialogue with them about it . suzy on seren . suzy davies am : so , just briefly , you \u2019 ve said several times that having a welsh bac qualification is an advantage and certainly no detriment , and that it \u2019 s valued by universities . but advantage isn't the same as equivalence , and we have had evidence from\u2014i think it was cardiff university , again , where they had students with two a-levels and a bac who were actually performing as weaker students . so , even though on the face of it you 've got three a-levels , those particular students are n't matching up to the expectations of a student with three a-levels . i do want to challenge what you said about the students who are involved in the seren network about the baccalaureate being accepted for things like veterinary medicine and medicine itself . we 've had evidence from fe colleges , which are now significant players in producing our seren-style students , if you like , that they are exempting their students from doing the bac because it 's a distraction , effectively . what 's your comment on that ? because if this is a question of communication , which i suspect you 're about to tell me , one of the axioms of good communication is you can have the best marketing in the world , but if the product you 're selling is n't highly valued then you 're actually just doubling the problem . so , can you explain to me why fe is exempting their highest flyers from doing the bac ? kirsty williams am : i think sometimes colleges make the decision that four or five a-levels is of an advantage , and therefore , if you 're asking students to carry that workload , which is a considerable workload , that 's the preferred route for more able and talented students . again , what is quite clear in all the conversations that i have had with russell group universities , including oxford and cambridge , is that this is a myth . what universities tell me they want is not necessarily students with four or five a-levels ; they want students with three really exceptional grades at a-level and a welsh baccalaureate . i think that 's really , really an important message to get across\u2014that it is not necessary to do four or five a-levels if you aspire to go to these russell group universities , or if you decide you want to apply to oxford and cambridge . as i said , in the conversations that we have had\u2014and there is actually some research , and i will let the committee have links to the research . there is some research to suggest that those students who have been involved in project-based work\u2014and , of course , that 's not just the welsh baccalaureate , that would be the epq , which is a qualification that is rapidly gaining traction in england . that is an extended project\u2014research based\u2014qualification , very similar to the individual project element of the welsh baccalaureate . the epq in england is seen as a qualification taken by more able and talented students , and what we see in some of the research that is coming forward is that those students who have engaged in that type of work , project-based work , individual-led , research-based work\u2014those skills are the skills that are really attuned to the nature of university-type work . therefore , that is valued by universities and there is some indication to say that there is a correlation between the students who have undertaken that work and their potential success at undergraduate level . they also tell me that there is a link between , for instance , being able then to use those skills to gain work experience , placements and internships in the private sector and in the world of work , because , as i said , those types of skills are really , really valuable and therefore that 's why they value the qualification . suzy davies am : can i just add\u2014 ? it 's great that they 're telling you , why are n't they telling fe ? kirsty williams am : well , as i said , i think it 's really important that fe colleges understand that there is a myth around the fact that these universities are looking for four or five a-levels , and if that 's the reason why then colleges are not allowing students or dissuading students from taking the welsh bac , i think we need to reflect on what 's important to those universities\u2014which is the right a-levels . i think it 's really , really important that students are given the best advice about the a-levels they need to take , facilitating subjects to get into a university , and the value of the skills and knowledge they will acquire through the welsh bac as an assistance to them going forward ."
