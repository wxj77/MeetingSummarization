    "answer": "sian gwenllian am : the bill , in essence , is a simple one , of course , is it not ? but what it does is provide a useful discussion on what good parenting is and what discipline methods are the most effective\u2014that is , discipline methods that parents can use rather than physical punishment . do you think , therefore , that there 's a need to invest much more in programmes to do with parenting and in support services for families in terms of parenting , and that as part of an early intervention strategy that 's more co-ordinated and robust than what we have at present ? julie morgan am : well , we are developing the bill as part of a much wider package of support for children and their parents , which , of course , is already in place . this obviously includes the 'parenting . give it time ' campaign , which aims to help parents do the best job that they can by providing positive tips on parenting and information . and we 're already preparing now to update that , because , of course , that only goes up to age 7 and deals with issues about how you cope with your kids if they 're difficult at meal times and if they have tantrums . it is very well used by parents . but , of course , this legislation will go up to 18 years old , and so the issues may be very different . so , we 're already starting to prepare to update that 'parenting . give it time ' campaign . and then , obviously , there 's the universal services that give access to help and to promote positive parenting , delivered by local government , health , education , social services , social justice and the third sector . we will be encouraging all those agencies that provide that universal service to help support parents and to pass on this information . then , there will be the more targeted supports , such as flying start and families first , which offer help and advice . but what i 've done is i 've asked the officials to carry out a mapping exercise to see where the support is and where the gaps are or opportunities to do more , particularly around information and advice on positive alternatives to physical punishment , but also more widely . so , we are looking to see where the gaps are . i think parents do tend to use information and try to get help in many different ways . a very large number , actually , do use the internet . i was surprised , actually , that so many used the internet to get information . others ask their mothers , their families , their friends , and go to agencies . it 's such a wide range that we need that mapping exercise and we need to see where we need to put in more support . sian gwenllian am : i 'm pleased that you 're going to conduct that exercise , because the evidence that we 've received from a number of different directions is that there is n't enough investment in reality in the support services in the early years , and that there is a real need for the focus within government go back to early intervention and to have a much more co-ordinated strategy . you 've mentioned a number of agencies working on different elements , perhaps , but perhaps there 's a need to bring them all together . you talk about the 'parenting . give it time ' campaign , but i think it 's an online campaign effectively , and flying start\u2014yes , people who attend those courses find them useful , but , of course , it 's not available across wales and it 's not available to every parent . there is a scheme that is available through schools in gwynedd\u2014perhaps you are aware of it\u2014incredible years , with professor judy hutchings , who has been working on this for a number of years now , very successfully , where schools , parents and the children work together on parenting methods that are positive . i wonder if it 's time to think about expanding that as part of an early intervention strategy across wales . perhaps you ca n't give a specific answer today , but may i ask you to take a look at that ? what concerns me is that the bill is going through but there 's not enough work relating to education and having people 's support for different methods , more positive methods , in my opinion , of parenting . there 's a real need to move and to invest in that area and perhaps move money towards that work . julie morgan am : well , certainly , i think that is the purpose of the mapping exercise , to see what is successful , where things need to be expanded , and that 's what we 're going to consider . incredible years\u2014i know it 's very successful ; i am aware of that programme . i think there are patches all over wales of really good progress , but , certainly , i 'm sure we need to give more support to parents in the early years , and i think they 're only too glad to have it as well . children are very receptive at that age and early intervention is the key to many of the issues that we have to deal with later on . sian gwenllian am : okay , thank you . lynne neagle am : thank you . we 're going to return to some of the parenting issues later , but in the meantime we 've got questions from hefin david . hefin david am : just to take it on the next step from what si\u00e2n gwenllian was asking about\u2014in schools , are teachers ready for this legislation ? julie morgan am : on our implementation group , the education sector is represented . they 've come to the first meeting of the implementation group . so , they 're going to be fully involved in the preparation . obviously , corporal punishment was banned in schools a long time ago , and i think the education sector is very supportive of this move . but in terms of the awareness for teachers to be ready for it\u2014obviously , the awareness campaign has got to be aimed at professionals in every field and certainly aimed at teachers . hefin david am : so , if i was a teacher in an individual school , what kind of preparation do you think i should expect ? julie morgan am : you know this better than me , having been more in the education field than me , but i think teachers are updated on different parts of childcare legislation now , and have in-service training days and training courses . and , certainly , perhaps this would be part of that\u2014part of the training that teachers get . this would have to be incorporated into that . hefin david am : one of the things that the national association of head teachers told us was that they would n't want the cost of that kind of training to come from core budgets . would you agree with that ? julie morgan am : well , i would have thought this sort of measure would be incorporated into the training they were using already , actually . i wouldn't have seen it would need something completely separate . hefin david am : so , you think it should come from the core budget that they use for training ? julie morgan am : i think it could be incorporated in what they 're already doing . hefin david am : okay . and do you think that would be a significant additional cost or do you think that that would be minimal ? julie morgan am : i would have thought it would be minimal . they already have training courses about childcare issues , and this would be something that would be absorbed into that . hefin david am : you mentioned the implementation group and the fact that educators are represented on it . can you just be a bit clearer about how they are represented again ? i 'm not sure i caught that . julie morgan am : do you want to , karen , because you were at the group ? karen cornish : yes . so , education are represented on it through the association of directors of education in wales , and they have a representative on the strategic implementation group , and we are working with them to understand who else will be on the task and finish groups that we 're setting up that the minister 's already talked about . and we 've also had conversations with all of the trade unions . i personally went and spoke to them earlier in the year when the bill was being introduced , received their feedback and have said that i will go back and speak with them . hefin david am : okay . the things that are being raised so far\u2014would you say they 're reflective of the concerns that the naht rose about , for example , funding of training ? are those kinds of issues raised ? the practical implications of introducing this bill\u2014are they raised ? if not , what other issues might be raised ? karen cornish : so , i think that the main concerns that you 've already heard as a committee are similar concerns to those that have been raised previously . so , there 's not anything in addition to the things that we have discussed , either with the trade unions or through the implementation group , or during the consultation period . and , as the minister said , for the majority of these sort of things , teachers , education and other workforces already have procedures in place , because this comes under a safeguarding issue at one level . there are procedures and processes that are already there that they all follow . the ask will be based around those safeguarding procedures and , therefore , education and other services update their processes and procedures on a regular basis as a matter of course when any issues like this are addressed . there 's a wider context here . minister , i do n't know whether you wanted to say anything about the well-being and the\u2014 julie morgan am : yes . one of the things that i think this committee has been involved in is we want to have a whole-school approach . we want mental health and well-being to be part of the way that the whole school operates , and the culture and how schools engage with pupils and parents . and we want to create that atmosphere where there 's no wrong door , where children can bring up any of the concerns that they have with any member of the school staff that they trust . and , obviously , the school staff is wider than the teachers . and so , i think the creation of that sort of atmosphere is very important in taking forward this issue . hefin david am : i appreciate that . i think the bill , though , introduces a very specific set of changes that\u2014 julie morgan am : it removes the defence ; that 's all the bill does . hefin david am : but should a parent witness , now , smacking , then it will require a different kind of approach\u2014sorry , if a teacher were to witness smacking , it would require a different kind of approach , perhaps , to existing approaches . there should n't , therefore , be any surprise amongst teachers in how to deal with these things when the bill comes in . i suppose the question i 'm asking is : can we be assured that nothing you 've said today in this meeting , in this committee , should be a surprise to teachers and trade unions , because that would already have been communicated through the bill implementation group ? julie morgan am : yes , well , karen has already said about the meetings that she 's had with the unions and they are present on the implementation group , but a lot of these things happen already . they already have to make decisions about physical punishment they may be told about by children , for example\u2014probably more likely than actually witnessing anything . and they already have to make decisions on those sorts of issues , so i see this as being incorporated in with that . hefin david am : okay . with regard to health and the communication of this to parents , we 've heard about the healthy child wales programme , and the fact that it has the opportunity to play a role in raising parents ' awareness . do you think that 's the case ? julie morgan am : i think the healthy child wales programme and the role of the health visitor is absolutely crucial , because , obviously , the health visitor is there right at the beginning . it 's a universal service , and so there will be great opportunity for them to promote positive parenting in a much stronger way than they 're able to do at the moment , because the fact that you have this defence does mean that the professionals are n't able to make it as clear as they want to make it that positive parenting is the way that they 'd like families to go . so , i think this will be a great advantage to health visitors , and , obviously , they support it strongly , because they 're trying to encourage parents not to use physical punishment now , but with their hands slightly tied behind their back , because the defence does exist . hefin david am : that 's great , that 's a good thing , but the concern we 've got is that half the parents across wales are not accessing the healthy child wales programme , and in my community , within the aneurin bevan health board area , 80 per cent of parents are n't accessing the healthy child wales programme . so , are there concerns that , if you rely too much on that process for communication , then parents , particularly in the early years , will be left out ? julie morgan am : we 've got to rely on a range of ways of reaching parents , and i think that there are other times when there is a much higher ratio of children and families seen . but i think we 've had that discussion with the mapping exercise that we 've already mentioned , that we 're going to identify where there are gaps or where we can do more , and that 's where we will identify this . karen cornish : i think as well that that figure relates to one contact point across the whole of the healthy child wales programme , not the healthy child wales programme as a whole . maybe we could come back with some further information about the contacts , because i'm\u2014 . that figure\u2014 lynne neagle am : the percentage relates to the contact at age three and a half , but that is exactly the kind of age when you 'd expect more children to\u2014 . if they were going to be smacked , it would be at that sort of age , would n't it , really ? so , that is a concern for the committee , really , in terms of coverage . karen cornish : i can appreciate that , although i would\u2014 . midwives , health visitors and others working with families would actually be giving those messages , core messages , about setting boundaries , managing behaviour , discipline , positive parenting , right from the very beginning . so , reliance on that single point of contact at that one age point is not necessarily the most appropriate , because i think there 's a period from birth through to , actually , later as well , when those key health messages , those key messages around positive parenting , are and can be given . as the minister said , we will be mapping a lot of this , but we can give you some more advice on that , if that would be helpful , about the types of messages that are given during that period of time . lynne neagle am : yes , i think that would be helpful . i 've got some supplementaries on this , because i think the committee is concerned that at a key opportunity at age three and a half , a big chunk of families are n't having that contact that they should expect with their health visitor , really . suzy , then si\u00e2n . suzy davies am : thank you . it 's also a time in their child 's life when they 're likely to be spending time not with their parents , in school or early years . and i just wanted a bit of clarification from you , minister , on what you were saying to hefin david about training here . i got the sense you thought this could just be slipped in as a paragraph in existing guidance , but i 'm not clear about what happens to a teacher who is told by a child that they 've been smacked , and they decide that they 're not going to report that\u2014will they get into trouble over that ? if it 's part of a bigger picture that a teacher should have picked up , that 's different , but , if a child tells a teacher , 'oh , mammy smacked me because i did such and such ' , is that teacher going to get into trouble if they do n't report that to the police ? julie morgan am : if that happens now , the teacher is expected to report that now . i think they usually call in social services . suzy davies am : oh , it goes to social services . but that clarity is needed as well . julie morgan am : yes . that is what happens now , so would you expect a teacher to do it , yes . suzy davies am : okay . all right , thank you . sian gwenllian am : yes , i 'm just interested to hear a bit more about the mapping exercise that you 've referred to , which i think is really important , but it is going to show up a lot of gaps geographically , but also in service provision for different groups of families . it 's all very well doing a mapping exercise , but what is the purpose of that , and how are you going to ensure that those gaps do n't exist in future ? maybe we could have a note about what the timetable is for this exercise , and more in-depth understanding perhaps about what your intentions are , and how you intend to take it forward once you 've done the mapping exercise . julie morgan am : yes . we absolutely acknowledge that there is a lot more work to be done , and we know that we have to work hard at this to reach every family . obviously , the information that we 've had about the healthy child wales , the health boards will be monitoring that information and will be\u2014 . i think they 're going to establish a project board to consider the themes that are coming out from the healthy child wales , and so that will be certainly addressed there . and we will absolutely acknowledge that we expect that there will be work to be done . sian gwenllian am : and there will be investment needed , obviously , to fill in those gaps , which means a significant shift in the way government now looks at its budget , and a shift towards that early prevention ."
