    "query": "<s> what did kirsty williams am expect for new examinations and school qualifications ?",
    "answer": "janet finch-saunders am : yes . what are your expectations for how a-level and gcse qualifications will be awarded this summer , following the ministerial direction that you have issued to qualifications wales ? for example , how is an appropriate balance being taken between recognising the progress of pupils in their coursework , mock examinations , and other work to date , and also , the potential of pupils who might have performed particularly well in their examinations this summer ? kirsty williams am : well , janet , i understand\u2014and today is a day where some students would have been undertaking practical examinations\u2014i understand how devastating it has been to both students and teachers alike for the decision i had to take to cancel this summer 's exam series . but i 'm absolutely clear that was the only decision that could have been reached . qualifications wales has made it very clear\u2014and for people who would like more information , i would urge them to look at qualifications wales 's website\u2014how they will go about giving , allocating , and awarding a grade to our a-level and gcse students . firstly , teachers will be asked to submit a grade they believe that student would have obtained , should they have taken an exam . and , of course , teachers will have a range of data and their own professional judgment that they will use in awarding that grade . teachers will also be asked to rank students in order . once that information has been submitted to qualifications wales , there will be a process by which that data will be moderated ; moderated from centre to centre and across the nation , thus giving us the chance to award a student a fair grade whilst being , and remaining , true to ensuring that we have a robust qualifications system , and allowing those students who find themselves at a critical stage of their education , where they are looking to move on to the next stages\u2014that they will have the grades that will allow them to make decisions about their future ."
