user interface : too expensive , yeah . project manager : is it a rabbit ? industrial designer : yes . project manager : do you have a rabbit at home ? marketing : it 's a rabbit with uh broken legs ? user interface : a green rabbit . industrial designer : no . project manager : is it a white rabbit f it 's the white rabbit from the matrix . industrial designer : yeah , exactly . project manager : okay , then yeah . user interface : there , the g white green rabbit . he 's a little bit stoned there . industrial designer : uh i figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit . marketing : yeah . it will do . industrial designer : uh uh uh well . project manager : okay . finishing touch and then we 're going further . user interface : marketing : project manager ? uh project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : where does the pen go ? just uh marketing : have you been uh counting the time ? project manager : yeah , a little . marketing : okay . let 's go on then . project manager : well , i think the dog is the the most uh artistic . industrial designer : uh i figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive . marketing : project manager : do n't choose for youself . industrial designer : oh , sorry . project manager : that 's selfish . okay , now we 're gon na dig into the to the serious stuff . marketing : it 's pretty abstract . project manager : uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half euro . so uh from my point of view , i do n't think it 's uh gon na be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half euro . marketing : project manager : uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million euro . so that 's a lot . we have to sell uh a lot of uh user interface : yeah , how much is it ? marketing : like how much ? user interface : hundred million uh remotes or something ? project manager : uh i think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . user interface : oh yeah . industrial designer : twenty million . two million , oh yeah , two million . yeah . project manager : but our marketing range is uh , market range is international . so we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to . at least that uh countries which have uh a television . marketing : yeah . project manager : um so now it 's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . you can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . what you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . what uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . um so uh let 's uh let 's uh discuss a little . i 'm gon na join you at the table . well what what 's the most uh important thing at a remote control ? user interface : um well i think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . uh project manager : okay . so not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a d_v_d_ and radio and or just only marketing : yeah . i think so . uh but i have some points . can i show them on the on the big screen ? maybe ? project manager : if you have them on uh i can uh marketing : yeah . yeah , i can find uh . project manager : okay . oh , in case you want it this is a dead kind of fly . between the the the , yeah , the the uh user interface : marketing : screen ? project manager : yeah , be the screens . marketing : okay . user interface : is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen ? project manager : no no no . only all the drawings go there , at the left uh user interface : uh but um which the ones we made on the project manager : oh , that pen drawings . uh no , i think uh when it is uh in word and you have saved it in the shared documents folder , you can show it there . user interface : oh , only in word , project manager : yeah . user interface : okay . marketing : okay , i have some uh points from marketing point of view . project manager : yeah . marketing : um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . uh it 's pretty cheap , twenty five euros . uh brand independent . um i think , it does n't have to matter uh which brand your tv or other thing is . um project manager : yeah . okay . five minutes . marketing : five minutes ? project manager : yeah . marketing : okay , i 'll wrap it up quickly . um i personally think it has to be multi-purpose . project manager : yeah . marketing : uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . project manager : yeah . marketing : and uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um maybe some other technology than infrared . uh i rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the tv then you ca n't switch it . um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . project manager : okay . okay . marketing : that might be a little bit uh expensive . um and something like an lcd screen . user interface : for what purpose ? marketing : um uh like i said here um maybe it 's easy . it 's nice as an added feature feature , that um , when you 're on a certain channel , you can see on the lcd screen uh what programmes are coming up or project manager : okay . so it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh marketing : from my point of view , yeah . project manager : remote ? yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? marketing : yeah , it has to be uh yeah , our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things . project manager : yeah . so yeah , i i agree with you . user interface : we marketing : so i i i i project manager : so we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to marketing : to the current market . project manager : yeah . marketing : look , you got some cheap uh remote controls there . they just uh yeah , you got a dozen of 'em . but when you enter a new market with a remote control and project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : uh wan na gain market share project manager : yeah . marketing : you have to do something special , i think . project manager : yeah . but we have to keep an eye that it 's uh at the beginning of such a project , it 's it 's it 's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . marketing : yeah . project manager : uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh marketing : yeah , of course . user interface : and and the price . marketing : but it 's but but this is just from marketing uh aspect . project manager : yeah okay . yeah . okay . marketing : i do n't know anything about user interface or design . user interface : okay . project manager : and that 's because we have him . industrial designer : and and him . user interface : and him . marketing : project manager : okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . so uh you uh will have uh individual actions where i presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . um the the the industrial uh designer has to uh look at the working design . uh the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions . so that 's the thing we uh discussed . user interface : yeah . um one thing uh , project manager : yeah ? user interface : we must first agree on uh what we 're going to m going to make . do we are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? or uh we should have some agreement on that before we project manager : okay . um wha marketing : mm uh i i do n't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . uh industrial designer : i figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . marketing : i think th that 's a pha yeah . user interface : okay . marketing : that 's a phase further . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : ju just uh make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . user interface : ah okay . marketing : and and then we can plan yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : we can plan further , i think . project manager : yeah . but maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh how do you call it ? uh user interface : consensus on the , what we 're gon na do . project manager : uh a little plan on on what we 're going to do . so you do n't uh uh come up with the user requirements who do n't fit the the the the technical functions at all . some basic things we co we want to going to do . uh i think that 's well uh yeah . will come in handy . marketing : mm yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : i do n't know . you decide . project manager : okay . marketing : you 're the project manager . project manager : w he says user interface : if the technical functions have to be designed , i i 've got ta know for what kind of machines they will be . project manager : yeah . user interface : or do we use it a text screen ? or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or project manager : well , th that 's that 's really a step further . but if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that 's a user interface : okay . mm-hmm . marketing : uh tha that 's a same step further . industrial designer : yeah , actually it is . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : then looking at individual components , so that 's actually a f step further . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . and then in the next meeting we decide project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , we can take it from there . marketing : w what it 's gon na be . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah , i agree uh , we can take it from there . marketing : a and then you s then you can delete uh industrial designer : or edit . marketing : the o the obsolete uh details . project manager : okay . so uh marketing : i think . project manager : each individually i individually uh must think on what 's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . and uh then we 're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting . marketing : yeah . project manager : i must finish off now , marketing : yeah . project manager : so it 's over . you uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach . and i see you in uh thirty minutes . thank you . user interface : okay . industrial designer : okay , cheers . user interface : sorry . project manager : be careful . marketing : damn . success ?"
