    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about components of the remote control and what is the conclusion of the discussion ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : okay right , let 's get started . um basically the uh for the um i 'll back actually . for the components design , um next step is basically the the way the remote 's gon na work is still the same idea as before . we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we 're gon na incorporate . then there is a chip and still the sender . so um yes including the power s supply as well . um i 'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , um . there 's a dynamo . any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up um . there 's a kinetic option , which if any of you 've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries would n't have to be replaced . um that 's one option , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but i think that was gon na cost a little more . and then there 's solar cells . um as a final option . for the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , which is oh just to say all all these are um supplied by real reaction . so i guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . project manager : okay . industrial designer : um so for the buttons there 's an integrated push button , which i guess is just the same as the standard ones . this says it 's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer . um there 's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : you could do do that . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . um moving on to the printed s project manager : what would be the cost do do we know ? industrial designer : um that 's on the next i th i think the there was n't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . um which is the next section . basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it 's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : the firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . and there 's different prices according to each . so if we 've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . there 's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , but it would n't affect the size of the remote too much . um and i guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . there is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . um going to my personal preferences , um i thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up . and this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . um for the buttons , i thought we 'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . so if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we 'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . and that 's it . marketing : 'kay . project manager : with the printed circuit boards you were going for the user interface : thanks . industrial designer : um i it kind of depends um if we 're gon na have the speech recognition , we 'd have to probably get an advanced one . i 'm guessing . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh but i do n't know , so that is something i 'll have to look into . project manager : but are we going f r right . industrial designer : um that 's a that 's a decision for all of us . um . project manager : so are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we 're discussing that issue , industrial designer : yeah yeah . we decide . yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so would it not be best to rather than i mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . the other way would be to do the presentation marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and then make the decision at that point in time . industrial designer : um . maybe w user interface : yeah , that 's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . project manager : 'cause at that point then you 've got the details up there , so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue . does that make sense ? user interface : um i have a lot of the information there . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : it might not be very clear . industrial designer : is there user interface : unless you want to plug it back in to yours . industrial designer : um . we could do , yeah . um yeah we should . project manager : industrial designer : as i say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : it did n't the voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . um . project manager : no the scroll wheel required the regular , so the industrial designer : yeah if if you down um . it 's just this bit at the bottom which i 've highlighted , but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , project manager : industrial designer : which is in the higher price range . project manager : okay . the display requires an advanced chip user interface : i think the scroll wheel um project manager : the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense . industrial designer : also the display 's for something else which we decided against . um but that bit project manager : okay . industrial designer : and note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down . project manager : down . user interface : yeah , and if we 're going for sleek and sexy , i think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i i 've got um pictures well i 've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it , project manager : right . okay . user interface : and they do n't really look great . industrial designer : 'kay . so maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the project manager : so . so we 're going for p okay . so is um marketing : so are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ? user interface : yeah , a simple pushbuttons . project manager : simple push button . marketing : okay . industrial designer : did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? the um it was basically what we said before , the idea that you record in a set message , and then it picks up that message um and replies to you . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so it is basically the concept we discussed before . um but then we do n't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . i 'm guessing it would , but got like the definite information . maybe we should go on what we 're certain of rather than project manager : so if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we 're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? or are we going for the regular ? industrial designer : um if it 's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board . project manager : mm-mm . but is there any other i mean okay , that 's true for the for for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration . and so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . s user interface : hmm . but marketing : i suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision . project manager : right . user interface : but the way that i interpret that um it does n't seem to send out a signal to the telly , it just it 's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : oh yeah , i suppose so , yeah . industrial designer : so maybe that would be something separate , yeah . user interface : so i do n't think it would effect our circuit board . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : okay , so we 'd have a simple circuit board project manager : industrial designer : and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : oh that makes sense . user interface : and i do n't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . marketing : yeah . user interface : 'cause the example that they 've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning jo . project manager : mm-mm . user interface : it might be useful to say like where are you remote . here i am , jo . industrial designer : okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : user interface : but i think that 's maybe as far as that one could go ? project manager : okay . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah that makes sense , so we 'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility . user interface : yeah , just as a fun way to find it . project manager : industrial designer : okay . um . project manager : simple circuit board . simple push button . okay . w w kinetic . user interface : and it says that project manager : you were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply . user interface : i think it said the cost of that is n't too much . industrial designer : um yeah i i thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and how does it get uh charged up ? industrial designer : it 's um i think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . it 's um it 's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so you 'd you 'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it . project manager : okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : so the speech recognition was are we going for speech recognition ? no ? 'cause that required the advanced user interface : um i think it would be helpful to find it , but i do n't think it 'd um marketing : just industrial designer : uh yeah i think did we decide it did n't affect the circuit board , it just affected user interface : yeah , i think so . marketing : just just for the call and find thing . industrial designer : it was just project manager : i had speech recognition requires advanced req require industrial designer : oh no th that 's what that 's what i thought , but maybe maybe it does n't . um i think i might have got that wrong . project manager : so okay . marketing : 'cause it 's s it 's separate is n't it , project manager : speech recognition you reckon then is s simple . marketing : it 's not part of the industrial designer : it 's it 's just an addition thing it 's um yeah . project manager : and so we would want it in as an extra because it does n't appear to cost too much . would that be industrial designer : 'kay . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : 'kay shall i pass on to you now ? user interface : i think project manager : in fact , it would n't really cost anymore , would it ? user interface : i 'll just just check what it said . actually i do n't think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it 's already in the coffee machines , so like it 's already kind of marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i assume it would cost extra , but maybe we maybe we 'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . project manager : and then have to change all change everything at the last minute . user interface : project manager : okay . s user interface : um . oh , that was quick . um okay , so very brief presentation , um . from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy . um i have n't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , um but there 's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh . all of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons . does that move it ? project manager : sorry ? user interface : it just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything . project manager : yeah , i 've found that try and get it back . industrial designer : if you right click and then go onto a previous slide . user interface : ah it 's alright . industrial designer : okay , right . user interface : um . there was n't much more to say about that , just rambling . um some of the uh remotes that i looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions . and uh it was quite uh a swish model , where it can control uh four devices , tv , cable , satellite , video , d_v_d_ , audio . um so that 's a bit of competition there . so i mean maybe it 's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control industrial designer : yeah , yeah . user interface : rather than trying to compete with the functions . um the scroll buttons , as you 've already mentioned , um there 's examples of those , but they do n't look as sleek as other models . and there 's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it 's not great . industrial designer : on the price , yeah . project manager : so you were saying the scroll buttons user interface : um yeah . th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um . there was children 's remote , where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : 'kay . user interface : um but i do n't know if that 's really in our field ? industrial designer : i guess i guess we 're going for the biggest market , maybe not , user interface : but that 's something that 's out there . industrial designer : but was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ? project manager : well we 're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that would n't necessarily preclude the one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in you know like a you 'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . but that 's really where your field is . user interface : marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : industrial designer : so maybe the children 's remote should be like a a next step , but maybe i dunno for ours , maybe we should project manager : anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one i 'm reckoning that we 're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : okay . project manager : is that user interface : right well that 's something that we can be aware of . project manager : so so what are we deciding to do here ? user interface : um . i think because there 's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function . project manager : right . mm-hmm . uh the fi yeah , the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . s s so um user interface : oh yeah . different languages might not be compatible . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . it w it would make it quite complicated , where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , 'cause i think you program um this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : yeah and ours is quite a cheap device , so i do n't know how much we 'll be able to put into it . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so you 'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . marketing : yeah . project manager : and you were talking"
