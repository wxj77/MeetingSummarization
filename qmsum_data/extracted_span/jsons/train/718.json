    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about possible detailed designings of remote control ?",
    "answer": "user interface : my original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you this is where it 's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle maybe a hinge that 'll have to be the strongest part of it . if that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , industrial designer : user interface : and then you 'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . thing is inside i think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . um , i dunno , what 's the idea for . just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . it 's looking a bit like something out of star wars at the moment though , to be fair . marketing : project manager : user interface : but yeah . marketing : futuristic . industrial designer : user interface : that was that was a sorta simple idea i had project manager : uh-huh . user interface : and then you know you could about right , it would almost be like a ball . so that was just just an idea i had . i do n't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? industrial designer : right . one problem you 'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it 's stability really , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but of course , since it 's a ball , it 'll roll , so we 'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , user interface : yeah . maybe f yeah . industrial designer : take away that part . that 's one of the big issues . also also you risk the hinges here . that 's that 's um a problem . user interface : yeah , that 's g that 's a good idea . yeah . the idea it did n't have to necessarily be f a hinge , industrial designer : that 's that 's interesting of course , user interface : that was just one idea though . industrial designer : but that 's of course a weak point , yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : project manager : how would we go about um making you know getting rid of our weak points ? what i mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? user interface : marketing : project manager : not to put you on the spot , industrial designer : e no no , project manager : but industrial designer : uh uh . project manager : what did you say your title was again ? marketing : project manager : you 're the the industrial designer . industrial designer : uh , i 'm your industrial designer , marketing : industrial designer : so i b well , project manager : industrial designer : the point is that well maybe i dunno . the shape is perhaps not the most ideal . project manager : okay . industrial designer : as as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . user interface : well i i suppose that things become design . but i mean i marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i was trying to think of like the design of others . i ca n't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , project manager : yeah . user interface : maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there 's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . project manager : it 's not new , it 's not innovative , it 's you know , everybody does long remote because it 's easy , user interface : yeah . project manager : it 's it 's stable um . marketing : 'kay , i 'll draw something . project manager : so if marketing : what ? project manager : no , go ahead . marketing : my idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games user interface : yeah . marketing : l so . but maybe i mean that would be kinda big and bulky . we could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . i do n't know . that 's my idea . user interface : i think definitely doing something different marketing : yeah . user interface : is a good idea . i mean maybe design something , that 's sort of like suppose not everybody 's everybody 's hand 's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . project manager : something with a grip . marketing : mm . yeah . user interface : yeah , with a grip . project manager : yeah . because even i suppose even with the ball user interface : it still might be hard to project manager : it 's user interface : it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . project manager : it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . so perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . user interface : like yeah . project manager : but then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we user interface : yeah . marketing : true . user interface : it 's d yeah . i think it 's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . project manager : i feel like i 'm just shooting everything down here . user interface : marketing : that 's fine . project manager : uh um marketing : you 're the boss , you 're allowed to . industrial designer : well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . so if the remote is too small it marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : if it 's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . so for that there 's project manager : okay , so industrial designer : so project manager : unfortunately we 've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . um we 've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we 've got a couple ideas um . let 's see here . what if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . so you know um s so it 's easier to hold onto that way . user interface : yeah . project manager : course that 'll then remove some of our our ball . unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . so the grip is no , that would n't work either um . but if we 're gon na make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here i guess , um and then flat uh and then we have the problem with the hinge . so if we 're flat on the bottom , it 's not gon na roll away , it 'll stay where we want . industrial designer : the question is also , i dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? project manager : mm , that 's true . industrial designer : it 's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so i do n't know if a lid is a good idea . from stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . so it 's do n't make it too stable uh . project manager : so we do n't have it flip open . we just have a ball user interface : but then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . industrial designer : to the other design . project manager : okay , so then we forget the ball . industrial designer : it looks cool . marketing : looks cool though . project manager : it looks cool , but it 's really not it 's not functional um . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : uh functional . project manager : so we 've got our sort of keyboard kind . what if we flipped it around here , so that it were um sorry , that does n't look anything like what you had there . um so it 's up and down , you hold it this way . user interface : yeah . project manager : course then it 's it 's like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . marketing : industrial designer : right . right . project manager : but it 's one-handed um . industrial designer : question is what makes those game pads functional ? w i think that 's pretty much the form for full hand . so it 's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : right , makes it nice , so that 's the essential part . except for that i think we 'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design . project manager : yeah . marketing : right . industrial designer : 'cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : you know , all project manager : because it does n't have a cord , like joysticks do . industrial designer : that dif batteries right , and batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wan na control with it , right ? so , have to m show which is the front , which is the back ."
