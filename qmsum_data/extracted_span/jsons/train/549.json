    "answer": "marketing : okay . go right to my first my next slide . project manager : uh okay . marketing : um alright , my method is uh i 'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wan na see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so i 've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . i s i spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . and then when i 'm out um in people 's houses or at meetings or anything like that , i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it 's convenient in the conversation i ask about it . and i would encourage you all to do the same . um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . um people like something that really fits in their hand . user interface : 'kay . marketing : simple is beautiful . they do n't want to have to squint at small print um , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , and they do n't care for the mode thing . they want each button to do something . and eye-catching is important . it 's got ta look cute , it 's got ta look appealing . go ahead , i 'm trying to finish fast for you . um and our preference is , as far as i 'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item . and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . if we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we do n't get anywhere . so we 've got ta narrow our selection down to li two things , i think , that we gon na say are really great about our our our new product . and i 've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular . and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . they are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . so those are things maybe we wan na look at as far as saleability of the item . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : okay ."
