    "answer": "project manager : i 'll get back to my thing then . uh okay , back this up to the screen . so i got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet , nowadays people do n't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either well , i do n't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it . user interface : yeah . project manager : but i do n't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example . just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . it 's not important anymore . um we 're targeting young people now , because our um this is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , which are um the younger people were defined under forty . marketing : yeah . project manager : i so i think it 's that 's also good with the fashion and everything , so yeah . marketing : yeah , and they want to pay for it project manager : they want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . marketing : and uh project manager : if they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they 're actually gon na spend uh spend money on it . marketing : with more where with more technical specifications project manager : yeah . marketing : in the project manager : see how far we can go with it anyway , so marketing : yeah . project manager : and one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow , but i 'm not sure if we i think we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody 's taste . so with that concept i started thinking , so why not just steal nokia 's idea and just make changeable covers for your i mean those cost hardly anything i think , and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design . and sell the covers separately , for example . that 's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . so you do n't have to i think you do n't have to make entire remote controls . we make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : so that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . so just i 'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . would you like to share ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : no , i think this is a good idea . project manager : okay . industrial designer : but marketing : but oh ? user interface : is it manageable ? is it easy ? industrial designer : go ahead . marketing : yeah , with with an lcd screen you can project manager : oh yeah . i think we should lose the lcd screen , industrial designer : y yes , i think so too . project manager : like you said . i think for example it 's it 's huge i think the lcd is huge , user interface : yeah . marketing : why ? nokia w project manager : it consumes batteries like hell . i think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . user interface : and it costs too much to fabricate , project manager : it costs a lot , i think . user interface : so we 're on a tight budget here . industrial designer : okay , uh project manager : what we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an lcd screen but with a preview , marketing : okay . project manager : but y i 'm not sure if it 's even possible . for example , a little tv guide . like you have a little just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . project manager : so you can use your remote as a tv guide . i 'm not sure it 's even possible , industrial designer : hmm . i have to check that out , project manager : but maybe okay , make it industrial designer : i 'm not sure . project manager : yeah , find a little compromise in that , but what did i write down ? marketing : yeah . project manager : i think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your tv industrial designer : that must be possible . project manager : and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . i think it 's easy to implement , we should go for that . industrial designer : i 'm sorry , project manager : uh speech recognition . user interface : and it 's industrial designer : whe where do you wan na hit the t_ you wan na we want a button on the television . project manager : i thin yeah , i mean where else should you put it ? industrial designer : in th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : because that 's not possible uh . project manager : but how are you gon na use that if your i mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gon na press where are you gon na press the button ? industrial designer : uh . yeah . exactly . user interface : maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . project manager : a slap-on sticker . oh , you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your tv . marketing : mm uh . project manager : yeah , that could be possible . user interface : yeah , exactly . project manager : a little little box you can attach to your tv is fine then , okay . industrial designer : okay , then uh i 'd i 'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that 's uh determines everything i 'm gon na do . project manager : i think it 's universal . i think we should go for universal , industrial designer : if not project manager : because apparently we 're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . industrial designer : okay . project manager : i think universal remote control should be possible . marketing : yeah . um industrial designer : okay , then i go for that . marketing : everyone uh wants to buy it , so we w project manager : yeah , i think we 're targeting everyone , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so remote industrial designer : okay . no , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it 's fine with me , but then i know what to look for . project manager : okay , universal is good . speech recognition , i think it 's very hard , because we 're selling across multiple countries . so i think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it 's very hard to do . marketing : yeah . or one . user interface : and it 's marketing : or when you say one two uh i it uh it 's enough , project manager : yeah , but i do n't see arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever . marketing : right ? but oh yeah . user interface : besides that , the technology is n't really super yet , so that is a problem in implementing this . project manager : it 's yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's not a mature technology , i think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , marketing : okay . project manager : so user interface : it 's a good idea , but it 's just not i do n't think the market 's ripe for that yet . project manager : i do n't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . industrial designer : uh-huh . project manager : what else do we have ? marketing : yeah . project manager : um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . so the the the symbols wo n't fade , industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : maybe a little harder plastic industrial designer : exactly . project manager : or especially li we do n't industrial designer : i already noted that . project manager : maybe we do n't have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , so those always fade first . industrial designer : mm , okay . okay . project manager : mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . let 's see . industrial designer : if we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . project manager : for example ? industrial designer : that 's fo is uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language . project manager : well , we 're not we 're not targeting older people , marketing : yeah . project manager : we should remember that . everything we target is under forty , industrial designer : that 's okay , okay . project manager : you assume that that they read correctly and i think they 're the most important thing about young people is that they 're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , so industrial designer : uh okay . user interface : but should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the project manager : no , of course . no , i think it 's just something you you put over them , because yeah we c yeah , you ca well , tha that 's not a that 's not a bad that 's not even marketing : but every user interface : that 's a problem with the with the text then . project manager : it 's not even a bad idea . i mean , for example , if you 're if you 're into the durability issue you could user interface : project manager : for example , if your buttons are faded , after i mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . uh i 'm not sure it 's it 's hard to make . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so it 's a good and a bad idea . industrial designer : uh but i know that the buttons are like a nokia telephone on uh one sleeve , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so you do n't have to change your whole cover . uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . user interface : oh yeah , i know what you mean . industrial designer : know what i mean ? it works the same as a nokia telephone , it 's it 's in my uh 'kay . project manager : yeah , i know , it 's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . yeah , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : exactly . project manager : that 's what i something i have to look into . either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , i 'm not sure which which is easier , industrial designer : hmm . project manager : so um anyway , yeah , this is what we 're gon na do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let 's see what we let 's see we so you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . i want some you should do some trend-watching , because even if we 're if we 're gon na do those covers and everything , what people really want , that 's what we need to know in this phase , marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : because that 's gon na be the essential final design that we 're gon na come up with . marketing : okay . project manager : um yeah , i think user interface is fairly obvious . i mean it should be very intuitive , user interface : pretty straightforward . project manager : s yeah , it should speak for itself . uh for example i bought a remote control last week with a new tv , it was it l it 's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , industrial designer : project manager : and i 'm total tv new , anyway . so i think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever , they 're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your tv . user interface : is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , project manager : industrial designer : yeah . user interface : because we 're working with different types of television , so we 're going to work with that ? project manager : that is true . industrial designer : i do n't think so . project manager : no , that 's true . industrial designer : no , i do n't think so . because the television needs to respond to the signal , project manager : yeah , that 's true . user interface : it 's an in-built menu , industrial designer : and if it does n't know how , it 's user interface : is n't it ? yes . industrial designer : exactly , that 's not possible . user interface : so basically project manager : i 'm not sure if it 's impossible , user interface : we project manager : but uh there 's a chance it 's not , so . user interface : or we could use a double-sided for less used functions project manager : a double-sided remote control ? user interface : you project manager : i do n't think that 's useful . user interface : yeah , with the cover . i it 's basically an idea to overcome these issues , project manager : yeah , but then you 're gon na have a lot of wasted buttons . user interface : because project manager : for example you have a sony tv and the half of the buttons wo n't function if you have a for a sony that wo n't for a philips tv . user interface : no , but basic functions marketing : yeah . user interface : but functions which are not frequently used . project manager : i do n't think we should user interface : because if we use a universal remote control , we 're going to have to have most buttons on it , project manager : yeah , for exam user interface : so project manager : i 'm not s marketing : mm yeah . project manager : yeah , for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their tvs , not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , but you ca n't you can not take into consideration all the different brands of tvs . industrial designer : but that might be broken . project manager : i think there 's i think there is a standard for example between uh industrial designer : hmm . project manager : because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands . especially the big ones , the big brands , industrial designer : hmm . hmm . project manager : so . 'cause everybody i have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so i think i 'm not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it 's possible . uh i think just a b industrial designer : mm okay . project manager : and the navigation is very basic , it 's usually the same thing . industrial designer : mm . but i think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . for instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that 's in it . project manager : yeah . yeah , that 's true . i think so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : because otherwise you 'll lose functions by buying our marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , i think it 's possible , just the way how to . industrial designer : okay , i thi i think so too . marketing : yeah , yeah . project manager : yeah , then then you could do everything i suppose , because usually the tvs have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it 's okay . industrial designer : and i think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . for instance uh sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . project manager : yeah . yeah i think it should be a little distinct from everything else , industrial designer : we should not do that . project manager : because it 's either it 's both mayb industrial designer : exactly . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , project manager : maybe the shape can be a little different . user interface : i have some ideas . i have some ideas . project manager : maybe it 's a little more curves or whatever . industrial designer : mm that 's your uh division . marketing : um yeah . and uh with different colours uh . project manager : so um user interface : i 'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that i have . project manager : yeah , this . not sure what marketing : okay . project manager : because we have forty minutes , i 'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so . user interface : i heard a beep go . project manager : yeah , but it was n't me , it was him closing something ."
