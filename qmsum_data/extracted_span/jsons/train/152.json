    "answer": "hon . michael chong ( wellingtonhalton hills , cpc ) : thank you , chair . parliament 's now been suspended for three months , since friday , march 13 . will the government commit to reopening the house of commons with its full powers , with social distancing , on monday , september 21 ? the chair : the honourable minister . hon . pablo rodriguez ( leader of the government in the house of commons ) : mr . chair , as my colleague knows , we 're meeting here four days a week , with questions on any topic for an hour and 35 minutes instead of 45 minutes a day . democracy is as important for us as it is for the opposition . hon . michael chong : mr . chair , this committee is neutered . it has no powers to introduce supply day motions , no powers to test government confidence , no powers to do the usual things that parliament does . at times of crisis , the bedrock principles of rule of law and democracy are tested , and our democratic principles are buckling under the pressure from this government . they came to office promising greater transparency , but they broke almost every one of their promises . they broke their promise on electoral reform . they appointed an anti-conservative organization , unifor , to the media bailout fund . in the last parliament , they tried to give the pmo control over this legislature in motion no . 6 , and in the last election , they rigged the leaders ' debates in their favour , and now they have suspended parliament . instead of this neutered committee that meets for only a few days with a few members , will the government commit to the full re-opening of this house with all its powers with social distancing on monday , september 21 ? hon . pablo rodriguez : mr.chair , the government 's objective is always to try to resume parliament as it was before . today , we have to live with this pandemic , but we will do everything we can to return to a normal situation as quickly as possible . that is clear and precise . the opposition asked for more time , especially to ask questions , and that is what it got . i would like my colleague to tell me one thing . over the past few weeks , we have sent suggestions to opposition members about the operation of parliament and they have never responded . i would like to know why . hon . michael chong : mr . chair , the full parliament with its full powers sat through two world wars , previous pandemics and the october crisis in 1970 . the governments of those days did not seek the suspension of the house . the government is not only failing to defend democracy here but also abroad . it ca n't utter the word taiwan . it is failing to be strong and clear on hong kong and , while the situation today is not that of decades past , it is clear that canada in the past stood for the rights of people in hong kong . canada needs to take much stronger diplomatic action on hong kong . there are some 300,000 canadians living there , and they are looking for the government 's support . when will this government act ? when will it threaten economic sanctions like the u.s. administration has ? when will it provide asylum and a clear path to citizenship like the u.k. government has ? when will it speak up against the communist party of china 's united front workers operating here in this country ? when will it do like australia did in calling for an international investigation of covid-19 , and organize an international coalition of like-minded democracies to defend hong kongers and the violation of the sino-british treaty ? the chair : the honourable minister ."
