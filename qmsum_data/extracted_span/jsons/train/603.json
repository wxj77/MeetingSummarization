    "answer": "the chair ( hon . anthony rota ( nipissingtimiskaming , lib . ) ) : i call this meeting to order . welcome to meeting number 22 of the house of commons special committee on the covid-19 pandemic . a reminder to all members that in order to avoid issues with sound , members participating in person should not also be connected to the video conference . for those joining via video conference , i would like to remind you that , when speaking , you should be on the same channel as the language you are speaking . as usual , please direct your remarks through the chair . i understand we do n't have any ministerial announcements today , so we 'll proceed to presenting petitions . i would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions . for members participating in person , we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificate off at the table once the petition is presented . the first petition will be presented by ms.may . ms. elizabeth may ( saanichgulf islands , gp ) : mr . chair , it 's an honour to rise in meeting number 22 of the covid-19 committee , otherwise known as something like the house of commons . i 'm here to present two petitions containing hundreds of signatures on the issue of the treatment of falun gong practitioners by the people 's republic of china , particularly the practice that 's alleged of involuntary organ harvesting . the petitioners ask the government of canada to condemn this practice and to publicly call for an end to the persecution of falun gong in the people 's republic of china . the second petition is from residents throughout saanichgulf islands concerned about what was , at the time this petition was submitted , a future problem . it remains an issue , and i present it on behalf of petitioners who wish the government of canada not to put public funds into purchasing or maintaining the trans mountain pipeline or towards any expansion of the pipeline . the chair : next we 'll go to ms. kwan . ms. jenny kwan ( vancouver east , ndp ) : mr . chair , i rise to table two petitions . the first petition deals with the covid-19 situation . the petitioners note the pandemic is having a devastating impact on many canadians nationwide , especially those who have low to modest income , small business gig workers , freelancers , artists , film industry workers , non-salaried workers and individuals on fixed incomes such as seniors and those on disability . it further notes that rent , mortgage and utility payments are due at the end of each month , putting countless canadians at risk of losing their housing . it is paramount there be safe self-isolation opportunities for all individuals in this country . to that end , the petitioners are calling for the government to immediately enact a nationwide rent freeze , eviction freeze , mortgage freeze and utility freeze , enforce mortgage deferrals for homeowners without penalty or interest charges from financial institutions and provide direct assistance in the form of a monthly , universal , direct payment of $ 2,000 per month for all , with an additional $ 250 per child immediately . the second petition deals with the trans mountain pipeline expansion . these petitioners join the hundreds of thousands of people who are opposed to the expansion . trans mountain , in building the pipeline , brings massive environmental and economic risk with no substantial benefit to british columbia or to local residents . approximately 40,000 barrels of oil have already leaked from existing kinder morgan pipelines , including two major spills in burnaby since 2007 . i might note , mr . chair , that just this past weekend there was yet another spill to the tune of 1,195 barrels here in british columbia . there is no known scientific technology to clean up the bitumen when there is a spill , and the number of tankers would go from eight to 34 per month into the burrard inlet . it puts at risk many residential neighbourhoods and the traditional territories of at least 15 first nations . the chair : may i interrupt for a moment , ms. kwan . i want to remind all members in the house that when presenting a petition , the idea is to be as concise as possible . ms. kwan , i 'll let you wrap up , please . ms. jenny kwan : thank you , mr . chair . the petitioners are calling for the government to immediately act to prevent this new oil pipeline from proceeding through british columbia . the chair : thank you . we 'll now go to mr. genuis . mr. garnett genuis ( sherwood parkfort saskatchewan , cpc ) : mr . chair , i have four petitions to present today . the first petition reflects the outrage of my constituents at the ever-expanding order in council from the government banning more and more firearms . in particular , the petitioners highlight the failure of the government to act on the issue of illegal guns . the petitioners note that virtually all violent crimes committed in canada , including the recent shooting in nova scotia , involve illegal firearms in the hands of those who are already not permitted to possess them . the petition has two asks . first of all , it asks that we reverse the order in council banning certain firearms , but also that we propose measures that will effectively address the illegal use of firearms by criminals while respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens . it also asks that we ensure that substantial changes to firearms laws in future actually be made by parliament , not by the government acting in an unaccountable manner . the second petition deals with bill c-8 , which is the government 's bill around conversion therapy . the petitioners support efforts to ban conversion therapy . they express concern about problems in the wording of the definition used in the legislation . they 're asking the government to support amendments to fix the definition to address the issue of conversion therapy and ensure that the definition is correct and does n't criminalize certain forms of counselling that individuals may voluntarily enter into . the third petition is regarding bill s-204 , a bill in the senate that seeks to make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad to receive an organ without consent , dealing especially with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking in china . the petitioners are supportive of bill s-204 and want to see it move forward . the final petition is with respect to bill c-7 . there 's been much discussion in this house about the need to do better in terms of long-term care . rather than working to do better in long-term care , unfortunately we 've seen the government removing vital safeguards in the area of euthanasia . i think our focus should be on assisting life rather than removing safeguards that are required in association with the euthanasia regime . the petitioners are particularly concerned about the government 's plan to remove a 10-day reflection period that normally takes place . that period can already be waived under certain circumstances , but bill c-7 proposes to remove it entirely as well as reduce the number of witnesses involved . the petitioners are quite concerned about what 's going on in bill c-7 and call for it to be stopped or amended . the chair : presenting petitions . we 'll proceed to statements by members . we 'll start off with mr. manly . mr. paul manly ( nanaimoladysmith , gp ) : mr . chair , we are in the midst of a global pandemic and an economic shock . recent events have ripped open the wound of systemic racism in our country . racialized and marginalized communities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic . thousands of seniors in long-term care facilities have died . it is clear that we need system change . in the past , governments have bailed out banks and corporations because they were too big to fail . it is time to bail out humanity and the planet . no one will be immune from the threat of climate change and mass extinction . both are the result of the exploitation of the natural world in the name of the economy . humans created the economy . we can choose to change it . we must protect our environment or perish . covid-19 has demonstrated that together we can take courageous action for the common good . we need to do the same for the climate crisis , because humanity and our planet are too big to fail . the chair : we 'll now go to mr. spengemann . mr. sven spengemann ( mississaugalakeshore , lib . ) : mr. speaker , today marks world elder abuse awareness day . underestimated and under-reported , elder abuse exists across the world . at risk of neglect and assault , many of the most vulnerable older persons reside in our long-term care facilities . they are the seniors who have built our country and shaped our communities , who have shown us resilience , courage and selflessness , who have made us stronger , and whose work and teachings continue to inspire us . they are parents and grandparents , brothers and sisters , friends and mentors . we have not been there for them in the same way they 've been there for us throughout their lives . the canadian forces report , alongside the climbing disproportionate death toll in our long-term care facilities , has reconfirmed the ugly , indefensible reality of elder abuse and neglect in canada . in my community , we mourn the deaths of 68 seniors from one long-term care facility alone , camilla care . we must make the same unwavering commitment to older persons as they have shown to us . we must protect and uphold their human rights . we must do better . the chair : before proceeding , i just want to bring up to the members in the background that we want to keep it as simple and as parliamentary as possible in keeping it neutral . we 'll now move to mr. barrett . mr. michael barrett ( leedsgrenvillethousand islands and rideau lakes , cpc ) : during these trying times , the residents of leedsgrenvillethousand islands and rideau lakes have risen to the challenge . they 've made sacrifices and gone above and beyond to make the lives of their neighbours better and to keep our communities safe . it would be impossible to list everyone who has emerged as a community hero , but i 'd like to highlight a few , like lily , an eight-year-old from elgin who raised funds for her local food bank by building and selling squirrel picnic tables , and louise boardman from spencerville who 's making masks for long-term care facilities and selling others in support of the breast cancer action centre . the knights of columbus in prescott raised funds and are distributing some $ 27,000 in support of charitable groups throughout the region . the knights of columbus in kemptville are working overtime operating the local food bank . who can forget our top-notch health care workers like hannah and mary at the brockville covid-19 testing centre ? it is the people of leedsgrenvillethousand islands and rideau lakes that make it so great . to everyone working to make a difference and to all of our essential workers , thank you . the chair : next is mr. anandasangaree . mr. gary anandasangaree ( scarboroughrouge park , lib . ) : mr . chair , the indian act enshrined racism into canadian law in 1876 , and , through residential schools , the child welfare system , our legal system and our police , we criminalized and tore apart indigenous peoples . the deaths of chantel moore and rodney levi and the assault on chief allan adam are recent examples of systemic racism within the rcmp . sadly , the rcmp leadership has failed to acknowledge this reality and its root causes . these same systems negatively impact black canadians . anti-black racism has resulted in more young black men being jailed , children being streamed or excluded from schools and negative police interaction due to profiling . black lives matter . no single canadian is responsible for the prevalence of systemic racism ; we all are . collectively we build institutions that discriminate based on race . it is now time to reimagine and rework our institutions , starting with our police , to ensure that all canadians can achieve their truest potential . the chair : ms.larouche , you have the floor . ms. andranne larouche ( shefford , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . june15 is world elder abuse awareness day . i want to remind members of the link between abuse and the problems of economic dependency among seniors . improving their purchasing power means reducing the risk of them falling victim to abusive people . that 's why the increase in the old age security benefit and the guaranteed income supplement must be extended beyond the pandemic . in three weeks , our seniors will receive their first cheque , when they should be receiving their second . a date must also be announced for the new horizons for seniors program , which helps several groups develop projects to break the isolation of seniors . in closing , i would like to mention the organization justice alternative et mdiation that during the pandemic , along with other organizations in shefford , has set up the project une histoire pour la tienne , which also serves to mark this day . it 's a virtual meeting between young people and seniors , allowing them to exchange some inspiring life experiences . since age prejudice is very much present , i applaud this project , which aims to make us understand each other better and judge each other less . the chair : we 'll now continue with mr. sangha . mr. ramesh sangha ( brampton centre , lib . ) : mr . chair , in the time of this terrible crisis affecting all canadians , when we are all thinking about how best to deal with it , let 's all think about the people around us . let 's show our representation not only to those in the sector of sanctioned workers , but also to all those canadians who day by day stand up and make a difference . every day i am proud of the reactions of canadians to this crisis . i want to acknowledge and celebrate all the contributions made by the people of brampton centre , all religious institutions , civil society and community organizations like knights table in my riding . we are all standing together to fight covid-19 . let 's continue working hard with that same spirit to get positive results out . thank you very much . the chair : i will proceed to mr. ruff . mr. alex ruff ( brucegreyowen sound , cpc ) : mr . chair , whether graduating from elementary school , high school , georgian college or graduating from colleges or universities across the country , i am proud of the accomplishments of all the graduates across brucegreyowen sound . i would also like to congratulate and thank all the teachers and parents who have adapted to teaching online or from home and who have supported these graduates over the course of their academic careers . i 'd like to extend special congratulations to cameron lovell , who just graduated from grade eight , as well as to neebeesh and neebin elliott , originally from the nawash unceded first nation on the bruce peninsula , who will be headed to michigan state university , and to jared lumley from owen sound , who just graduated from my alma mater , the royal military college of canada . the college motto of truth , duty , valour is something all canadians should aspire to live by . i wish all the best to these graduates on their next adventures . i and canada can not wait to see how their dreams and goals impact and change the world . i congratulate brucegreyowen sound graduates . the chair : we 'll now go to mr.cormier . mr. serge cormier ( acadiebathurst , lib . ) : today i pay tribute to richardlosier , an entrepreneur , visionary and builder who died on june9 , 2020 , surrounded by his family . mr.losier is a giant in the acadian peninsula business community . in1968 , he co-founded st.isidore asphalte , a company that now has more than 200employees . he also launched many other businesses over the years . he was unifying and generous , a philanthropist who cared about young people and never missed an opportunity to improve their lives . i met mr.losier when i was 14years old , and i can say that he has been a positive influence in my life . every time i met him , he gave me a lot of advice and encouragement , which i 've never forgotten . mr.losier 's legacy to his community is invaluable . his commitment remains an example for all of us to follow . mr.losier now joins his wife , nolla . i offer my most sincere condolences to his children , richard jr. , ronald , nathalie , caroline and stphane , and to his family and friends . rest in peace , mr.losier . you will be greatly missed . thank you for everything you 've done for our region . the chair : we will now go to ms. dabrusin . ms. julie dabrusin ( torontodanforth , lib . ) : hello from my community in east end toronto . people talk about how a city the size of toronto can be cold , but that 's far from the truth in my community . i want to give a shout-out to our teachers , like mr. wong of earl grey senior public school , who delivered home-baked cookies and handwritten notes to all of his students , or monsieur steve , who 's offering online french classes , or the teachers of riverdale collegiate , who paraded through our streets to celebrate our graduates . our local michael garron hospital put out a call for community members to sew masks and received over 60,000 masks , including those made by lisa tancre of chartwell avondale retirement residence . michelle beaton organized a front window scavenger hunt to entertain children and their families . restaurants , even while facing adversity , have been generously donating food , like the members of the leslieville bia or mezes . there are so many more stories of generosity that i could share , but i 'm out of time . i thank everyone who has stepped up . we all appreciate all of their hard work . the chair : we will now go to ms. sahota . ms. jag sahota ( calgary skyview , cpc ) : mr . chair , on saturday night , calgarians , particularly those in the northeast , in my riding of calgary skyview , witnessed a devastating storm , the likes of which i have not seen in my lifetime . homes , vehicles , community buildings and structures suffered significant damage due to large hail , floods and high winds . people acted quickly to seek shelter . i 'm so grateful that there have been no reports of personal injury or loss of life . i went around the community yesterday to survey the damage . it is extensive . my heart aches for those who have been impacted by the storm in an already incredibly difficult time , but we are resilient . we know that in the coming weeks there will be a lot of cleanup required , both to personal property and in the community . i know my constituents , and we will help one another get through this together . i will work hard to do everything i can to help rebuild this community . the chair : mr.serr , you have the floor . mr. marc serr ( nickel belt , lib . ) : thank you , mr.chair . i 'd like to express my sincere gratitude to the people of west nippissing who organized pride activities to celebrate the lgbtq community in june . this week , we are also celebrating national public service week . i thank the public servants for their dedication to the nickel belt community and the valley east and rayside-balfour areas . the chair : next is mr. saroya . mr. bob saroya ( markhamunionville , cpc ) : mr . chair , when covid-19 began spreading across ontario , markham , like many other communities , was unprepared . our front-line health care workers did not have enough personal protective equipment to do their jobs safely . when markham residents heard about these shortages , my office was flooded with calls from people who had ppe and wanted to donate . since then my office has been able to deliver tens of thousands of ppe supplies to front-line health care workers and five masks to each family in need . this pandemic has shown that no matter what the challenge is , the markham community will overcome it . today , i would like to thank the front-line health care workers who are doing incredible work . i would also like to thank all those who have helped in markham 's hour of need . the chair : i understand we had a bit of a glitch there . i 'm sorry . with the pause , we thought that was the end of it . mr.serr , i would ask you to continue . i understand you started to switch languages . please continue . you have 30seconds . mr. marc serr : thank you . i 'm switching to english now . thank you to our nurses , doctors , pharmacists , cashiers , janitors . thank you to various retail workers and first responders dealing with covid-19 . you keep our communities safe and healthy , and you feed us . your dedication and sacrifice are greatly appreciated . as we start to see local businesses reopen , it is important for all of us to remember to follow best practices outlined by local public health . our front-line workers deserve our respect . it is important for all of us to respect social distancing , to protect all workers and their families . together we can remain strong and united as we continue to face this challenge together . the chair : again , my apologies for skipping over there , but now we 'll to to ms. mcleod . mrs. cathy mcleod ( kamloopsthompsoncariboo , cpc ) : mr . chair , in commemoration of italian heritage month , i would like to pay tribute to the colombo lodge and italian cultural centre in kamloops , british columbia . the colombo lodge was founded in 1914 and is an integral part of our community . recently they began colombo cares take-home dinners with proceeds distributed to different non-profit organizations throughout the region . last month they very generously gave away hundreds of dinners to royal inland hospital staff and paramedics for their tireless work throughout the pandemic . in their own words they say , colombo lodge is very proud of the italians that have made kamloops their home . community members of italian ancestrypast and presenthave helped and continue to help kamloops prosper as a giving , welcoming and inclusive community . personally , i want to thank all members for their friendship and generosity over the years . our community is forever grateful for their kindness . the chair : we 'll now proceed to mr. harris . mr. jack harris ( st. john 's east , ndp ) : mr . chair , many newfoundlanders and labradorians are facing a serious financial crisis . most people with disabilities are waiting to be included in the liberals ' promised program . fish plant workers will need support to avoid a disastrous year . many small businesses do n't qualify for programs . municipalities need emergency help to meet the crisis . people are worried about what will happen when the cerb runs out in two weeks ' time , and the coming tourism season looks very grim . the province itself is in serious financial crisis due to the pandemic and the decline in oil prices . the federal government must overhaul and enhance the fiscal stabilization program to help newfoundlanders and labradorians and other oil-producing provinces through this crisis . both the province and the oil and gas industry players have committed to net zero emissions by 2050 . this is a challenge and an opportunity to transition to a sustainable energy future , but it will require significant investment and support by government to keep the industry strong and make this a just transition for workers . much has been done . much more needs to be done . the chair : ms.gaudreau , you have the floor . ms. marie-hlne gaudreau ( laurentideslabelle , bq ) : mr.chair , all 44elected municipal officials in the riding of laurentideslabelle and i have sent a letter to the government asking that cellular and high-speed internet networks be made available to all . the crisis has accelerated the demonstration of the need for these networks in daily life . the territorial complexity of the laurentians means that there are areas where the signal is weak , unstable or non-existent . there is an urgent and essential need to change the infrastructure of the current networks . also , because of the lockdown , internet failures are being felt , and they prevent distance learning , telemedicine and teleworking , among other things . how can our municipalities develop economically if they ca n't provide their community with adequate communication tools ? we are therefore calling on the government to put the interests of its people first by investing massively right now in the construction of high-speed internet and cellular infrastructure . the chair : mr. waugh . mr. kevin waugh ( saskatoongrasswood , cpc ) : i rise today to pay tribute to sir winston churchill , the former prime minister of great britain and one of the greatest leaders history has ever known . in what can only be called a lifetime of service , churchill 's contributions to the commonwealth and to the world are without equal . during the second world war he led the allied forces in europe against the tyranny and fascism of adolph hitler and his nazi regime . when our world was in its darkest hour , churchill 's leadership was a beacon of hope and freedom . i am reminded of something he once said , all the greatest things are simple , and many can be expressed in a single word : freedom , justice , honour , duty , mercy , hope . sir winston churchill himself embodied all of these great things and will forever be a symbol of freedom , democracy and hope . the chair : mr. gerretsen . mr. mark gerretsen ( kingston and the islands , lib . ) : mr . chair , i would like to add my voice to the recognition and celebration of pride month , which is celebrated annually during june . pride month is important for canadians because we can be proud of who we are and celebrate our diversity . this june is different from previous years as we can not celebrate in person all together . however , i know the ongoing pandemic will not stop us from showing our love and support for the lgbtq+ community . to celebrate pride month this year , my office distributed 3,000 pride maple leaf pins across the country ; whoever asked received one . although the majority was sent to constituents in my riding , over 500 pins were sent to the neighbouring ridings of lanarkfrontenackingston , leedsgrenvillethousand islands and rideau lakes , and hastingslennox and addington . it warms my heart to see so many canadians showing their support . happy pride , everyone . the chair : we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers . please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to substitute for each other safely . mr.deltell . mr. grard deltell ( louis-saint-laurent , cpc ) : mr.chair , i am very pleased to take part in today 's meeting of this parliamentary committee . canada has been dealing with the covid-19 pandemic for three months now . the situation now seems to be improving , although we must remain vigilant . economically , business people and the entire canadian economy depend on government decisions . my question is very simple : when will the economic update take place ? hon . chrystia freeland ( deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs ) : mr.chair , i thank the hon . member for his question . i agree with him that canada and canadians are doing an excellent and difficult job in the fight against coronavirus . as for the economy , our government is there for canadians , for workers and for businesses , and it will continue to be . mr. grard deltell : canadians , business people and businesses want to know where the government is headed . when will the economic update take place ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , canadians know that the government is there to support them . eight the chair : we return to mr.deltell . mr. grard deltell : canadians and quebeckers also know that the government of quebec will table its economic update this week . why is n't the federal government doing the same ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i 'm pleased to explain to hon . members and to canadians what the government is doing for the economy the chair : we return to mr.deltell . mr. grard deltell : mr . chair , it is a real pleasure for me to explain to the minister and everybody in the house of commons that today the saskatchewan government will table its economic update . why ca n't ottawa do that ? the chair : the honourable deputy prime minister . hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , i 'm delighted to have the opportunity to share with canadians what our government is doing to support workers , businesses and the economy . eight million canadians have received the cerb , essential support for canadian workers and their families . the chair : we 'll now go back to mr. deltell . mr. grard deltell : mr . chair , 11 days ago the newfoundland government tabled its own economic update . we see governments acting correctly for their people , except for the liberal government , which can not table an economic update . when will the liberal government table an economic update , which canadians would like to see ? the chair : the honourable deputy prime minister . hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , i am delighted to share with the member opposite and with canadians what we are doing practically that has meaning for canadians . let me talk about what we are doing for canadian businesses . nearly 670,000 canadian businesses have received support the chair : we 'll go back to mr. deltell . mr. grard deltell : in canada , the quebec government will table its economic update this week . the saskatchewan government tabled its economic update today . the newfoundland government has tabled its economic update . everybody is working hard in canada , and the business community would like to know where the liberal government is going . the question is crystal clear . when will the liberal government table an economic update ? the chair : the honourable deputy prime minister . hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , canadian workers and canadian businesses want to know that our government is here to support them . i have shared with this house our support for canadian workers through the cerb . i 've spoken about the ceba , and let me point out that more than $ 26 billion of support has been given through that essential program . let me talk about the wage subsidy . more than 2.6 million the chair : we 'll return to mr. deltell . mr. grard deltell : mr.chair , this is starting to get interesting ; the minister is revealing some of these expenses . could the minister tell us how much the government has spent in the last three months ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i will continue in french by explaining what our government is doing for canadians and workers the chair : mr.deltell . mr. grard deltell : mr . chair , this is a little bit concerning for all canadians , because this government can not say when they will table the economic update , can not identify how much money they have spent in the last three months and can not say what is the deficit of canada . is somebody in this government running this country correctly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , absolutely we are running this country , and we are supporting our economy . in fact , we appreciate that canada currently is experiencing its greatest economic crisis since the great depression . that is why we have devoted nearly 11 % of gdp to support canadian workers and canadian businesses . i want to assure canadians the chair : we 'll now continue with ms.normandin . ms.normandin , you have the floor . ms. christine normandin ( saint-jean , bq ) : mr.chair , there are times when quebec and the provinces are not just two solitudes , but they get along and speak as one , such as when the time comes to tell the government to mind its own business . on reading section91 of the constitution act , 1982 , which sets out the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government , nowhere do i find that the federal government must meddle by attaching conditions to health transfers . it is quebec and the provinces that hire the medical personnel , doctors , nurses and caretakers . it is quebec and the provinces that are responsible for purchasing the necessary equipment . it is quebec and the provinces that know what is happening on the ground and what their needs are . will the government do the only thing within its authority , which is to take the cheque , sign it and put it in the mail ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i thank the hon . member for her question . we fully understand the importance of federal support for the provinces , especially in our national fight against the coronavirus . i agree with the hon . member that we must give financial support to the provinces , including quebec absolutely . i would also like to point out the importance of the support of the canadian armed forces , who are doing an important and excellent job in quebec and ontario today , right now . ms. christine normandin : mr.chair , i am glad to see that there is recognition of the importance of transferring this money . my question is whether it can be transferred unconditionally ; that 's what i 'm asking . there 's a state of emergency . in the past , we have seen that it takes a long time to negotiate conditions with the federal government . we saw it in the case of the quebec city tramway , and we are still seeing it now in the case of transfers for housing in quebec , for which there is no agreement and , therefore , no transfer of money . will the federal government send the money free of conditions ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , the hon . member said in her first question that the only thing the federal government had to do on health care was to sign the cheques . i ca n't agree because , today , at this time , at the request of the premier of quebec , the men and women of the canadian armed forces are in quebec today ; they 're there to save the lives of seniors the chair : we now return to ms.normandin . ms. christine normandin : it was indeed at quebec 's request . what i 'm saying is that , at present , the provinces are unanimously asking that there be no conditions . it 's urgent that the money be transferred . the federal government 's job here is to sign the cheque and send it to the provinces . the government 's job is also to make parliament work . this is where there should be negotiations so that we can work , among other things , to send money to people living with disabilities , to make sure we fight cerb fraud and to make sure that court time limits are effective in the current crisis . can the government focus on the issue in order to respect the provinces and transfer money for health care ? hon . chrystia freeland : i thank the hon . member for her question , mr.chair . i agree with the hon . member that the women and men of the canadian armed forces are in quebec today at the request of the province of quebec . that said , i hope that the hon . member will agree with me that being there for quebec 's seniors , that saving the lives of quebec 's seniors , is much more than simply signing cheques . i am very proud of the work the women and men of the canadian armed forces are doing . i think we all should thank these people who are working for canada , for quebec , and who are doing an important and excellent job . ms. christine normandin : mr.chair , i think the deputy prime minister misunderstood me when i was talking about the importance of acting quickly . negotiations between the government and the provinces take an awfully long time because the federal government decides to place conditions where there should n't be any . right now , the only important thing is to transfer the money quickly so that it can be used in our hospitals and our long-term care facilities , where the need is desperate . quebec and the provinces know exactly what their needs are . hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i would like to point out the extent to which the federal government is there to support the provinces , including quebec . we have increased funding to the provinces and territories by $ 500million to help them prepare for covid-19 outbreaks . this funding is in addition to the $ 40billion that we already provide annually to the provinces and territories . that 's a lot of money . it is strong endorsement the chair : we 'll now go to mr. singh . mr. jagmeet singh ( burnaby south , ndp ) : mr . chair , systemic racism is killing people . it 's killing black people and it 's killing indigenous people . recently , rodney levi was another victim of systemic racism . he was killed in new brunswick by the rcmp . to deal with systemic racism , we need systemic change . will the liberal government commit to systemic change so that not another life is ever taken again ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , i thank the member opposite for the extremely important question , and i 'll take this opportunity to acknowledge the work that he has done for many years fighting racism in canada . our government absolutely acknowledges that systemic racism exists in canada . it exists in all of our institutions , including the police and the rcmp . i agree with the member opposite that now is the moment to fight this the chair : mr. singh . mr. jagmeet singh : mr . chair , i thank the deputy prime minister very much for the response , but there are some specific actions we need to take . there are movements . black lives matter , as a movement , is calling for the defunding of police . what they 're saying is we need to make better choices with how money is being spent . when someone is in need of a wellness check or a mental health check , money , financing and support should go to mental health workers and health care workers , not the police . is the government prepared to fund and prioritize health care workers over the police ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , the member quite rightly began his questions by speaking about systemic racism against indigenous people in canada , and i would like to speak about that for a moment . i spoke to perry bellegarde this morning , because it is such a crucial issue . we can describe it as the original sin of our country . i absolutely agree that we need root and branch reform , including in how policing is done in canada . mr. jagmeet singh : mr . chair , will the liberal government commit to a review of the use of force as outlined for the rcmp ? will the liberals commit to that change ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , the prime minister and the minister of public safety had many conversations last week with the rcmp . we all accept that the chair : we 'll go back to mr. singh . mr. jagmeet singh : mr . chair , will the government commit to ensuring that de-escalation receives priority ? hon . chrystia freeland : let me continue , mr . chair . systemic racism exists in all of our federal institutions , including the rcmp . it 's time to put an end to it . let me just say the chair : we 'll go back to mr. singh . mr. jagmeet singh : mr . chair , i 'm not getting an answer . will the prime minister or the liberal government commit to something simple and ensure that at the federal level , racial profiling , street checks and carding are expressly prohibited ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , sadly , i ca n't agree that rooting out systemic racism is going to be simple , but i can agree that racial profiling is absolutely inappropriate . it is not something that we should the chair : we 'll go back to mr. singh . mr. jagmeet singh : well , i 'm going to try to get another commitment from the government , because they do n't seem able to commit to something as clear as ending racial profiling . we know that millions of canadians in a couple of weeks are going to be faced with the reality of their cerb ending . these families are worried about how they 're going to put food on the table , because they ca n't return to a job . will the liberal government commit today so that those families will have some concrete support , yes or no ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , let me be clear , as i was in my previous answer , that our government clearly is opposed to racial profiling . this is a wrong practice and we 're very clear about our position there . now when it comes to the cerb , i absolutely share the concern of the member opposite . the canadian economy is in its direst state since the great depression . we know that all the jobs have not yet come back . we know that canadian workers , canadian families , continue to need"
