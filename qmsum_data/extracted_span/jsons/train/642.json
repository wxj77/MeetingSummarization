    "answer": "the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll now go to the honourable member for wellingtonhalton hills , mr. chong . hon . michael chong ( wellingtonhalton hills , cpc ) : mr . chair , the house of commons is shut down . let 's be clear . this is not the house of commons . it 's a committee where only statements , petitions and questions are allowed . there is no power to introduce motions , to test confidence or to vote . the government came to office promising greater democracy but they broke their promise on electoral reform . they tried to give the pmo the control over this house in motion 6 , and yesterday 's report confirms that they rigged the leaders debate in their favour in the last election . now they 've shuttered parliament . parliament sat through two world wars , the october crisis and previous pandemics and it survived the test , but not now . the people 's representatives need to sit . people need their representation . parliament and this house of commons with its full powers needs to reopen and it needs to reopen now . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable member for reginaqu'appelle . hon . andrew scheer : mr . chair , these past few months have been tremendously difficult for so many canadians : sickness , losing loved ones , job losses , economic hardships , loneliness and isolation . the pandemic has taken its toll on so many . it is in these times of suffering and adversity that we have seen canadians coming together to support each other and that brings us hope . mosques , churches , synagogues and gurdwaras have all answered the call to help their communities . whether it 's providing meals to the hungry , clothing for the cold , or technology for those who need it most , these actions are true reflections of the kindness and generosity that canadians are known for . while there are too many groups to mention them all , i want to thank vikas sharma and care4cause out of brampton for the meals that they have been providing their community in that area and across the gta . this group and thousands of others like it across the country are working tirelessly to ease the suffering of others and help those in need . thank you , and god bless all the volunteers ."
