    "answer": "user interface : yeah . well uh s function of remote control is just just you know , change channels is its main function . project manager : so we want it to be um a tv remote or i i mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? user interface : oh right . i suppose you c try make it a universal remote project manager : 'kay . user interface : for could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person 's house . but , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . industrial designer : project manager : mm-hmm . 'kay . user interface : i think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like i do n't actually know . but is it just infra-red ? is that standard ? project manager : i i think yeah , yeah , r universal remote . user interface : ye yeah . project manager : um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , marketing : huh . project manager : so marketing : ours too . user interface : project manager : i think we 're all in the same boat here . um user interface : um one thing i thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . project manager : okay . user interface : so if there 's a g a way of finding it quite easily , i thought that 'd be quite good quite a good feature . marketing : mm . ch project manager : so we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh marketing : like a tracking device ? project manager : like a tracking device or or like a a user interface : oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise project manager : it makes a noise , user interface : and it 'd beep . project manager : there 's a button on the tv that you press industrial designer : mm , mm . project manager : and user interface : yeah . industrial designer : right . project manager : 'kay . marketing : be good . industrial designer : so user interface : generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . project manager : yeah . do we want user interface : just long . project manager : so they 're kinda like long and rectangular . user interface : yeah . project manager : do we want something crazy ? user interface : black usually . project manager : you know , we want something new that 's gon na stand out . user interface : yeah . marketing : lot more modern . project manager : a m a modern so our remote should be user interface : i think so . maybe sorta spherical or something . a ball . industrial designer : marketing : maybe like user-friendly , like a little user interface : yeah . marketing : you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . user interface : people i thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball , project manager : 'kay . user interface : and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . industrial designer : well there are of course certain restrictions , you ca n't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here . um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . what are we gon na build that thing out of ? how sturdy is it gon na be ? do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? project manager : okay so yeah , so we want it to be sturdy , user interface : yeah . project manager : we want it to to hold up to somebody 's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , user interface : yeah . project manager : then it user interface : it could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside ."
