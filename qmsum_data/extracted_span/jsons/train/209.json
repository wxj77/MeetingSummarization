    "answer": "project manager : so hello . marketing : good afternoon . sorry i 'm a little late . project manager : no problem . marketing : got stuck in the traffic . project manager : okay . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : that 's possible on uh this time of day . starts at three o'clock . uh marketing : yeah . project manager : uh , let me see . our fourth and last meeting . there he is . yes . okay this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we 're going to close the project today as well . so after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : project manager : and this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . um , in order to do that we have this agenda . we 'll have the prototype presentation first . then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . then we will look at the finance . uh we will have to see if everything we wan na do is also possible within our budget . because everything costs money , and the more functions you wan na have the more money it will cost . so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote . but we will see that later . then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that . industrial designer : project manager : we 've got forty minutes . so we will be finished at half past three . but first um we will do the this is prototype presentation . so , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward . industrial designer : okay . well this is what me and richard came up with . the default spot for the on-off button . the mute button just below that . then there 's the volume and channel selectors . simple plus-minus button . uh we thought of a help button . if you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the lcd screen . then there 's the zero to one to zero buttons . a button for teletext . a button for the subtitles . and the company logo . so it 's rather simple prototype . and uh we 'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it . project manager : okay . marketing : um , is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? user interface : so yeah . yeah . industrial designer : sure uh just pop in at any time . marketing : um , when you 're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . user interface : uh , that 's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh so um you put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred . now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and you but you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . s so uh the shifting uh button . uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . so marketing : okay . okay . um yeah . project manager : okay . uh but um i thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . uh just a few buttons and large buttons . user interface : oh yeah ? project manager : but uh i think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . so i 'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons . user interface : industrial designer : i think if you look at most controls , they 've got more buttons than this . project manager : that 's right . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and well the on-off button , it 's it 's a necessity . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you ca n't drop that one . the volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . so we could cancel that one . i think the help button really is necessary user interface : yeah yeah . industrial designer : because there 's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . user interface : uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh project manager : long time . yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : if you put user interface : but m yeah . we disc discuss that already . but uh we think uh old people uh do n't know that uh option . so uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh project manager : yeah . okay . industrial designer : well , you ca n't leave out the number buttons i guess . project manager : yeah . user interface : and uh project manager : uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . industrial designer : and yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so it 's rather basic already . marketing : yeah . think so . that 's what i pointed out earlier . if you just make a control for just the tv there 's just not much to gain here . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . so we had somebody about th interfa something about the design of the buttons there ? industrial designer : yeah , they 're project manager : just n normal plain buttons . user interface : yeah . yeah , industrial designer : it 's rather hard to draw on the white-board . user interface : it industrial designer : but they 're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . project manager : yeah . 'kay . user interface : yeah yeah . just to recognise it , so uh industrial designer : just for recognition . user interface : uh yeah and now we do n't need uh leds or um y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also , but um uh because we use the little display we do n't uh have to use it . uh so project manager : yeah . okay . industrial designer : so and for the materials we 've just chosen for rubber buttons . with a a different colour than the case . so they jump out . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and uh that 's about it . project manager : that 's nice . then because we only have thirty minutes left , i will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it 's all possible what we wan na do . and i can tell you that we 're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros . marketing : project manager : if we see i do n't know if i 've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . i counted two batteries . but maybe we can also use one . i do n't know if it 's possible . marketing : since it rechargeable . project manager : it 's rechargeable . that 's right . user interface : yeah we can u just uh project manager : okay . that 's two euros off . user interface : 'kay . project manager : we need the advanced chip . so there 's not much to uh to save there . here we have the single curves . uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro . um , i do n't know , but i think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . user interface : yeah . project manager : i think we have to keep that . user interface : yeah . project manager : then we have the case material supplements . it 's plastic . it 's the cheapest one we need . so that 's uh not much to save either . but then the biggest costs are the buttons . so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . user interface : okay . project manager : because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end . um , user interface : yeah . project manager : so if we let 's fir first count the buttons we have now . user interface : uh sixteen , i believe so . project manager : because i sixteen . nah , that will be even more then . eighteen euros . so , user interface : uh seventeen . uh with the help button . project manager : seventeen . industrial designer : marketing : um project manager : okay , including the help ? marketing : damn . project manager : yeah . uh seventeen . user interface : yeah . project manager : i think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long . marketing : user interface : . project manager : that saves us uh one euro already . 'cause then we have got fifteen i think ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : would n't project manager : fifteen buttons . marketing : yeah . no . that would n't be an option . project manager : and this is marketing : uh , d i assume you 'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ? project manager : no those are one , i think . user interface : yeah . where did uh marketing : well , think actually there 're two buttons , user interface : uh , it 's just one button . marketing : are n't they ? user interface : but , um yeah . there were uh two uh for one big button . but they are uh more expensive than the small ones . uh , yeah . so project manager : yeah but th it 's not stated in this files . user interface : it 's just a . project manager : so maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing marketing : well i was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . project manager : that 's possibility as well . marketing : that would cut the cost . project manager : so and it 's good for the design as well . so you can make uh let 's see . if you make this looks a bit like uh a cross . plus . min . user interface : but i do n't do n't know if if it 's cheaper . project manager : uh s yeah channel . user interface : so uh , project manager : yeah w user interface : we 've still got four buttons , but just um so project manager : yeah th i think they count uh the materials . user interface : you got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um project manager : yeah on the chip there . yeah . user interface : yeah . on the chip you 've got still uh four uh four buttons . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : that 's right . that 's right . user interface : so project manager : but i think because we have the advanced chip marketing : yeah . project manager : we can just count this as one button . user interface : yeah , but marketing : but , i think this really is four buttons anyhow . project manager : but no but i think yeah . maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it 's impossible to get the twelve and a half euros . also the l_c_ display , i think it 's , i think it 's too expensive for the display we use . industrial designer : uh that 's that 's a big cost . project manager : i think they uh try t industrial designer : if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . project manager : that 's right , but what 's the big advantage of our remote then ? marketing : only the docking station , i guess . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : which is n't the the docking station is n't even in this c s schematic . so it 's not even taken into the price . project manager : that 's extra . that 's extra . that 's right . marketing : maybe we should to a different supplier . project manager : that 's an option . marketing : yeah . project manager : poland . something . polish supplier . do n't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well . industrial designer : we we could save money on it . but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ? user interface : . marketing : yeah , that 's what i 'm wondering . industrial designer : my mother ca n't even send send an s_m_s_ message . project manager : yeah . that 's a point . industrial designer : so user interface : are we gon na buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ? marketing : um user interface : so um yeah . we m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or ca n't uh go um industrial designer : yeah . marketing : well , since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it 's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . especially since we have those nice features . project manager : yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros . we do n't have any more budget to develop it . user interface : is it impossible to industrial designer : the margin will get too small . yeah . project manager : yeah . so user interface : but it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty . project manager : it is . if you leave out the l_c_ display . and if you use less buttons . say or you can take the single chip . user interface : i do n't think so . marketing : it would be a be a pretty rigid one . user interface : s yeah . marketing : user interface : but , you ca n't use uh project manager : there it is . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : but then w good looking . user interface : uh , wi with n oh , with uh attractive uh o options . project manager : yeah . user interface : so uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . so project manager : i think it 's uh difficult as well , but marketing : basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . industrial designer : no remote . project manager : or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . then w user interface : scroll-wheel 's one . industrial designer : that 's project manager : because then we save ten buttons . user interface : no , it project manager : then we have five and one . user interface : yeah . project manager : and and see . if we have this one and we 've got the advanced w uh , we 're getting close . industrial designer : we 're getting closer . user interface : yeah . marketing : but how does scroll-wheel work here ? project manager : then you will or maybe you can um scroll . if you scroll you will see the numbers on the lcd display . until you 've got the right number , then you push it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . integrated scroll-wheel push-button . project manager : alright . it 's got ta scroll and push . okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well . marketing : but yeah . industrial designer : you could just not scroll for a half a second . project manager : yeah . that 's right . so if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . industrial designer : so you wo n't need a button . marketing : i think that would be like the end of our usability . project manager : but it would definitely crop cost , a lot . user interface : d yeah . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , but project manager : and we need the battery . and the regular chip is not possible ? it has to be advanced ? industrial designer : if you want to use an lcd screen you you need an advanced chip , yes . project manager : it has to be advanced . yeah . okay . and we can save a euro by a flat design . that 's an option we can user interface : ja ja . project manager : then we 're almost there . industrial designer : yeah if you v could just leave out one more button . project manager : yeah . so if we user interface : yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah but i think that 's that is a big advantage , user interface : so yeah project manager : if we 're user interface : yeah it 's a big advantage . project manager : but user interface : but um , it 's project manager : can we use ca n't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? user interface : uh , yeah . industrial designer : i think so . yeah . project manager : if you push it three times ? marketing : well , think it 's pretty much the teletext subtitles are user interface : yeah . marketing : right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and teletext disappears . but the subtitles stay there . user interface : but if you push the teletext button twice industrial designer : what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? eight hundred eighty eight . marketing : i think that 's the case on most user interface : it 's uh one m uh one b uh , a few buttons . project manager : ah that 's not really that marketing : well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . industrial designer : yeah . okay . marketing : but then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who do n't even know what a scroll-wheel is . user interface : yeah . marketing : holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . industrial designer : marketing : with only five buttons on it . and a scroll-wheel . project manager : i think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . if you just make it real simple . because it saves it saves a lot of money . and we can keep our lcd screen , which can provide extra information . how to use the scroll wheel . how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . marketing : true . true . project manager : and it 's good for the innovative design as well . if you would erase these . mm eraser ? and we put uh looks a bit odd maybe . marketing : that 's a pretty big scroll wheel . project manager : that is something like that . marketing : project manager : then , yeah . we 've got the scroll-wheel . one , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . and these are two buttons then . industrial designer : we could make two buttons out of that . and just um if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so that would save two buttons . if you do the same for the channel . project manager : yeah . that 's really a good good idea , i think . and it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . industrial designer : more obvious . project manager : so we make one for the volume , one for the channel . plus scroll . that 's right . industrial designer : so if we project manager : so we 've got one , two , three . yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . that 's m that 's better . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . so marketing : so this is five buttons . industrial designer : if we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . and make it smaller overall . project manager : y yeah . industrial designer : so if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button project manager : mm yeah . uh yeah , and then you can industrial designer : you get a a much smaller remote . project manager : that 's right . user interface : uh yeah . industrial designer : and it sh project manager : so we can decrease this one to four buttons . industrial designer : yeah ? marketing : right now we have five . user interface : but uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . project manager : yeah . that 's no problem . user interface : just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . it uh it 's a bit uh project manager : yeah . yeah . it 's uh it 's more the moulds in which they are being made , i think . single curved is really easy to just fill in . and cases come right out of the machine . user interface : . project manager : and single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one . i think this is a really easy one . um , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? freek , what do you think ? marketing : well , i still think we should go for the single curve design . user interface : . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but then again , all these changes are not really okay with me . industrial designer : richard 's argument was very good . yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : but since we just have to . project manager : we have to cut costs . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah i 'm ag marketing : i 'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote . project manager : ask for more money . yeah . yeah . i am agreeing with the usability . yeah . marketing : or do some market research and see what the options are . project manager : yeah . but th um i think we can then keep the single curved one . just to express our lcd screen a bit more . marketing : yeah . project manager : so people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , user interface : yeah . project manager : it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . it will be necessary to have good help function , as well . so this is scroll . i think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . before we went on to the to the whole design . marketing : yes . definitely . user interface : the th project manager : but i 'm glad we could make a bit . marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one . marketing : it 's pretty different . user interface : marketing : but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . this will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . project manager : yeah . it will . yeah . user interface : but um marketing : 'cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . this is not familiar for them . project manager : no , but i think marketing : so we 're gon na have to do a lotta convincing them . project manager : i think the most user interface : but they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . project manager : that 's right . marketing : yeah . project manager : we can let l user interface : so maybe it 's uh project manager : we can stick it out , a bit . like a old old buttons . user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : maybe that 's recognisable for them as well . yeah . that 's a good one . user interface : yeah . project manager : so , i 'm afraid we have to move on . and it 's uh it 's b uh less frightening , i think . if they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh but we will see . user interface : yeah . marketing : that 's true . might uh might be confusing too . project manager : yeah . that 's definitely right . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : they 'd be like , what ? only five buttons ? project manager : yeah . user interface : but very special , so uh project manager : i would buy it . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : yeah . but you 're not sixty . project manager : that 's right . i would buy it if i was six . no i do n't know . what it costs under twelve and a half euros ? no ? uh , yes they are . industrial designer : user interface : no . project manager : no . but we can go on with the project evaluation . industrial designer : marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : let 's see . i can sit down i think . we still have fifteen minutes left , so we 're nice on schedule . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um , the project process . marketing : so um , i like set up all these criteria . and evaluation of the thingy . project manager : evaluation criteria . that 's right . that was the the point i forgot . i should industrial designer : project manager : there we are . evaluation criteria . user interface : marketing : thank you . project manager : go ahead . industrial designer : project manager : we 've got five minutes i think for those criteria . marketing : five more minutes ? project manager : no we 've got fifteen minutes but marketing : okay . project manager : uh yes . what ? marketing : 'kay so i did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . project manager : uh yeah . marketing : translated it into criteria , which would be these . um , is the remote fancy ? the shape , look and feel . innovative ? what new functions are there ? uh , easy to use ? uh , learnability is a very important factor here . uh , is it functional ? are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? and are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? and the cost . the target group . is the remote really for the group we 're making it for ? and recognability . if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? and so we 're supposed to evaluate it right now . project manager : okay . marketing : let 's see . oh i have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . project manager : yeah , that 's because my pen failed to upload his data . user interface : mm . yeah ? marketing : okay . project manager : i tried to marketing : interesting . project manager : but it 's uh it 's giving errors by downloading the software . marketing : so user interface : mm . 'kay . marketing : is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? project manager : i think it 's fancy . yeah . six . user interface : uh six . yeah . marketing : we all go for six ? good . um , is the design innovative ? project manager : very . user interface : mm . sh marketing : i think so , with our lcd screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . project manager : subtitles , buttons . yeah . seven . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : seven ? project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : so we 've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ? industrial designer : user interface : marketing : should be do-able . project manager : yeah . that 's right . marketing : is the design easy to use ? user interface : mm . not really . project manager : that 's a bit dodgy . marketing : well would be for us . but user interface : for old people i i project manager : i would say four . four or five between . between four or five . industrial designer : four or five . yes . user interface : yeah . four . marketing : i 'd go for four , too . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : is it functional ? industrial designer : marketing : is the design functional ? um , do we have all functions that we want to include ? user interface : n yeah . industrial designer : marketing : i think we do . do we have too many functions ? i do n't think so . it 's pretty slim . project manager : think it 's uh seven . marketing : seven . oh , and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? like it getting lost and r_s_i_ influences ? industrial designer : mm , we have n't thought of that one . project manager : it was . marketing : think we do . project manager : i had them worked out . mm . they are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost . user interface : yeah . marketing : are the production costs within the preset limits ? industrial designer : marketing : well they are now . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : does the design fit the group of focus ? user interface : mm , th yeah . industrial designer : i think that 's a three . marketing : yeah . project manager : no i think with our new radio button , i think it 's uh i think it 's better . marketing : i think it does n't . user interface : yeah . uh we have to test it s but marketing : i do n't know . industrial designer : i still i think it 's too m too fancy . too too flashy . marketing : i think project manager : i think it marketing : i think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control . user interface : uh , yeah , true . project manager : yeah . i would give it a four . marketing : i 'm not sure . i think i 'd go for two . user interface : i go for three . so project manager : then we have to do the three . it 's the marketing : 'kay . is the company company recognisable ? project manager : yes it is . user interface : yeah yeah . marketing : well , we have the logo there . project manager : yeah . marketing : so project manager : and they wan na put fashion in their products . uh in the slogan of the company . and we have the removable front cases . so , i think it 's very recognisable . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . so that will be this . i was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this . project manager : we 've got a calculate it . mm ? industrial designer : twendag sieven an twendag . marketing : is this like after this , are we done ? or project manager : n we 've gon na we 're going to evaluate it . marketing : we 're gon na go to our other room again . well , anyhow . these are seven factors times seven is forty something . two ? no . project manager : forty nine . marketing : nine ? uh , minus one . minus three , minus four . minus four . so that would be minus eight . forty one out of forty nine . project manager : forty one . that 's around eighty percent . marketing : okay . project manager : what is it ? marketing : guess i 'll just type that in on the bottom here . project manager : that 's eighty four percent . i think that 's a pretty nice score . user interface : hmm . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : hmm . 'kay . so that will be the evaluation . project manager : thank you . so , that brings us to the project evaluation . yep . thank you . marketing : project manager : project process . did we move through the right phases , you think ? along the process ? user interface : yeah . but it marketing : think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . in the design phase . user interface : yeah . project manager : that 's right . so lack of information about prices . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . that 's true . marketing : yeah . definitely . project manager : okay . uh okay . satisfaction . was there room for creativity ? no ? user interface : marketing : not too much . no . project manager : it 's because of the finance sheet . yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh marketing : yeah , true . but project manager : the room was yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and i would 've liked to go for the younger users also . user interface : . marketing : and just to be able to access internet and get something of your own . project manager : restrictions . internet access . 'kay . leadership . was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ? yeah ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : teamwork ? did it work out ? working together ? also , you two of you with the uh last phase ? user interface : so industrial designer : yes , was okay . user interface : yeah . project manager : nice . industrial designer : the tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it 's very easy . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : tasks . okay . were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ? or were they too much ? industrial designer : well , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but the digital the digital pen is very nice . user interface : marketing : project manager : smart-board . user interface : yeah . project manager : if it wants to download its uh data . user interface : but marketing : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : yes . yeah . user interface : uh project manager : failed download . smart-board was irritating . so you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? or something else ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : a flip-over or a more precise uh digit user interface : a flipper 's uh easier , so yeah . project manager : faster as well , i think . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . flip-over . user interface : but if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it 's easier to uh share it with uh other people . uh so uh project manager : yeah . user interface : you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory . marketing : yeah , user interface : so so marketing : i tried to open the file on my laptop , user interface : yeah ? no ? industrial designer : no . did n't work . marketing : but not possible . project manager : uh you need a smart board uh application i think . marketing : yeah . project manager : but i think you can user interface : t can uh can you export it uh like a yeah . project manager : yeah . should be possible . yeah you can export it as image . marketing : no . project manager : must yeah must be marketing : should 've done that then . project manager : so the sharing of the information was uh was okay ? user interface : . marketing : pen is here . project manager : uh , network . user interface : uh . project manager : yeah , pen is here on the table . marketing : user interface : uh , yeah . so you can uh project manager : yeah . it 's possible . user interface : it 's possible . marketing : mm . yeah . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . project manager : that 's nice . have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ? or user interface : um , yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev project manager : yeah . user interface : um it 's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . uh , so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh project manager : yeah . so yeah . so everybody puts his own score . user interface : so marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and then it mediates the score , user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : and you can get one user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : that 's better . so that 's uh how do we call ?
