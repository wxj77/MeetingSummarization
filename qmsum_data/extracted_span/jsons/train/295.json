    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about the unintended consequences for this bill ?",
    "answer": "dawn bowden am : so , i 've got largely positive feedback from you in terms of the bill and its intentions , and so on . do you foresee any unintended consequences for this bill ? huw david : if we implement it carefully , if we implement it with the right resources , then i hope not . i think not . but as with every piece of legislation , it is about the implementation , it is about the cultural change as well , and that 's why i can not overstress the importance of making sure that resources are made available , because our social services departments\u2014children 's social services in particular\u2014are overstretched . they are at breaking point\u2014make no bones about it\u2014and they are dealing with children who are facing serious harm and neglect . we are having record numbers of contacts from police , from teachers , from doctors and , of course , from children themselves who are experiencing that harm and neglect . and obviously , we want to focus our energy and our attention on those children . equally , though , we do n't want to lose sight of those families and children that are experiencing significant problems , but who we want to support through our early intervention and prevention programmes , and that is why it is important that there is investment in those programmes , so that children do not end up in that terrible position where we have to , for their safety , take them from their birth families to protect them . and the reality is , in wales , that we are doing that to more children than we 've done for a long time , and the numbers are growing across wales . and that is only because of the most appalling neglect and abuse , because there is no way that any judge would permit us to act to make a child safe if it was not for that fact , and the facts are there . so , i do n't want that focus to be lost , but , of course , we welcome and understand the need to progress this piece of legislation . dawn bowden am : that rise that you talk about here , is that due to more interventions , greater awareness , more incidents ? i 'm trying to link this to the bill in terms of whether the bill is actually going to give you more work to do in those areas . sally jenkins : on the reasons for the rise in the numbers of looked-after children in wales , which are higher than those in england , and also the numbers of contacts that we have across the local authorities , the work of the care crisis review , which was completed last year ; the work of isabelle trowler , who 's the chief social worker in england ; countless research and reports that have taken place in the last 18 months ; and currently the public law working group , under the auspices of the president of the family court , would all indicate that it 's multifactorial . so , what you have is a range of reasons that have led to the increasing numbers of children becoming looked after across england and wales . what you ca n't do is identify a single reason . there have been headlines that have said , 'is it increased austerity ? ' that is clearly a part of this . is it in wales an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of , for example , domestic abuse ? is it because of our understanding of what happens to children in those households ? all of that research would say it 's all of those things . and then , when you also add in changes in our practice with our colleagues in the judiciary , changes in our police service , but also changes in our preventative services , you 've got that whole range of elements . and there is going on across the local authorities and welsh government a huge amount of work to try to address and understand that , and then to ameliorate that . children who need to be in care for safety need to be in care , but what we have to do is get to a point where fewer children come into care and we 're able to protect them , firstly , and secondly where those children who are in care are cared for in a way that delivers the best possible outcomes for them . so , there is no simple answer unfortunately . i think , in terms of this bill and unintended consequences , i agree absolutely with everything that huw has said . my job is around children at that far end , but what this bill does is it brings clarity . it brings a clarity even for those children at that very far end . it takes away even that point of discussion that this could possibly be okay , and i think that 's important to hang on to . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . sorry . alastair birch : one unintended consequences is that i think that there will be an increased focus on the uncrc . and , in terms of children having a discussion around this point , children need to be part of that discussion . it 's something that affects them . and a key aspect of education is the voice of the child . it has become significantly\u2014 . it 's changed completely in the last 10 years , and it is one of the key things in terms of us driving improvements . dawn bowden am : would that be something that you would be looking to do in schools ?"
