    "query": "<s> what were the difficulties faced by the municipal sector ?",
    "answer": "mr. taylor bachrach ( skeenabulkley valley , ndp ) : mr . chair , municipalities across canada are facing a financial crisis . they 've seen revenues plummet , and at the same time the cost of delivering municipal services has risen . as the prime minister knows , municipalities are unable to run deficits and so they are facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that canadians depend on . we know that municipalities are vital during this time to provide services to canadians . they 're going to be even more important during the recovery , especially when it comes to delivering on the infrastructure programs before us . the federation of canadian municipalities and mayors across canada have called for emergency financial relief for the municipal sector . my question for the prime minister is , when can they expect federal financial support to arrive ?"
