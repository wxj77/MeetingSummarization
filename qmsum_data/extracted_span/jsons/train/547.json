    "query": "<s> what was agreed by the team about the component design ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : can you go to the next slide , please . yeah , i have few pictures . when you look at the uh um remote controller uh it 's it 's it this is a normal remote controller . and to the next slide , please . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and where we had a a few buttons and all . and uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and also a capac uh a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm yeah , and di and a diode transistor . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : the electronic components uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d diode transistors an yeah , di um can y uh you can see the t_a_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : mm yes . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors , user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh just beside that you can see a transistor , and a uh uh cylinder shape , uh that one is a capacitor . uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry , ther there is a diode . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : can you go go on to the next slide . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so uh this is the circuit board . the green one is a circuit board . actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it 's a it 's a l l inexpensive . uh it 's it costs less than what you print on a paper , because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires , it 's it 's better to go for printing , because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it 's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you do n't need to use wires and all . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : it 's not exactly wires we are using . it 's just printing something on a board . marketing : industrial designer : tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits . so th that green uh thing is a circuit board , and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , yeah , um integrated circuit . user interface : transmit . industrial designer : can you go to the next slide , please . uh so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . uh can you see the black uh , round marks ? project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : they they are the circuits . next , please . and um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip . marketing : okay . user interface : okay . industrial designer : uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . so that also we can have in a battery , uh or we can use solar sells . uh . marketing : hmm , that 's interesting . industrial designer : yeah . uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases . uh usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller . user interface : okay . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and you have more pictures . uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting . industrial designer : yeah , maybe d uh i have just one more slide , i think . um . like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we ca n't use . um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print , um also infra it includes the infrared se sender . um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker . an yeah , that 's it . it 's all for me now , project manager : okay , well thank you . industrial designer : thank you . project manager : any particular comments by anybody ? marketing : uh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ? industrial designer : no , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before , i think . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all . marketing : industrial designer : so i think it 's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons . marketing : um . we 'll just go for push buttons industrial designer : yeah uh yeah , push-buttons . yeah . user interface : push-buttons . marketing : for in the interest of cost . project manager : okay , before we get too far off here um , the components of the concept is the energy . what kind of energy do we foresee ? battery . marketing : i think i think battery , project manager : battery . user interface : battery . marketing : and i think we all agreed on that . that that 's that 's gon na be most cost-effective and the best thing . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : okay then chip on print . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . and the case . and i think we all agree on the case , we wan na have something uh maybe bright , colourful . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong . user interface : and compact . industrial designer : and also strong . user interface : trendy design and compact . industrial designer : trendy , yeah ."
