    "answer": "the chair : now it 's mr.rayes 's turn . mr.rayes , you have the floor . mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , why is it that employers from industry , businesses and community organizations that have been approved in the canada summer jobs program still have n't received the money they 're entitled to ? hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : we are ensuring that the canada summer jobs program is strengthened and enforced . we are making it more available to more students . we have lengthened the time period that the program the chair : mr.rayes has the floor . mr. alain rayes : every day , the prime minister makes announcements in front of his residence . i 'll repeat my question . given the importance of the program for our youth who are looking to work , how is it that the organizations have n't yet received the money they need to hire students ? as we know , there have been some problems with the cesb . hon . ahmed hussen : our government is working hard to help employers adapt to the realities of covid-19 . we recognize the important role that the canada summer jobs program plays in supporting employers and young workers in communities across the country every year . that is why we have introduced flexibilities in the canada summer jobs program to hire youth while providing more supports to employers . mr. alain rayes : the minister can say whatever he wants . last year , there was no crisis and , as of april , all employers who had been admitted to the program had received the money . we are currently in a crisis . the government is trying to respond quickly to the needs . right now , community organizations are not receiving the money to which they are entitled to hire students , to put them to work and to give them an employment opportunity . why ? hon . ahmed hussen : mr . chair , we have managed to introduce flexibilities to take into consideration the difficult environment of the covid-19 pandemic . as such , the flexibilities we 've introduced into the canada summer jobs program will help with more hiring of youth and more supports to employers , including non-profits and businesses that deliver essential services to canadians . these changes will help small businesses hire and keep the workers that they need in the canada summer jobs program . mr. alain rayes : the young people and employers listening to us must be very surprised by what the minister is saying . he mentioned that the rules are now more flexible . however , it is taking a month and a half longer than last year . the money has not yet been given out . i have done my homework . i went to see what was happening in my riding and in about 10other ridings . last year , in my riding , all the money had been deposited before april . right now , there is a $ 240,000shortfall for about 60student jobs , and the minister has the nerve to tell us that the government has provided more flexibility . why is the money not available if the government wants to act quickly , to help the economy recover and to help young people ? hon . ahmed hussen : mr . chair , indeed we are acting quickly . we are listening to the needs of the employers to make sure that this program works not only for them but also for youth , and that it gives them the experiences they need . it is adapted better for the covid-19 pandemic to ensure that youth have the experience they need to gain life and work skills from the program . it 's a great program , and we 're making it work not just for businesses but also for non-profits . mr. alain rayes : here is the reality . last week , the owner of a hardware store in a village in my riding had to close his business because he was unable to hire students and had no one to work . this morning , an employer called me to tell me that his request to hire a student had been accepted , but that the delay meant that he could not proceed with the hiring . this means that one more young person will not have a job . that young person will therefore have to receive the cesb . there is the reality . when is the government going to release the money required for young people to be able to work ?"
