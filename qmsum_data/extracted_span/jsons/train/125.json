    "answer": "marketing : shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we 've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? project manager : mm-hmm . makes sense . marketing : okay . right um , i have a little thing . so , we 've all got a note of it 's thirteen point seven , is n't it , with everything we want on . project manager : . sorry , do you want that back up ? marketing : yeah , i just had a presentation to do . project manager : right . user interface : but i do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it 's got no battery . project manager : okay , but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . marketing : mm-hmm . mm . right okay um , this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we 've got here . user interface : marketing : and so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we 've formulated . and those ones are gon na be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , i guess . and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it 's neither true nor false , then that 's four . so , i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . um so , we have to say whether it 's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . um the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . whether it 's easy to use . whether it 's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . and whether it 's a sort of recognisable real reaction product . and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , industrial designer : okay . marketing : so i 'll go over here . right . so the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . so if we do a sort of a one so industrial designer : okay , well we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product 's quite good . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so uh marketing : okay . industrial designer : um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . marketing : yeah . yeah . yeah . industrial designer : um , sorry that 'd be considered fancy . user interface : yeah , i 'd maybe give it a a two . marketing : of but i think what is one false , or is t one true ? user interface : one 's true . marketing : i forgot . one 's true , and okay . seven 's fal user interface : and a four is neutral . marketing : four is neutral , okay . so industrial designer : so maybe maybe a two . user interface : yeah , 'cause we have n't got the double curve , so we ca n't like say it 's completely true . project manager : go for one . yep . marketing : right . user interface : but it 's pretty close . we 've got almost everything we can . marketing : okay . right . project manager : okay . marketing : i gon na put underneath so i 've got some more space . so , false is seven , true is one , and so uh say about a two for fancy , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : you think ? project manager : yeah , why not not , marketing : okay . project manager : m m maybe nearer three . marketing : okay , well d you do an average at the end , i do n't know . um project manager : two three . well , it 's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down , we 've got solar power , we 've got uh various other things you could have , and we 're not going for these options . marketing : uh-huh . this this is just this is just for like the look . does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . so project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . marketing : yeah , so that so sh should we go for a a two on that ? project manager : okay . marketing : 'kay . and i mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? industrial designer : um , deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . marketing : d yeah . okay . so , what about the pr the prototype as it is , industrial designer : um marketing : we 've got we 've got the speech recognition on it , have n't we . industrial designer : but not the kinetic . marketing : but not the kinetic . industrial designer : like the power . project manager : no . 'cause you ca n't afford that w we took that out too . industrial designer : no , we c ca yeah , we ca n't afford both . marketing : alright , so project manager : did n't you ? or marketing : so it does n't it 's pretty the prototype as it is is n't sort of um fulfilling the industrial designer : no may is maybe about neutral user interface : maybe a three . industrial designer : plus it it it 's got something , but it has n't got marketing : okay . yeah . project manager : well , wait a minute . in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . user interface : i would give it more than a four . project manager : the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . industrial designer : right . project manager : and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so , it 's very much dependant on what you do with your options . and if you 're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : right , okay . project manager : the other functions we 've got in are are more at the the special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that 's at the high end 'cause that 's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . now you 're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you 're going for the sample sensors speaker , you 're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay . project manager : and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , industrial designer : um project manager : and then you 're looking to uh take out uh point two , marketing : s i 'm just gon na check my email . project manager : which would be come from the button supplements category . marketing : i 'm just gon na check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . user interface : how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? because we did say that we do n't wan na follow the fashion too much . if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . project manager : um , interface type um , user interface : and then it stand the test of time better . project manager : well plastic rather than rubber . marketing : okay . but i project manager : that that that would make the significant difference . you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you 'd be looking to take out point two . so you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : and that would enable you to to do it . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . industrial designer : so it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . , i just read the email again and it sort of says it 's evaluate the design sort of as it is , i think , so i think we need to think about finance after we 've sort of evaluated that design . i do n't know whether we 're doing it in the wrong order or something or . project manager : well , okay , but user interface : well , i suppose it 's rubber as it is , is n't it . project manager : it 's rubber as it is , yes . marketing : so , i mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we 've got both the both the um the speech project manager : we got we 've we 've got thirteen point seven user interface : yeah . project manager : and we 've got it in at the moment and if and basically , we 're going to reduce down from that . marketing : yeah . project manager : but the current one , you 'd say would be fancy , would be too industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : yeah . um , for for innovation , so we 've got the speech the speech thing , and project manager : mm-hmm . i would 've said about a two as well . marketing : do you reckon a two ? user interface : yeah , two or three . i 'd be happy with a two . marketing : okay . two . and the next one is i 'll have to get it back up now . user interface : project manager : the next on well , i can just sing about . easy to use . i would 've said yes . i would go for a one on that at this point in time . user interface : yeah . yeah , marketing : okay . user interface : i would say so as well . project manager : um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . well , yeah it certainly has some . industrial designer : um project manager : . user interface : yeah , it 's got the cherry and the sponginess . industrial designer : it does , yeah . marketing : um say about a three maybe ? project manager : i do n't know . industrial designer : yeah , m um user interface : maybe two ? industrial designer : yeah , it was just doing it quite well . um , i think we 're gon na have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it 's um project manager : yeah , i woulda said two would seem reasonable . marketing : it 's a two . project manager : the product is a recognisable real r uh reaction product ? marketing : yeah , this is industrial designer : uh the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , marketing : this project manager : industrial designer : and it 's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . user interface : yeah , that 's a bit rough at the minute . marketing : yeah . so this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . industrial designer : okay . marketing : so sort of is it sort of a recognisable product . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . project manager : s user interface : marketing : user interface : uh , well it 's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine . marketing : what do y industrial designer : also it 's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um , it depends which way you look at it . marketing : uh-huh . project manager : okay . so we 're going for a two , marketing : so industrial designer : maybe a kind of three ? uh d project manager : three ? user interface : yeah , two or three . marketing : two or three ? user interface : well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . it 's just that the pen would n't really write on that paper . project manager : sure . industrial designer : user interface : but um , i think the logo would definitely be recognisable . marketing : yeah . user interface : and it does have attributes that other products do . two ? aye . go for it . project manager : right , okay . marketing : two or three . user interface : project manager : two . marketing : how project manager : right , come on . that 's that decided . marketing : two . okay . project manager : right . so marketing : right . project manager : so we 're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then marketing : yeah . user interface : what does what do all them numbers mean then ? do we add them up and rate or anything ? marketing : yeah we s yeah , i think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gon na be i 'm just gon na do this in my head . project manager : about a two . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : one point eight is n't it or something . i think , anyway . so yeah , pretty close to a two . industrial designer : yeah , so it 's marketing : so so it 's i mean it 's pretty good at the moment , but it 's gon na get worse , is n't it . but we 've got ta try and make sure it does n't get too bad . project manager : two b two b two , yeah . industrial designer : so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . marketing : industrial designer : okay , so we need to"
