    "answer": "phd f : ok . right . grad d : right . so , i mean , we 'd like to take all these various cues , right ? phd f : like the army . grad d : so this one might be , say , uh grad e : new terminology ? phd f : yeah . grad d : well , let me pick a random one grad e : i have n't heard that before . grad d : and say , uh i do n't know , it could be , like this is n't the way it really is , but let me say that , suppose someone mentioned , uh , admission fees ah , it takes too long . try let me just say `` landmark `` . if the thing is a landmark , you know , um then there 's another thing that says if um if it 's closed or not , at the moment . alright , so you have nodes . right ? and the , uh , problem that we were having was that , you know , given n - nodes , there 's `` two to the n `` given n - nodes , and furthermore , the fact that there 's three things here , we need to specify `` three times `` , uh , `` two to the n `` probabilities . right ? that 's assuming these are all binary , which f they may not be . for example , they could be `` time of day `` , in which case we could , uh , say , you know , `` morning , afternoon , evening , night `` . so , this could be more so , it 's a lot , anyway . and , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain . so noisy - ors are a way to , uh , sort of deal with this . um where should i put this ? so , the idea is that , um , let 's call these , uh , c - one , c - two , c - three , and c - four , and e , for cause and effect , i guess . the idea is to have these intermediate nodes . right . well , actually , the idea , first of all , is that each of these things has a quote - unquote distinguished state , which means that this is the state in which we do n't really know anything about it . so right ? so , for example , if we do n't really know if the thing is a landmark or not , or , i if that just does n't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the disting - the distinguish state . it 's a really , you know , if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee , you know , if they did n't talk about it , that would be the distinguish state . grad c : s so , this is a fanciful way of saying `` default `` ? grad d : so yeah , yeah . that 's just what they the word they used in that paper . grad c : mm - hmm ."
