    "query": "<s> summarize their discussions on amendment 11 and 12 that relate to the duty to ensure sufficient funding .",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 3 be agreed . does any member object ? amendment 3 is therefore agreed . the committee will now break for 10 minutes and reconvene at 11.05 a.m. can i welcome members back ? we will move on to group 4 , which relates to the duty to ensure sufficient funding . the lead amendment in the group is amendment 11 in the name of janet finch-saunders . i call on janet finch-saunders to move amendment 11 and to speak to her amendments . janet . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . i speak to both amendments in this group . as i outlined under amendments 2i and 2j , there are ongoing concerns about the potential costs for welsh devolved authorities and the lack of quantifiable costs within the regulatory impact assessment . now , it was absolutely clear from evidence that we received in this committee that unknown costs would be challenging and potentially problematic . as i have mentioned previously , these concerns would doubtless be most keenly felt in our hard-pressed social services . furthermore , the welsh local government association stated that there must be a commitment that whatever the costs are , those costs are met , because it is legislation that is being led by the national assembly for wales . now , during evidence , the deputy minister , when asked about the reliance on a limited number of reporting of cases likely to happen and the potential for a degree of unknown costs stated : 'we are doing our very best to prepare to cover all eventualities that we can anticipate . ' but you could n't commit to a broad figure , instead telling us that : 'we have to rely on what the people who run those organisations are telling us . ' and : 'we have to measure it as we go along . ' given that devolved authorities need to plan their budgets for these changes , we only think it is fair for the welsh government to provide sufficient funding to alleviate the cost implications of this bill . now , while amendment 11 makes reference to costs borne by local authorities and health boards , i note that amendment 12 takes this further by including other devolved authorities that are not funded by welsh government . anticipating the deputy minister 's response that few under this category , if any at all , would be affected by the bill , we are pursuing a principle here , and it is agreement to the principle of providing sufficient funding that we are seeking from you as the deputy minister . now , these are just two examples of welsh government legislation to date that have been underfunded . the active travel ( wales ) act 2013 : last year , the economy , infrastructure and skills committee found that the wales annual spend on walking and cycling is half that of england 's and one sixth of holland 's . furthermore , the committee highlighted that the passing of the act put a requirement on local authorities to continuously improve active travel routes , but were constrained by the funding made available to them . the minister at the time announced a three-year funding settlement of \u00a360 million . now , my local authority and other authorities that have done some monitoring on the active travel act\u2014they simply were not awarded sufficient funding to actually allow the active travel act to become a meaningful piece of legislation , and the same goes with the well-being of future generations ( wales ) act 2015 . this month , the auditor general has raised concerns that the public services boards created under the act were limited in their work and impact due to the lack of dedicated funding . outside of the welsh government 's regional grant that can not be spent on projects , councils often contribute through officer time or facilities , but resources and capacity to support those psbs remain a key risk , as partners do n't have the capacity to take on more . the reason that i wanted these amendments placed in here is i genuinely do not believe that you 've even envisioned what , or even estimated the likely cost to be borne by the organisations , and certainly our local authorities and health boards , the impact this bill is going to have . lynne neagle am : thank you , janet . are there other members who would like to speak in this group , please ? no . okay . i call the deputy minister , then . julie morgan am : thank you , chair . i can understand that the member is concerned about the impact of this bill on public services , but you will see from the explanatory memorandum and from the raft of impact statements published with the bill that we 've done a thorough and extremely diligent job of considering the potential impacts of this bill before introduction . and as far as we 're aware , no other country has done more than us to consider the impacts of similar legislation , and also comprehensively prepared for implementation . we 've explored the published data , which is available from other countries , on the impact of measures they 've taken to prohibit the physical punishment of children . we 've also spoken to a range of stakeholders in ireland , new zealand and malta , who have legal systems similar to our own . and in these countries , there is no evidence that public services have been overwhelmed following law reform . and stakeholders have been clear when giving evidence to this committee that they do not consider there will be runaway costs , and i think we should trust their judgment on this . in fact , as this committee notes in its stage 1 report , those delivering services on the front line have said , without exception , that 'this bill will improve their ability to protect children living in wales because it will make the law clear . ' sally jenkins of the association of directors of social services said to this committee : 'in terms of thresholds for children \u2019 s services , we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us . there may be a small number of referrals that come through . what we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle . we recognise that \u2019 s likely to happen . ' that 's from the front line . jane randall , chair of the national independent safeguarding board wales , said : 'there 's no expectation that there 's going to be a huge increase in the number of referrals coming through to local authority social services , i think it would be dealt with within their existing resources . ' and dr rowena christmas , royal college of general practitioners , said : ' i ca n't see it 's going to lengthen consultations . i ca n't see that it 's going to increase the number of consultations , and i do n't think it 's going to increase the number of referrals i make to the health visitor or to social services , because if i was worried , i 'd make those referrals now regardless of the bill . ' i just want to say again that the bill is removing a defence to an offence of common assault , which has formed part of the common law of england and wales for a very long time . and social services already receive and investigate reports of children being assaulted , including from health and education , so it 's not a whole new area of costly activity for any of them . i do think that the evidence that you had at your committee did highlight those points . as i 've already pointed out when discussing group 2 amendments , we 're working with organisations to put in place arrangements to collect data about the possible impact on their services , and this will be analysed as part of the post-implementation review of the legislation . welsh government can consider with relevant organisations how best to manage any impact on workloads or resources and any cost implications . i can assure you that work to update the regulatory impact assessment has continued , and i 've asked officials to prepare a revised ria , as recommended at stage 2 , and i expect to share an updated ria with you in advance of stage 3 . serious consideration is being given on how to provide more detailed estimates of the unknown costs to public services arising from the bill , but i think you should be reassured by the evidence that was given , particularly to this committee , from the professionals at the front line . what the amendments are proposing is outside the normal funding arrangements that operate within government , and it 's not clear why , in the context of the evidence heard at stage i , such provisions are necessary . i 'm sure that members will agree that future governments need to be able to consider , within the context of the budget-setting process , what the priorities are , and these considerations would need to be made within the context at that time , for example taking into account any issues that there are\u2014uk government actions , what happens in relation to brexit , or any other unforeseen impacts on the economy or welsh society . all those issues would have to be taken into account . furthermore , as is the case now , the national assembly for wales scrutinises the welsh government budget annually , so it would be able to make an argument for additional funding for public bodies , should it consider that this is required . i do think all the evidence has shown that we do not anticipate that there will be a huge increase of a demand for funding , so i urge members to reject these amendments , which i believe are unnecessary . janet finch-saunders am : chair , could i ask a question ? lynne neagle am : you can reply to the debate now , janet , yes . janet finch-saunders am : i 'd like to ask a question of the deputy minister . when we were taking evidence , at an earlier stage , i noticed that part of the stakeholder group\u2014there was some liaison going on with social services departments across wales . now , we have 22 local authorities . at that time , the numbers mentioned were quite small\u2014i think only a handful . what discussions have taken place with our local authorities in terms of their social services departments in terms of the lead , the cabinet members , or , indeed , the head of service ? i can speak from my own experiences , when going around my constituency , but when i 've spoken to some of the family support groups , and , indeed , the departments themselves , they are very concerned about the financial impact that this is going to have on the provision . they 're already overstretched , and they see this as another burden\u2014primarily another financial burden . so , how much have you engaged with them ? julie morgan am : there 's been extensive engagement . we 've had meetings with the association of directors of social services , and they 're represented on all our groups , and we 're working very closely with them , because , of course , they represent all the local authorities . but i have to say , when i 've been going round and meeting lots of different groups , the first thing they say is , ' i 'm so glad that you 're doing this ' , and they have n't mentioned any financial implications . but , obviously , we will be very aware of\u2014we are looking at any more evidence that comes up . janet finch-saunders am : okay . so , i 'll still move my amendments . i 'm disappointed , really . i was hoping to see some commitment to\u2014this bill was going to go through , and it 's one that could be implemented fully , because sufficient resources were there . i 'm not convinced about that , and i know that other organisations are not also . so , i move my amendments . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 11 be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] i therefore take a vote by show of hands . all those in favour . all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against . amendment 11 is not agreed . janet , do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 12 ? janet finch-saunders am : i move ."
