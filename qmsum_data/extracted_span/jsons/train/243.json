    "answer": "project manager : okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting . again , i 'm gon na take minutes . oh , we 're gon na have a prototype presentation first . uh , who 's gon na give the prototype presentation ? you two guys ? okay . go ahead . industrial designer : yes . user interface : . marketing : . user interface : coffee . marketing : industrial designer : 'kay , we 've made a prototype . um , we 've got uh uh our aspects from the last meeting . uh , especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . um , we 've uh drawn here the p prototype . the logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control , user interface : industrial designer : but it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher . um , our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . maybe you can uh point them uh the functions . user interface : uh , well the uh all the functions are discussed uh i think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . uh , it 's a little bit . uh , power button . uh then the the the nine uh channels . project manager : user interface : uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . and then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext project manager : oh no , the the the mute button misses now . user interface : i thought that was th marketing : alright , i project manager : do y do you user interface : oh , the mute button . project manager : did we want to have a m mute button ? industrial designer : but uh that marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it 's uh here then , in the middle . user interface : yeah . marketing : alright , and uh you got ta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . industrial designer : yes , um user interface : well , yeah mo uh mo industrial designer : we 've disc user interface : yeah , well most of them are right-handed . industrial designer : most of the users marketing : yeah , but you you got ta make it clear on the on user interface : yeah well , i do n't have time in uh anymore on the industrial designer : yes , y there there will be a p a little a little p_ on that and a little uh yeah . marketing : yeah , and a and a triangle on that . user interface : oh yeah , just progr programme above , i think . marketing : yes . next to that i kinda miss a zero actually . user interface : project manager : wait , there 's was one thing i wanted to ask . marketing : industrial designer : user interface : marketing : industrial designer : project manager : uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like marketing : project manager : uh d i call it teens and twenties . uh , y th th th the two numbers . marketing : all n no , that 's um kinda dependent on the television . user interface : yeah , true , yeah . industrial designer : it 's a television . yes . project manager : yeah , but do we have do we need extra buttons , user interface : uh project manager : for example some uh some have to user interface : uh i think so . marketing : i think industrial designer : yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh marketing : yeah , i think you should add user interface : zero ? marketing : a cross , or whatever . yeah , line . project manager : yeah , but you do n't you do n't actually need them , user interface : may maybe here ? project manager : becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds user interface : yeah . and then a second . marketing : no , that 's dependent on the television . project manager : no , i do n't think so . industrial designer : yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press marketing : i do know so . user interface : is it depending on television ? project manager : nah , i do n't think so really , marketing : yeah . project manager : because you have a i know some remote controls that do n't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . industrial designer : yes , but but a lot uh marketing : yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television . or actually , the other way around . project manager : no , i think uh i really think it 's n marketing : but project manager : because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it 's the same thing as when you just push the one , marketing : yeah . project manager : because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . industrial designer : yes , but marketing : yeah , well but su if industrial designer : some televisions do n't accept uh that that project manager : yeah , because that 's i it 's for television . it 's exact the same thing . industrial designer : no , no , but s marketing : no no no . so some television respond differently . look , if uh i i project manager : no , listen listen . when you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . i in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . marketing : yes . yes , that 's true . project manager : the one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you do n't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . user interface : yeah . true . marketing : no project manager : i think it works that way , really . marketing : no , it it it works uh if you have n't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . project manager : yeah , but it 's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button . industrial designer : yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . project manager : yeah , but you do n't underst uh you do n't understand my point . marketing : yep . true . project manager : i think it 's exact the same thing when y industrial designer : you want yes , but some television do n't support it . project manager : no , but then they would a would also support that button , because it 's the same thing . user interface : but the ex project manager : listen , with that that 's that special but button you 're talking about , eh ? that 's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv tv that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . when you do n't have that separate button , and you push y one , it 's exactly the same thing . do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had marketing : no , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c industrial designer : a remote can project manager : yeah . but you give the input . industrial designer : so they need no , they need project manager : you push the one . that 's the same thing as the button with the one and it marketing : no , that 's not true . project manager : yes it it is . marketing : it 's simply not true . it 's simply not true . project manager : think about it . user interface : yeah . you uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something industrial designer : but uh marketing : uh project manager : and it 's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . marketing : no , remote control does n't give signal after five seconds . remote control is a stupid thing . if you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television . project manager : yeah , that 's true . yeah , but i m uh but it 's i i know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that does n't sport these buttons , it still works . industrial designer : yeah , it project manager : but okay , we we 'll impl marketing : no , definitely not . definitely not . user interface : we 'll discuss them in the usability lab . project manager : no , we 'll apply them then for now . user interface : uh eva evaluation . marketing : user interface : i do n't know uh i do n't know if if it 's it 's necessary . project manager : yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . user interface : yeah ? project manager : yeah , i think so . yeah , for now , if we do n't know for sure whether user interface : okay . industrial designer : and the button for the scart uh audio video uh external input . project manager : yeah but marketing : uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , i guess . project manager : okay . what i said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : but i still think i it it all tvs in some ways support it , i do n't know . i think it 's more c is m maybe we do n't uh we both do n't really understand how it i how it really works , industrial designer : no , no . project manager : but i think there 's more to in than wha than what you just said . industrial designer : uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . project manager : i do think that uh m tvs support mur multiple kind of remote controls . m industrial designer : uh , some n some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten project manager : th wo n't work wi with uh industrial designer : no , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . project manager : to have that special button . industrial designer : when you uh press one button , you give one signal . and the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . but project manager : okay , well we 'll see . industrial designer : when you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . marketing : okay . i kinda miss the docking station . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yes . it 's here on the user interface : marketing : user interface : well it industrial designer : user interface : yeah , uh there 's nothing i think it 's pretty basic , industrial designer : we came uh user interface : the the there 's no fu there 's one there 's one button , marketing : no nothing really trendy about it . user interface : that 's wha there 's there 's there 's one function and that 's n the one button when you want to find it . industrial designer : but maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , marketing : the button . industrial designer : because real real reaction sells more products than only remote controls . so maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh m_p_ three players or or uh uh hearing devices . marketing : i think that 's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . industrial designer : yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it 's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh marketing : yeah , of course . mm-hmm . well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course . industrial designer : yes , but we can make marketing : the technology and the voltage can be the same . that 's uh that 's true . but uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . industrial designer : no , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . marketing : yeah , that 's true , but uh industrial designer : when when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . just have to be big enough for the biggest marketing : yes , but uh i i g should n't it fall then ? it is n't going to fall down ? that 's a bit uh industrial designer : no , when you make it large enough no it it will not . marketing : yeah , i think industrial designer : but then it 's a little bit marketing : no , but if if like this , i 'll i 'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , industrial designer : but it 's just an idea . marketing : i wo n't draw it really . if you got a base which is uh as big as this industrial designer : but it 's flat it 's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this . user interface : you can . but i i i it 's backwards . marketing : yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can industrial designer : yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big user interface : but it 's it 's backwards . it 's leaning . it 's leaning backwards , i think , in the in the docking station . marketing : yeah . uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom user interface : that 's text . marketing : oh , right , help . project manager : but user interface : marketing : uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the industrial designer : yes , little holer littler uh , little products go deeper in it . marketing : yeah . that i that is possible , yep . project manager : well let 's ha let 's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . marketing : yeah , sure , you 're right . industrial designer : yes . and uh uh project manager : but we have to look n i do n't know . industrial designer : the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . marketing : i do n't like the colours . mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so it 's it 's it 's really good design . marketing : yeah . alright . project manager : yes . that 's it ? industrial designer : yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . marketing : the light . okay . and other lights ? project manager : i think added lights are gon na be a problem too . industrial designer : yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . marketing : no , o on the on the front . yeah , okay . maybe the uh the logo . user interface : lights ? industrial designer : but , it will also uh uh use batteries , marketing : yeah , why not ? industrial designer : and do we want to marketing : of course . project manager : okay . for now , uh this is uh is good enough . yeah , what was uh on the marketing : okay . industrial designer : the all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh project manager : okay , but in the oh yeah , the colour , because we 're gon na use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , is n't it ? then we 're gon na do the buttons in the i are we 're gon na have rubber buttons . and they 're be a they 'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . user interface : yeah . marketing : uh , in the same colour as the side . user interface : yeah . yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah , i think i think that 'll be good . project manager : okay . and i think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff industrial designer : yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , so it will uh project manager : yeah , we 'll talk about the lights later . 'cause i also don yeah , it 's depends on the costs and such . but uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , marketing : yeah . project manager : but may i dunno if that 's important , but we 'll talk about that later . okay , for now this is this is okay . marketing : we will . project manager : um , the next p y you gon na give a presentation too ? uh , i have to see the agenda . marketing : well , uh yeah , i i 'm gon na do something right there , yeah . user interface : project manager : detail design . marketing : we got ta do that on the right the most right-most screen , because the leftmost project manager : evaluation criteria . marketing : yep , that 's me . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : alright . i will be needing that image , so leave it please . um go away . right , we 're gon na evaluate that design according to a few points . um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . project manager : marketing : i wan na have a colour over here , come on . right , the remote is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but the positive things has to be on the left , so i said not ugly instead of ugly . user interface : marketing : uh , what would you say , we we got ta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . user interface : project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : the remote control is not ugly . how do you feel ? project manager : yeah , i think four maybe would be appropriate , because it 's yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . uh , i mean it 's kind of , our design . it 's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : background colour . project manager : i do n't know or uh i do n't know how you casting . yeah . industrial designer : i think i think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own marketing : how do you guys feel ? the different designs . industrial designer : yes , you can make it in your own uh user interface : yeah . industrial designer : more to your own personality or or house style . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah , but we d we did n't we 're we 're not planning to use fronts , i believe . marketing : no , not not fronts , but different designs . project manager : with a colour a co a colours . oh , okay . user interface : no , not fronts . different designs . different colours maybe , yeah . marketing : and that 's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , i guess . project manager : okay , but oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our marketing : what ? yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? personally . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or forty . user interface : we can make it a one . marketing : personally . yes , but what is it ? industrial designer : i think two or three . user interface : mm yeah . marketing : guido ? user interface : i agree . marketing : two or three . user interface : um , i uh i go for the positive . so i go for two . marketing : i was i was thinking about three , so i guess project manager : uh , i was thinking about four , so i think three is uh user interface : okay , three . marketing : three is uh a bit uh oh , what am i doing ? i 'll mark it . the remote control 's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah well , let that let 's make that a one . user interface : two . one . one . marketing : yeah ? antek , you agree ? user interface : okay yeah , i 'll i 'll agree . project manager : that 's one thing for sure . marketing : yeah . you 're not antek . user interface : i 'm the i 'm the usability , so marketing : i totally agree . the remote control the remote control 's relevant buttons are prominently visible . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , two or a one , i guess . user interface : the project manager : it 's something we really put work into . marketing : yeah , i yeah . industrial designer : it 's all about the buttons . marketing : i would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . and our oh yeah , it 's a b yeah . yeah ? alright . that 's a one ? you agree ? project manager : yeah . marketing : the remote control has n't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . i think we totally succeeded there . project manager : but user interface : well project manager : well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . marketing : oh user interface : yeah , well menu yeah , maybe . marketing : yeah , that 's true . that 's true . project manager : and telete industrial designer : also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , project manager : yeah , we do n't know if the uh they 're necessary . industrial designer : o they 're used uh uh marketing : the the yeah , m well , you d you 've got a point . project manager : i think a two . user interface : yeah , true . yeah , i agree . industrial designer : can yes , three , two . project manager : came a long way , but not we did n't not uh marketing : two or three ? user interface : mm two . industrial designer : but you ca n't make a remote control without them , marketing : two ? antek . user interface : because we got industrial designer : because marketing : nay that that that 's true , that 's true . they 're definitely needed . project manager : no , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is marketing : so we put it on a two ? project manager : yeah . marketing : the remote control has got a really trendy look . user interface : industrial designer : yes . a one . project manager : yeah , uh a t i think a two . marketing : maarten . user interface : well . industrial designer : project manager : yeah yeah , y i it 's hard to say from this picture . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we we 've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . user interface : yeah . marketing : ever , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : guido . project manager : but i do think it 's more user interface : uh , i will i will make it a three , because uh yeah . i i th project manager : but i do think that it 's more trendy than beautiful . marketing : yeah , uh i agree . i agree . project manager : so so i think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the user interface : yeah . true , yeah . marketing : i was planning to give it a two , uh where i give the not ugly uh project manager : a th a three . marketing : oh , yeah , that 's true . you agree on the two ? user interface : yeah . project manager : i i uh when you compare to the marketing : great . remote control has n't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . project manager : uh uh what 's the difference with user interface : marketing : uh , i copied that one . well , uh forget that . project manager : okay . marketing : um go away . remote control has got innovative technology implanted . user interface : no . we 're not well , maybe the the the on the side . industrial designer : no , not lcd , so . project manager : yeah , but we uh you mean the rubber stuff ? marketing : yeah , and the light . project manager : yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . user interface : and the light maybe . industrial designer : but that that 's not innovative . user interface : but project manager : and i do n't u also it 's also really not innovative , industrial designer : lights lights are marketing : well , i g project manager : it 's more marketing : it 's not seven ? project manager : no , six . or seven maybe , yeah . user interface : well , six . no , six . project manager : or six . marketing : why uh why not a seven ? project manager : yeah , mine is seven . industrial designer : because we 've tried to make it a little bit innovative , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but it but it project manager : uh it 's uh depends on the on the maybe industrial designer : with the lights it it 's it 's kind of future user interface : project manager : no , i think i think actually it 's a seven maybe , but there 's nothing innovative about it . marketing : yeah , you think the lights are innovative ? well , it 's n true . uh , i agree , industrial designer : but still you can retrieve it when it 's when it 's gone , with the with marketing : m but user interface : innovative in generally or just f original for marketing : i 'll yeah , you you did n't draw the docking station . industrial designer : yes . the docking station is a is a little bit innovative . project manager : n no no , marketing : yeah , it it 's i think i think with its project manager : t . user interface : a docking station is innova project manager : yeah , i mean the dock station , but but uh , i think the the docking station , it 's gon na be a kind of a problem . user interface : industrial designer : it 's a part of the remote . marketing : i think more m user interface : okay . industrial designer : and with the speaker on the there 's also a speaker . project manager : but marketing : uh that that 's n project manager : well , let 's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . well i i yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : no uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so i think we project manager : okay , for now it 's a six or a seven uh , sev marketing : it 's it 's a six . project manager : six maybe , because industrial designer : but the retrieval or the marketing : that m f project manager : yeah , but i do n't i do n't know if it 's very inno yeah . marketing : yeah , for the retrieval function . yeah . i think that 's very innovative for a remote control . project manager : yeah , v industrial designer : yes , how would you innovate a remote control more ? project manager : yeah , more through uh like function tv functionalities and industrial designer : to put it on your head . project manager : no no , you know what i mean . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : you have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your marketing : yeah sure , but project manager : yeah . yeah , it 's marketing : but i d i definitely do n't think it 's a five , project manager : that 's that 's think about it la later on marketing : but project manager : and uh marketing : remote control is easy to use . project manager : yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . industrial designer : yes . user interface : yeah , a two . marketing : i think a two . project manager : yeah , it 's good . marketing : yeah ? user interface : more two . marketing : come on . the remote control has n't got uh . project manager : no , i would have seen that one before . oh , you skipped one uh industrial designer : marketing : i 've just filled uh project manager : uh , here . marketing : go away . industrial designer : you like the buttons . marketing : i found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . project manager : remote control will be bought by marketing : it will be bought by people under the age of forty . project manager : yeah . definitely . well industrial designer : in in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ? marketing : no no no . no , just if they if they buy it . project manager : uh , just in general . yeah , a two . industrial designer : we do n't know . but project manager : yeah , but i think i think two . marketing : yeah , what do you think ? user interface : yeah , i think two , yeah . i agree . two . marketing : antek ? industrial designer : yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly . project manager : uh , that is not the question . it 's just w it will be bought by people under forty . marketing : no , that 's no comparison . project manager : yeah , you can yeah , you can be very picky about it . marketing : and i do n't mean two people . industrial designer : this is just guessing . project manager : ah yeah , just make it we 'll make it a two . industrial designer : make it a two . when it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu marketing : right , the rem the remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . project manager : oh no . yeah . yeah , you have make an user interface : we do n't have the slogan though . project manager : slogan is quite obvious . marketing : oh , the slogan . project manager : oh the oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . marketing : can we see the slogan ? project manager : yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to . user interface : the logo . industrial designer : a logo . user interface : underneath it or something . industrial designer : yes , uh encrypted uh with project manager : yeah , and i will i th still think it 's gon na be a two or a three . marketing : are we gon na do that ? user interface : a three . three . project manager : maybe a three this time . user interface : yeah , a three . marketing : three ? i agree . because of the slogan project manager : and uh marketing : remote control 's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . project manager : uh , it 's a one or a two . user interface : yeah , two . project manager : yeah , make it a two . marketing : two ? two . alright . we got ta add up the scores now to see our total average . four , five , seven , nine . forget that . fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . twenty six . it 's a two point six . project manager : it 's not that bad . marketing : alright , we project manager : yeah , and that 's mostly the inno marketing : yeah . project manager : when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , marketing : yeah . true . project manager : which is uh quite a great score . okay . uh , this is was uh the evaluation ? marketing : this was my evaluation . so project manager : because i i still think that the most important part of this meeting still has marketing : we did a pretty nice job until now . project manager : yeah . marketing : um , is this your industrial designer : is there something after this uh meeting ? or marketing : whatever . well , i think we got ta fill out another questionnaire . user interface : no . okay , yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : project manager : still opened or uh yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , finance . because um user interface : shoot . project manager : i received uh a spreadsheet . marketing : a five . a five . project manager : yeah , but i uh actually do n't need this presentation , i guess . oh . marketing : does n't matter . project manager : i 'm gon na open the spreadsheet and we 're gon na work this out together , because i did n't really fin uh i have a . did n't really finish it . well , we uh we 'll see . we 'll stumble upon some problems . marketing : we probably will . project manager : i probably have already opened it here . try it again . first of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . but let 's let 's st start with beginning . we include one battery . i i uh i 'll explain its uh , the the components are listed over here . uh , price is given . we um yeah , marketing : the amount , yeah . project manager : we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . and then uh , we 'll uh calcula do n't watch the number yet . i do n't know if it 's filled in properly . okay , we need one battery . one battery . i think one battery is enough . we do n't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . a s okay , this this is a p first problem . uh , i think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips industrial designer : uh it 's it 's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . project manager : okay . but industrial designer : the simple chip is e enough i i think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh marketing : i do n't know project manager : where did we find this information ? was it marketing : i have n't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . project manager : i think it was uh your job in the first uh meet uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . industrial designer : no , uh i yes , my my my uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : the the email i got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like i think the advanced chip maybe . marketing : yeah . and how do you know ? i mean , you got that email . did it point out what to use them for ? industrial designer : bec no , the they did n't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . project manager : maybe you can uh look it up right now . okay , but okay . when we do n't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what industrial designer : then it 's a simple chip . project manager : then it would be a simple chip . and with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . industrial designer : yes , i i i s i marketing : alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , i guess . project manager : okay . industrial designer : that will be enough for future uh recommendations . project manager : yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . the sample sensor sample speaker . what is it m is that the speaker we were t i do n't know what it is . industrial designer : i do n't know it uh either . marketing : i do n't know . project manager : okay , we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber . and with a special colour . i guess that 's what we were user interface : well , special colour . . project manager : yeah , i do n't know about the special colour , but i think w uh industrial designer : otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . user interface : i do n't marketing : i do n't know if it 's very special . project manager : yeah , i think we uh we have special colours . user interface : mm okay . industrial designer : standard rubber . marketing : alright , that 's okay . project manager : okay , then the push-button , i was just counting them . industrial designer : st project manager : uh , i think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , is n't it ? user interface : whoa , it 's a little project manager : well that 's bit of a problem , because i re but i really do n't understand that , because i can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it would n't be possible according to this uh sheet . user interface : that 's huge . no . we have the simplest buttons . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : no , it 's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . marketing : i do n't think so , because it says amount . industrial designer : if you use a scroll-wheel project manager : ah . yeah , it would n't marketing : the the the yellow row is the amount of project manager : fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost i do n't know . i industrial designer : maybe it 's the kind of push-buttons . you can have f four kind of push-buttons . user interface : uh , one til nine . industrial designer : rubber . user interface : is that one or is that nine buttons ? industrial designer : you can have uh project manager : and i count them like this . one two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . user interface : yeah . project manager : because oh , this is oh , this is one , okay . twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , i uh rated them as uh um as uh uh uh separate buttons . industrial designer : different , marketing : that 's total of four buttons . project manager : and plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it 's will be uh eighteen . marketing : i think that eighteen . one two three four five , si industrial designer : why is that so uh expensive . project manager : yeah , i do n't understand . y i do i do n't get the point , because it 's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . user interface : is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ? marketing : fifty cents for one single stupid button . user interface : no way . industrial designer : so , whe when you so then it project manager : well , okay , well well let 's make it just one . industrial designer : it 's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of project manager : here , now it 's now it 's already s marketing : yeah , exactly . yeah . project manager : shall we just give our own interpretation to , user interface : project manager : because else we would really have a problem . it would be impossible to make it marketing : i ca n't user interface : it 's way marketing : i i i could n't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . really . industrial designer : when you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . board . project manager : and and less buttons than this is n't possible . industrial designer : and then throw it marketing : yeah , yeah , industrial designer : project manager : this is the most simple user interface : no , no no . project manager : yeah , it is possible , but i 've never seen one before . industrial designer : but whe project manager : industrial designer : i 've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , project manager : marketing : no , really . project manager : yeah , without the numbers . that 's possible . yeah , we could skip the numbers . user interface : yeah , uh industrial designer : but but marketing : yeah , but i d i would n't want to own that . really . user interface : that 's still four . industrial designer : uh , it 's it 's still for little children . they can handle that remote control , marketing : yeah . project manager : then uh , teletext would also be im impossible . industrial designer : but but it is n't fo yes , it 's for it 's li uh it 's just for a little user interface : yeah , that 's no option , that 's no option . project manager : okay , we 'll we 'll just okay . but then still , when we there 's no room for a docking station or something . tha w le let 's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . we 'll give the buttons special colour . we 'll give them a special form . uh , i think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , i guess . user interface : a special colour , why a special colour ? project manager : because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . user interface : but wha what s what special ? project manager : i think that 's the what they mean by a special colour . user interface : okay , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise , it user interface : uh , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise it would be the marketing : i do n't think the special form is really true . project manager : i think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that 's what we were planning to do , making it industrial designer : special form also , it says . project manager : yeah , special material r also , marketing : is it ? project manager : because i has rubber . and the buttons have to be rubber . industrial designer : what is the normal material ? user interface : plastic . marketing : yeah , i dunno . industrial designer : sh yeah . user interface : plastic , i think . industrial designer : classic ? user interface : plastic . industrial designer : oh , plastic . marketing : plastic . project manager : 'kay , but the problem now is that the there 's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station project manager : separately . user interface : se no no no . industrial designer : yes . and and but we do n't have to tell it , but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . project manager : yeah , yeah . yeah , but i do like the idea , but we yeah . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : it uh but it then the docking station is n't relevant for this project anymore , but we can industrial designer : no , but you otherwise you ca n't retrieve it . project manager : but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need . marketing : yeah , i really do n't get it . i mean if it 's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents . project manager : i think we can agree on this . i i think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . 'cause i think we uh marketing : yeah , yep . project manager : yeah , i think that 's what what what they uh mean industrial designer : but for two euros and thirty cents , we uh we do n't get a docking station . marketing : i think so , too . oh , i do n't know . project manager : but can we find out uh about uh this chips ? because when we do n't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip . user interface : and then we can get a docking station . project manager : and maybe then we can do something extra . oh , n uh oh , still industrial designer : for project manager : oh , it 's gon na get more expensive with . two . user interface : project manager : then we have some money left . we can put then industrial designer : for two euros . project manager : we can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : uh why ? project manager : yeah , well who knows . or a little bit of tin titanium . marketing : i mean i i if you if it would cost two euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , i mean uh we 're not gon na add uh a trip to hawaii to it . user interface : but what what can we do project manager : yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . that 's also maybe an idea . user interface : but uh what can we do with the simple chip and what 's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? project manager : yeah that 's what then what he has to find out . maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . user interface : if if i project manager : maybe is that that 's nice to know . user interface : regular chip and because we do n't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example . project manager : yeah , bu bu but when we yeah , but when we skip when we um when we do n't use the do we 're not gon na make the docking station , then we still yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , marketing : i like the hand dynamo part . project manager : because that was our our special feature . marketing : we can make a plain docking station for two euros . user interface : yeah . we 'll go back uh tomorrow . marketing : i mean project manager : yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe marketing : wi wi without recharge project manager : it still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . marketing : yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two euros uh if you do n't put the recharge function in it . i mean , it has a shape . project manager : yeah , but for two euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , marketing : of course it has a shape , but i i project manager : then two euros is n't even possible . marketing : why should that not be possible ? project manager : yeah , then because then we 'd thirty cents left . marketing : no , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . project manager : yeah , but yeah , i do n't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip . user interface : that 's the question . if we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f project manager : yeah , and w and and we uh need f industrial designer : it is n't in my information , so i do n't know it uh either . project manager : and what is this ? sample sensor sample speaker . industrial designer : it is n't in my information , i uh i i 've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or project manager : you can look at it for s presentation . s technical functions ? industrial designer : uh i 've got here in uh user interface : no no , they were uh mine , yeah . industrial designer : i will put a i will put a page on it . when my mouse works again . project manager : oh , oh oh . hey . oh . industrial designer : my mouse is uh marketing : dead . reanimate it . user interface : died . industrial designer : oh . ah , i 've got it . i will put uh my email on the the network . marketing : what the hell are these ? industrial designer : it 's on it . marketing : oh , whatever . user interface : yeah , it 's open . marketing : project manager : mm . i do n't think here it 's in here already . user interface : it 's circuit board . it 's only just basics for for project manager : it 's nothing about s yeah . user interface : at the end circuit there is an infrared led . marketing : this is n't helpful . project manager : no . but i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . which one was it ? user interface : components design . project manager : functional requirements ? industrial designer : um marketing : no , that was my presentation . user interface : components design maybe . n on top . industrial designer : yes , that was mine . project manager : ah . ah yes , it was the second one . industrial designer : but that was my second project manager : yeah , it was your second marketing : it 's already open . project manager : your first presentation . marketing : it 's at the bottom . project manager : sorry ? user interface : working design . marketing : it 's uh at your task bar . user interface : yeah , but it 's the the other one . industrial designer : mm project manager : uh , this is n this is not this n user interface : was it working design or components design ? marketing : sorry . project manager : that 's not the right one . i do n't oh . marketing : okay , sorry . project manager : no , this is the other one . or maybe something is uh maybe there 's something abo in in these user interface : chip set . industrial designer : but this is the same uh this is o only the possibilities . project manager : here . industrial designer : yeah . we can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . marketing : yeah , nice . i it does n't say anything . user interface : the display requires an advanced chip . project manager : you know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires industrial designer : ah , okay . project manager : okay , so we only need a simple chip . user interface : requires . industrial designer : with the light . user interface : little lights . yeah , but that that 's just the same as the the led . project manager : no no , that 's just a simple chip . a scroll-wheel marketing : that 's not needed . project manager : it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . so , we do n't need any of them . marketing : a display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . for showing text . industrial designer : lcd . user interface : yeah . marketing : i do n't think that uh just a l a little light user interface : no . i think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . marketing : yeah , i agree . project manager : and what 's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? industrial designer : maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , i guess so too . user interface : yeah , true . well , that 's not too what we want . marketing : next channel . no . well , we might want it , but user interface : project manager : okay . industrial designer : all in twelve euros . project manager : back to the costs . industrial designer : twelve euros and fifty cents . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we 're gon na use the simple chip . user interface : so , simple chip is okay . marketing : great . delete . industrial designer : and the lights . where uh are the lights ? marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , lights , yeah , there 's no marketing : well , there 're three , i guess . user interface : category . project manager : nah , there is some money left to be spent . user interface : can we do it wi within two two euro ? marketing : i think we can make a docking station . yeah . project manager : okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? but i mean it is n't it has n't got any innovative technology , we are n't gon na apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway , i think . i do n't i do n't see any possibility to do so , because it would would n't fit our defi design philosophy . user interface : mm-hmm . but it 's original . project manager : but what w is there some extra marketing : no , that 's true . project manager : maybe i think maybe the kinetic thing is something . instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know , so y so people would n't have to worry about their batteries anymore . maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it industrial designer : but but sometimes you put a project manager : yeah , you leave the p yeah , i know , but still i they will think about that . i mean if you u industrial designer : kinetics are n't uh nowadays only used in watches and that 's because you 're always walking . project manager : the uh it 's made for s people well , the they do n't if it was uh uh r useless technology , they would n't put it uh as a possibility . industrial designer : uh solar cells are useless . project manager : and i it it th th the the target marketing : or the hand dynamo dynamo project manager : the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : because i think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . because it 's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot hey that maybe that 's cool that 's a cool thing about it , you know . you do n't use batteries . marketing : yeah , but but if we ca project manager : i 've never seen it before in a remote control . user interface : but then we could make a docking station . marketing : i do n't know if five minutes . project manager : no , we we we ca n't make a docking station anyway . marketing : that 's not true . project manager : yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one user interface : wow , w why no li marketing : we can make a docking station for two thirty . project manager : we can still make user interface : look at now , we got two industrial designer : fo for a docking station . marketing : two thirty . user interface : two thirty left . ca ca n't we make a docking station of that ? marketing : we can make a docking station . sure . industrial designer : with a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it . marketing : sure . user interface : i do n't know . marketing : the power device is is i i is very cheap . project manager : marketing : that 's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . project manager : yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . industrial designer : wi with a button to user interface : well , we we uh industrial designer : wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . uh , so it 's uh wireless technology . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , but we uh we do n't inc we have n't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff . i do n't think it 's realistic for you to do so . marketing : well then it 's a useless project . industrial designer : look at the case , project manager : oh , because we industrial designer : the case the case of of uh of uh user interface : yeah , then we do n't have any innovation things . project manager : we well look at all the special stuff we have . colour a the colours are special , the form is special . it th this is whole concept . uh maybe it with the kinetic thing , i think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . marketing : ca n't we uh ca n't we say fifteen euros ? project manager : uh , no . user interface : marketing : no , sta yeah i mean industrial designer : no , then we have to sell it for thirty euros . user interface : no , we only make less profit of it . industrial designer : it 's the marketing : you can sell for twenty seven and a half . then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . user interface : no . project manager : yeah , i don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a uh uh i i i i still fee i also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . marketing : i do n't think industrial designer : maybe we can uh can do it both . maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . battery and kinetic . project manager : no , that would n't n no . marketing : thirteen twenty . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : yeah , and it is also not a good it 's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you do n't want it to think about batteries anymore . marketing : and i think only industrial designer : yes , but when it 's then when it marketing : yeah , but only kinetic , then you got ta project manager : no no . industrial designer : then you have to shake it uh and all when it 's when it 's empty . project manager : yeah , it 's great . marketing : you you got ta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . industrial designer : project manager : no no no . no no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : when you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it industrial designer : you asked for three d no , that 's n that 's not true . uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . project manager : it we can make it yeah no . becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it industrial designer : yes , solar cells are also stated . project manager : yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . industrial designer : why do n't we use solar cells then ? project manager : because i think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when i move my remote control around and industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : yeah , it 's funny for a week . i guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . project manager : yeah , but you do n't have to . trust me . the idea of this technology is that you do n't think about it , it just happens . marketing : no , i i do n't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . project manager : okay , then we d okay , well y we do n't have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know . you m have to put something on your box . you have to make people buy it and uh we can really can do the docking thing , uh it 's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it 's would be a easy way out . industrial designer : you can do it for fifty cents . user interface : marketing : well , we 've got more than fifty cents . project manager : okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , industrial designer : the c the case the case alone is is is uh project manager : because uh we only have a minute left or so . industrial designer : the case alone for uh remote control is at least one euro . then we have one euro thirty for the whole docking station . project manager : no no , it 's not possible . okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it 's this is then then our concept is ready . user interface : cheap remote control . project manager : yeah , we make some extra profit of it . marketing : yeah . no , we wo n't , but that 's um something else . user interface : it w it wo n't tell , but industrial designer : but now marketing : no , this not gon na sell . no . project manager : huh , any ideas ? marketing : of course not . user interface : no , uh , n no industrial designer : great . it 's great . user interface : yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . you have to do it over . industrial designer : our remote control . marketing : we come back tomorrow , okay ? project manager : no no uh there 's still there 's still someth concept and something special left . user interface : yeah . the industrial designer : seventy euros . project manager : i mean we 're gon na it 's gon na excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel . user interface : no , but no . project manager : that 's what it 's makes it special . yeah , and i would li i would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and uh i know it will work , but uh it 's it 's an they 're they 're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . industrial designer : why not a hand dynamo then ? user interface : project manager : okay , well we leave it like this . then it 's c then we 're yeah . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : we ca n't do anything else . warning , finish meeting now . industrial designer : we 're done . project manager : okay , project e uh industrial designer : is this it ? project manager : well , we were gon na what look take a look at the last sheet . marketing : yeah , sure . industrial designer : okay . marketing : no , we ca n't . project manager : yeah , we have to yeah , it 's user interface : no . marketing : yes , yes . celebration . i do n't see why , but industrial designer : where 's the champagne ? marketing : i think we got ta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . user interface : yeah ? industrial designer : i do n't uh hear a bell . marketing : no , not yet . industrial designer : user interface : we can do it here then . marketing : alright , i 'll see you guys in a minute . user interface : can we ca n't we do it here ? marketing : i do n't think so . i do n't know . i do n't i do n't think so . user interface : industrial designer : uh-huh . just fill that one in . user interface : yeah , we 're doing now . but it 's . oh , okay . project manager : uh , i do n't know ."
