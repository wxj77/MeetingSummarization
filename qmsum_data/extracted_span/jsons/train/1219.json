    "answer": "eluned morgan am : i think it is important . what we 've said is that we want to maintain that range of learning opportunities that is provided by eu funding . i think we 've got to be clear that we are not working to this scenario . i think we 've got to\u2014 . the uk government have made us some promises and they 've made some commitments , and we need to hold them to that , and so let 's keep the pressure on . the moment we start saying , 'no , it 's all going to be okay , we 'll sort ourselves out'\u2014i think that would be a huge mistake . we have been promised that we will not lose a penny as a result of brexit , and we need to make sure that we keep them to that commitment . i think it was quite interesting to hear what philip hammond said yesterday when he was in wales , saying that the money that we will receive will depend on the future shape of the economy , which implies that he has no idea what 's going to happen there , and that that shared prosperity fund will be designed around the deal . well , that 's really not what we 're interested in . we were made some promises , and we need them to commit to those promises . i think we have some real concerns about the shared prosperity fund not really following through on the commitments that were made during the brexit referendum . but , in terms of the replacements , we 'd be looking at about \u00a315 million a year , and that would be a huge impact for us , but we 're not looking at that\u2014i do n't think we should be\u2014because they made some promises . john griffiths am : so , could you say that , if they keep their promises , then at least that level of funding would be maintained ? eluned morgan am : i think that would be a minimum , but that 's just one aspect of it . that 's not including the whole workplace learning money on top of that . lynne neagle am : thank you . suzy , you had a supplementary . suzy davies am : yes , just very quickly on the multi-annual point , obviously i recognise that we 're talking about six or seven-year cycles with europe , and i completely take the point that you do n't really know from year to year what your budget 's going to be , but welsh government does make multi-annual commitments . i think you did it yesterday , actually\u2014the capital commitment is over more than one year . how are you able to do that and yet not quite feel confident that you can do that with\u2014well , both your sectors , really ? eluned morgan am : i think it 's probably easier to do with capital than it is with revenue , so that 's what would make the difference . but it's\u2014 . these institutions are interested in revenue , because that 's what supports the staff . the one thing we all know is that employment opportunities today\u2014the transitional nature of employment and the fact that people are not getting the kind of contracts that we 'd like them to get\u2014that makes their lives very precarious and they 're less likely , then , to be committed to those institutions . i think it 's a really , really concerning thing , because what makes these institutions work well is their staff , so that makes life very , very difficult without that multi-annual commitment . suzy davies am : they also have to raise some of their own money as well\u2014we must n't forget that . eluned morgan am : no , i think that 's right , and i think that there 's more that these institutions can do in terms of their own funding and being more responsive to employers and the need for skills in their areas . suzy davies am : okay , thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : so , given the precarious state of planning for the finances , are you considering letting universities charge eu students international fees ? kirsty williams am : we do n't regulate the ability for universities to set fees for international students . they would be in a position to\u2014 [ inaudible . ] they are in a position to set international fees at a rate that , i guess , they feel is appropriate for the provision that they give to those students . lynne neagle am : okay , right . we 'll move on , then , to questions from llyr . llyr gruffydd am : thank you . i just wanted to pick up on the funding of apprenticeships and the long-term funding , because the esf\u2014the commitments take us to 2023 , which takes us beyond any transition period . so , i just want to hear from you that there are assurances that the apprenticeship programme can be delivered as a whole , come what may . eluned morgan am : well , we 're fine until 2020 , because we 've had that guarantee from the government . the issue for us is the n+2 that we would have if we do have some kind of transition deal or an agreement with the eu . so , there is a risk and there is concern , beyond 2020 , that that would create problems if they do n't agree to fund that , which is the expectation that we have . llyr gruffydd am : but it is a prospect that this would n't be achieved as you foresee . eluned morgan am : well , we do hope , because we 've had the pledges and commitments from the government , that they will respect what we expected and what was expected by these institutions that have had the commitment of the funding . llyr gruffydd am : so , to what extent does that undermine the current work ? because institutions want to enter into agreements with providers and so on . businesses want to know , if they 're starting on some sort of journey , that they are going to get to the end of it some years down the line . that must be undermining a lot of the work that 's going on now . eluned morgan am : well , as i said , because the guarantee is there until 2020 , i think that , for now , people are willing to go into those agreements , and i hope that we 'll have a better outlook by november of the direction we 're moving in . but i do n't think it 's had an impact . you have to remember that the number of apprenticeships in wales is rising , while they 've collapsed entirely in england . so , it is important that we do continue , and it 's important that we do n't create an atmosphere here that 's going to undermine the confidence of our employers in committing to training in the workplace . llyr gruffydd am : are you confident that the government will achieve its targets in this context ?"
