    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about controlling size of combinatorial input",
    "answer": "professor b : well , here 's the problem . and and uh bhaskara and i was talking about this a little earlier today is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the mode thing . and uh grad a : well i oh yeah , i unders i understand that , i just uh it 's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that . professor b : well , i but that 's what we have to do . ok , so , so , uh . there there are a variety of ways of doing it . uh . let me just mention something that i do n't want to pursue today which is there are technical ways of doing it , uh i i slipped a paper to bhaskara and about noisy - or 's and noisy - maxes and there 're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your bayes - net - edness . uh , so . if you co you could ima and i now i do n't know that any of those actually apply in this case , but there is some technology you could try to apply . grad a : so it 's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that ok . professor b : yeah . yeah . and , um so . grad a : so in that case , the sum we 'd have we i mean , these would n't be the summary nodes . we 'd have the summary nodes like where the things were i guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other professor b : yeah . grad a : yeah . professor b : so what i was gon na say is is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally i mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are . so , if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode , you know , what are the most relevant things . and the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n each node sufficiently narrow that you do n't get this combinatorics . so that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be , ok ? then you could say `` aha , let 's have these three factors `` , ok ? and maybe a binary version f for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one . and then the question would be if if those are the things that you care about , uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about . so that y so that , you know , you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing given that we 're not gon na screw with the technology and just always use uh sort of orthodox bayes - nets , then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that . um and grad a : so what i kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together ? professor b : `` eh - eh - eh . `` yeah . grad a : so that professor b : well , mmm , something . i mean , so uh , robert has thought about this problem f for a long time , cuz he 's had these examples kicking around , so he may have some good intuition about you know , what are the crucial things . and , um , i understand where this the uh this is a way of playing with this abs source - path - goal trajector exp uh uh abstraction and and sort of sh displaying it in a particular way . grad a : yeah . professor b : uh , i do n't think our friends uh on wednesday are going to be able to well , maybe they will . well , let me think about whether whether i think we can present this to them or not . um , uh , grad d : well , i think this is still , i mean , ad - hoc . this is sort of th the second version and i i i look at this maybe just as a , you know , a a whatever , uml diagram or , you know , as just a uh screen shot , not really as a bayes - net as john johno said . grad a : we could actually , y yeah draw it in a different way , in the sense that it would make it more abstract . grad d : yeah . but the uh the the nice thing is that you know , it just is a is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully professor b : alright , well , le let me think about this some more , grad d : and uh professor b : and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that that is helpful to them . grad d : i mean , ultimately we we may w w we regard this as sort of an exercise in in thinking about the problem and maybe a first version of uh a module , if you wan na call it that , that you can ask , that you can give input and it it 'll uh throw the dice for you , uh throw the die for you , because um i integrated this into the existing smartkom system in in the same way as much the same way we can um sort of have this uh this thing . close this down . so if this is what m - three - l um will look like and what it 'll give us , um and a very simple thing . we have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace . professor b : mm - hmm . grad d : and this these uh this changed now only um , um it 's doing it twice now because it already did it once . um , we 'll add some action type , which in this case is `` approach `` and could be , you know , more refined uh in many ways . professor b : mm - hmm . good . grad d : or we can uh have something where the uh goal is a public place and it will give us then of course an action type of the type `` enter `` . so this is just based on this one um , on this one feature , and that 's that 's about all you can do . and so in the f if this pla if the object type um here is is a m is a landmark , of course it 'll be um `` vista `` . and um this is about as much as we can do if we do n't w if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify `` ok , if it 's this and this but that is not the case `` , and so forth , it just gets really really messy . professor b : ok , i 'm sorry . you 're you 're it was much too quick for me . ok , so let me see if i understand what you 're saying . so , i i do understand that uh you can take the m - three - l and add not and it w and you need to do this , for sure , we have to add , you know , not too much about um object types and stuff , and what i think you did is add some rules of the style that are already there that say `` if it 's of type `` landmark `` , then you take you 're gon na take a picture of it . `` grad d : exactly . professor b : f full stop , i mean , that 's what you do . ev - every landmark you take a picture of , grad d : every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible . professor b : you enter you approach . ok . uh , and certainly you can add rules like that to the existing smartkom system . and you just did , right ? ok . grad d : yeah . and it it would do us no good . that ultimately . professor b : well . so , s well , and let 's think about this . um , that 's a that 's another kind of baseline case , that 's another sort of thing `` ok , here 's a another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this `` . add extra properties , a deterministic rule for every property you have an action , `` pppt ! `` you do that . um , then the question would be uh now , if that 's all you 're doing , then you can get the types from the ontology , ok ? because that 's all you 're all you 're using is this type the types in the ontology and you 're done . right ? so we do n't we do n't use the discourse , we do n't use the context , we do n't do any of those things . alright , but that 's but that 's ok , and i mean it it 's again a kind of one minimal extension of the existing things . and that 's something the uh smartkom people themselves would they 'd say `` sure , that 's no problem you know , no problem to add types to the ont `` right ? grad d : yeah . no . and this is just in order to exemplify what what we can do very , very easily is , um we have this this silly uh interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw , and we have our content . now , the content i whi which is sort of what what we see here , which is sort of the vista , schema , source , path , goal , whatever . professor b : yeah . yeah . grad d : this will um be um a job to find ways of writing down image schema , x - schema , constructions , in some some form , and have this be in a in a in the content , loosely called `` constructicon `` . and the rules we want to throw away completely . and um and here is exactly where what 's gon na be replaced with our bayes - net , which is exactly getting the input feeding into here . this decides whether it 's an whether action the the enter , the vista , or the whatever professor b : uh , `` approach `` , you called it , i think this time . grad d : uh approach um construction should be activated , ie just pasted in . professor b : that 's what you said yeah , that 's fine . yeah , but right . but it 's not construction there , it 's action . construction is a d is a different story . grad d : yeah . grad a : right . this is uh so what we 'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic uh like parameters for the for the x - schema ? professor b : for for for yes . yeah . so that that uh i if you had the generalized `` go `` x - schema and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters . grad a : right ."
