    "answer": "user interface : that 's fine . okay so project manager : mm it 's enough . but uh click it on off ? user interface : so you all know me , i 'm the industrial designer . and we 've some basic components that um our remote is gon na need , just basically every remote 'll need 'em . industrial designer : user interface : we need some kinda of power d power source . um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red l_e_d_ , which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal . you need a on-off switch um i do n't know how that got in there . and uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of tvs . so we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that 'll require some memory as well . um so here 's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . you ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red l_e_d_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . so those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around . marketing : now is would this be considered just a standard uh um user interface : i think any des marketing : this is not this is not cutting edge technology we 're talking here . we 're talking about existing technology . user interface : right i think marketing : nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries . user interface : yeah this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gon na be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . we can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , i mean that i mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . marketing : okay . okay . project manager : do we have an idea of costs of different components ? user interface : um well the most the most costly components are gon na be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gon na be expensive as well . project manager : 'kay . user interface : um the l_e_d_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they 're they 're pretty cheap . so depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power . project manager : do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? no . user interface : uh i do n't have any figures right now . project manager : 'kay . user interface : we uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that . project manager : yeah . user interface : um but and i think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , i think . marketing : n okay . mm . mm the shell ? user interface : yeah . basically yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : okay . user interface : so yeah . that 's all i have really ."
