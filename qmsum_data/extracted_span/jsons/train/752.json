    "answer": "john griffiths am : okay . could i then just ask you what you see as the main pressures on the welsh higher education sector at the moment ? bethan owen : the funding position would be the main pressure . the recommendations made by sir ian diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are in the process of being implemented , and the changes to the student finance arrangements will take effect from this september . however , the recommendations for re-establishing funding at welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer . that funding , when it returns to institutions , is intended to re-establish funding for higher cost provision , both full time and part time ; reinstate funding for innovation ; and maintain , at the very least , the research funding in real terms . universities , in the meantime , are trying to minimise the cost reductions that they 're making in order to maintain the infrastructure , so that when the funding comes they can get the best value out of it . we have announced our funding allocations for 2018-19 . for the research and teaching grant , though , we are still funding at a lower level\u2014\u00a312.5 million less\u2014then the starting point for the diamond report , the 2015-16 starting report . but we expect to be able to start introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing diamond . and it 's probably important to note that the diamond recommendations predated brexit , therefore the challenges introduced by brexit are in addition to those that the diamond report was addressing . the other pressures relate to student recruitment . i mentioned the eu and international students . there is also the start of a reduction , both in welsh-domiciled and english-domiciled applications to wales . enrolments are obviously the key important number , which we 'll see later . and the other pressures include pay and pension costs , not least the issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund , where there 's potentially a significant increase in cost . increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure bring a requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing , which bring their own pressures . and finally , the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in england of fees and funding\u2014the augar review . john griffiths am : in terms of european union students and enrolment , is wales forecast to do less well than england and , if so , why might that be ? bethan owen : they are not forecasting it . it 's very difficult until the enrolments are made , and it 's also very hard to see\u2014the data that we see is the ucas data . institutions also recruit directly , so until we see the actual recruitment\u2014 . i think the arrangements that have changed from 2018-19 also impact on eu students . so , now , they have to find the full fee , whereas previously they were getting the grant in the same way as welsh students . so , i 'm speculating that that might be having an impact as well on eu students ' appetite to come ."
