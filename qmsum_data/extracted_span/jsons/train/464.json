    "answer": "project manager : hello again . user interface : hello . industrial designer : hi . marketing : hey , project manager . project manager : user interface : um , project manager , i have something to tell you . project manager : mm yeah . user interface : i have a little problems with my laptop . project manager : okay . user interface : and uh s s s so i had a little less time to complete . project manager : okay . user interface : no , a little problem , uh big problem . i just thought marketing : what was it , problem ? user interface : um , it did n't work anymore . marketing : the laptop ? user interface : the entire windows uh marketing : it hang hung . user interface : it it hung . project manager : marketing : ha-ha . oh . project manager . project manager : yes . yes . industrial designer : marketing : you 're our project manager . project manager : your project manager . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : welcome to the conceptual design meeting industrial designer : marketing : project manager : for real reaction . marketing : project manager : uh , hello again . uh it 's uh the same as the last time . uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations . industrial designer : project manager : and we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . um uh , and at the end , uh i uh , when i finish it off i have some uh input from uh a master class i uh visited . information . marketing : industrial designer : user interface : during lunch , yeah . marketing : master . user interface : he 's the master , yeah . project manager : industrial designer : project manager : the the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on . um uh , our from uh are of two sorts . marketing : master of project manager : components concepts and user interface concepts . uh , the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh well , we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so uh it wo n't be uh uh as breakable . uh how how about the energy ? can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange ? uh , the user interface concept . uh , with the type and uh the the supplements . so uh where to put what button . and uh uh i would say uh jans , can you begin ? industrial designer : yeah , sure . project manager : okay . marketing : project manager : at the end , uh i will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder . industrial designer : okay . uh , let me see . i think it 's this one . ha . right . uh , well , i 'll be talking about the components . marketing : industrial designer : uh , what i did was i reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh below forty five and above . and uh i just uh watch what the differences are and i checked uh , well , what what d do we want , and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group . well uh what i found was that a senior um project manager : industrial designer : senior citizens uh marketing : i 'm sorry . industrial designer : ye ah , it 's it 's okay . marketing : okay . go on . industrial designer : uh they , well , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more . marketing : industrial designer : wood and chrome . project manager : industrial designer : and uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . um , uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials . think of the teletubbies , for instance . project manager : industrial designer : uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and marketing : industrial designer : well uh , shapes are curved and round . marketing : industrial designer : y y you get the picture . and uh they like sports and gaming , and that gives them uh the vitality . uh , so w well uh , firs project manager : one one little question . um about the the material . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh a soft material for a remote control ? industrial designer : no , i 'll i 'll get to that . project manager : okay . yeah . industrial designer : you you 'll see . yeah . project manager : thank you . industrial designer : uh , well f first off , let 's start start with the energy . w i uh i had a choice between uh a few different uh sources . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but uh the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . uh kinetic , that 's when you move something , then uh it gets energy . i figured , well that 's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power . that would be actually very nice , uh i figured . well , we could also use a battery , that 's a bit marketing : yeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ? project manager : user interface : industrial designer : yeah . yeah yeah , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit . marketing : uh , and uh uh industrial designer : and then then it d then it has some more uh energy . project manager : industrial designer : well , y you could just go for a battery . or you can go for both ? user interface : oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? industrial designer : yeah , i actually did . but uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . well , sunlight preferably . user interface : w nah . industrial designer : uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you would n't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . user interface : mm . yeah . industrial designer : uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels , you could actually use uh you could use uh solar panels , but uh you ha you 'd have to implement them into uh the remote control , leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface . marketing : mm yeah . it 's too less space . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so uh so i i it it wo what 's actually i i c just in f i 've figured it out that well , uh seeing that you 'll always be uh within the l uh distance of tv , and the from tv there comes a a a whole bunch of light . so it would actually power itself uh from a tv . marketing : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but , well you just take up all the space , and you would n't uh have the full amount of power actually used . user interface : okay . project manager : but you prefer kinetic ? industrial designer : so i i prefer kinetic because it 's uh well , the costs are n't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . project manager : okay . yeah , but you do n't move a a remote control too much . industrial designer : i mean , if no , but uh d well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y well , you project manager : and that 's enough to to keep the energy level uh industrial designer : yeah , well uh actually it is . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and it it if it is n't , you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again . marketing : project manager : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but , what l what jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you 'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . and for rest , you 'd just add juice on the battery . project manager : okay . marketing : and when the battery does n't work , i usually shake it too . so project manager : thank you , tim . user interface : industrial designer : exactly . marketing : like slamming on it . it 's exactly the same . industrial designer : and so that uh uh well , user interface : industrial designer : f furthermore , you you we uh checked uh the cases . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : we have uh different options uh concerning the cases . you ha i you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh i figured that 's a bit boring . so you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . um , single curve , it 's just a well , uh , you know , it 's just uh a nice curve . or but but you could go in a in an double curves . and that 's like several different dimensions . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : that gives you an whole new uh effec project manager : dynamic dynamic look ? industrial designer : yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , i f i figured . but , that uh we 'll discuss later . marketing : but , are you going to draw it ? industrial designer : what ? user interface : th th yeah . yeah . industrial designer : you want me to draw in three-d_ ? marketing : the yeah . yeah . project manager : marketing : uh , i c i ca n't imagine . industrial designer : uh , yeah , i ca i ca i could i could show you . i could show you . marketing : i ca n't imagine how how how it looks like . user interface : industrial designer : well uh let 's say y uh you uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : let 's say that 's your standard uh marketing : design . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : that 's a bit your d standard design . but you could actually go like uh something like this . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and then uh in three-d_ effect you could go user interface : um marketing : uh project manager : industrial designer : so y you you just yeah , this is a this bit uh difficulty in marketing : user interface : industrial designer : i did n't take a major in art . so but but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth , you could you could uh just play around a bit with . marketing : oh , okay . okay . industrial designer : you you do n't have to use standard uh marketing : oh , okay . project manager : a little artistic . industrial designer : yeah you could y it leaves more space for creativity . project manager : okay . industrial designer : uh that might be an idea , marketing : okay . industrial designer : but just a well , furthermore , uh well , uh plastic versus rubber ? you we could choose uh what uh what 's better , plastic um or rubber . i i ch prefer rubber because it feels uh yeah . project manager : it 's soft . industrial designer : yeah , it 's soft and it 's that i like soft . project manager : that 's the material the younger people want uh , ai n't it ? user interface : industrial designer : yeah , yeah i mean uh plastic uh is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic uh your your i usually associate plastic with uh something that 's cheap . uh that 's maybe just me , but uh , we could uh uh , oh , talk about it later . uh furthermore , buttons . uh traditional uh or a touch screen . well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so i figured i 'll just leave it at the lcd . and uh chip set , well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go uh with a simple chip set . but uh if we decide to go on a n uh um lcd screen , we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set . and that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it . so that 's something we th have to keep in mind . if it is n't uh manageable uh budget-wise , we 'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons . marketing : well , i think uh we 're going to sell tell ten millions of them . so uh i bet a big company in uh korea or taiwan , like uh samsung , can give us uh a big discount on the chips , so industrial designer : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , probably . marketing : u usually , chips are uh are n't more expensive than one dollar . industrial designer : yeah , probably , but but uh yeah , that 's that 's marketing : so that that should n't be a real issue , i think . industrial designer : that should n't should n't be uh that big a issue . i 'll i 'll i 'll just add , uh uh i put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . uh what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ? marketing : user interface : um , i think you should use kinetic as a back-up . industrial designer : yeah , you you you should we should marketing : yeah , a combination . user interface : a combination , yeah . industrial designer : a combination . uh , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . when you pick it up , it charges up . marketing : yeah . like an uh aku uh industrial designer : yeah . marketing : acu uh , yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah , i know . user interface : okay . yeah . project manager : just like the watch from seiko . marketing : well , . yeah . user interface : psycho-kinetic . yeah . industrial designer : yeah , i con exactly . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : what uh what do you think ? project manager : i i uh i would prefer uh both uh too . industrial designer : you agree ? project manager : yeah . combine them . industrial designer : yeah ? both ? marketing : combine them . industrial designer : okay . uh , well that would bring the m m some more costs , but i mean the marketing : okay . industrial designer : who cares , right . project manager : industrial designer : that 's the project manager 's problem . user interface : buy a fifty cents battery and uh marketing : of course . fifty cent . project manager : industrial designer : yeah , well fifty cent uh user interface : industrial designer : uh , why does n't and then we have single-curved versus double-curved . user interface : well maybe i have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that . industrial designer : that okay . no , we 'll we 'll just wait and uh uh , plastic versus rubber . any ideas ? marketing : rubber . project manager : rubber . yeah . industrial designer : uh , rubber ? user interface : um , is n't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you 've got a . industrial designer : you user interface : or do you think it industrial designer : uh , i figured it will be m rather than hard user interface : rubber casing , yeah . industrial designer : nah , rubber c uh this is a casing , yeah . rubber casing , marketing : rather hard . industrial designer : because well if you use an uh d a touch-screen , uh it 's just a casing uh around it . so um , you could go for plastic , but i figured user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : um , well d maybe i can ask it right now the question that i have . industrial designer : i i i would choose rubber . user interface : uh , is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? it is n't , i think , yeah ? industrial designer : well , m i do n't know . no . marketing : well , i think that touch-screens are generally square . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but it 's the case you put around it that makes the shape . user interface : we 're we put fashion in electronics , industrial designer : that is n't user interface : so maybe we can uh marketing : hmm ? yeah okay , but if you have a square uh lcd screen , and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the lcd screen . user interface : mm yeah . industrial designer : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , that would cover it . marketing : that industrial designer : that that would solve the problem . user interface : oh , yeah . okay , i i get it . marketing : that 's it 's custom customisable and project manager : mm yeah . industrial designer : so mm uh uh so uh so what are the opinions ? uh rubber or plastic ? i i i prefer rubber . marketing : yeah , me too . project manager : me too . user interface : okay . project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : yeah , you too ? user interface : that 's good . industrial designer : you sure ? you you you seemed to hesitate a bit . user interface : well , as long a as long as it 's it 's uh it 's firm , and you do n't uh it 's not bendable or something , project manager : marketing : mm yeah . user interface : i th i think that goes too far . industrial designer : yeah , it it should n't it should n't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh project manager : okay . user interface : oh . industrial designer : no , that that that that 's gon na the the chip set will hold it firm in place , marketing : user interface : okay . industrial designer : and uh and and uh and a lcd screen also user interface : it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . industrial designer : yeah it m might it might . project manager : user interface : okay . marketing : industrial designer : uh , tra uh traditional versus lcd , well i figured we we all set on that . marketing : industrial designer : and uh , then also the simple versus advanced . well i figure if we go for l_ lcd , we we should have the advanced . project manager : mm yeah . industrial designer : so that should n't be a problem . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : okay , well that 's my uh project manager : thank you . industrial designer : uh , you 're welcome . marketing : can i uh do my thing ? project manager : yeah . do your thing , tim . marketing : it uh user interface : do your thing . industrial designer : project manager : bring it on . marketing : expert map . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : okay uh last week project manager : marketing : i went to uh paris and milan for some trend-watching . industrial designer : marketing : for marketing . our research and development department and i went to paris and milan . in paris and milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um what they like in design uh and material nowadays . findings . our main audience , uh so that 's people below forty , uh prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . project manager : marketing : very basic colours , like janus explained . um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow . project manager : marketing : um , considering material , um yeah . they like spongy material , industrial designer : user interface : spongeball . marketing : like yeah a sponge-ball . user interface : marketing : like a s soft material . project manager : yeah . marketing : janus m uh mentioned it also . i think he did some uh some findings himself . industrial designer : well , the teletubbies sh project manager : marketing : you wer you were n't in paris ? okay . like this . like big uh g flashy colours . fresh . project manager : flashy . yeah . marketing : it 's nice , i think . okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . uh yeah , uh materials like wood that project manager : yeah , but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of . industrial designer : well , you could . you you could . marketing : no n j just j just a w project manager : yeah but never seen one . user interface : it 'll float . marketing : no , okay , but just just a wooden uh look . project manager : case . oh , a wooden look , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor . user interface : tables . project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : the that is n't wood anyway , but okay ? but , that 's our secondary audience . project manager : yeah . marketing : so , uh we decided to take mm yeah the people below forty . project manager : yeah . marketing : so , that this does n't apply . 'kay , the third . uh , there 're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . they have to look fancy . um , they should be technological in innovative . that means uh there have to be fancy things in . uh , and easy to use . but that 's common . my personal preferences . we have to aim at a mu at the main audience . and uh , therefore use fresh colours . project manager : would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or marketing : uh , i 'll i 'll come to that in a second point . project manager : okay . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : like the nokia uh the removable covers , uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . project manager : yeah . okay . marketing : uh , a third , material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber . um , two advantages . uh , it fits within the current market trends . and uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it . so uh to come back to your question , i think uh and the people in milan and paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard . like uh seen on regular mobile phones . actually , they have a lot in common . the phones and the project manager : industrial designer : well , i actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so yeah . marketing : yeah . yeah . okay . project manager : maybe you could use your remote as a phone . user interface : hey . project manager : there are numbers on it , so uh industrial designer : that might be a next step . marketing : yeah , exactly . project manager : marketing : uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition . user interface : marketing : uh , it 's very innovative . innovative . project manager : so that you say um s_p_s_s_ , and it goes to uh marketing : yeah , like something . project manager : okay . marketing : you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak uh speech recognition and stuff . but , we have to keep the cost in uh in mind , but it user interface : twelve fifty uh marketing : yeah , it it can be uh very expensive . project manager : marketing : 'kay , second . project manager : marketing : uh , building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . industrial designer : marketing : uh , also the link with uh mobile phones . uh project manager : yeah , but you do n't use that th games when you watching television , i think . industrial designer : well , yeah . marketing : no , but no , okay . but you do n't use games when you 're d when you 're making a telephone call . it 's just the same . user interface : when your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . project manager : marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , okay . marketing : when you 're at college . project manager : you take your remote control with you . user interface : take it . industrial designer : you take your uh remote with you to school . marketing : uh no . you al you also take uh t industrial designer : yeah . marketing : you take your ipac and go uh play games . yeah . yeah . well , i do that , but okay , and um project manager : industrial designer : marketing : and third , i stick with it , the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . user interface : ooh . s industrial designer : very nice . marketing : that 's it . project manager : uh great . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : marketing : project manager : user interface : in okay . um the interface contents . well that 's a just simple powerpoint mock-up i want to m make it more as dynamic for you so i 'll draw there . but , the main concept is um take one big touch screen . um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space . and uh make the menu structure changeable . so if you press um system , that 's marketing : user interface : yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in . or maybe even a step further when you want to um t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . and um other buttons can may be displayed here if that 's necessary . and um well , how do uh do we want to look at uh uh f um yeah does a remote look well , it 's you 've got ta hold it in one hand . so um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . and some remotes you can use with your thumb . but i think that 's too difficult for this one . so you can make it s a little broader . yeah . and here ? and maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons . and use your other hands on the menu structure . so here are gon na be the program buttons . one , two , three , four , et cetera . and the the volume control and program control maybe . and , down here , um , i added , this could be one uh big lcd . um , the menu structure . so you can use it in uh in this way . um one thing you 've got ta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . project manager : user interface : um , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , um and well , i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . but if you 're programming the colour of the tv , do not display twenty other options that are possible . just keep it as simple as uh as possible . and do not use too many levels . do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and um push plus twenty times . project manager : user interface : but just the um uh just in one button if possible . and um , well , you kn you all know the tv levels . um , channel one , two . and when you get to n to uh to ten , ye and want to go back , uh well you have a problem . just m most most modern tvs , you you press one zero , and it goes to ten . and else , to one and through after that . so the s a button less . and um , things like teletext , put them in the menu . things like um um yeah . marketing : yeah . uh , what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button ? project manager : user interface : yeah , yeah w yeah , i i find i must trying to uh tell it . marketing : l like in uh internet explorer . user interface : is uh volume plus and minus ? and this is program uh plus and minus . uh marketing : yeah okay , but does it that is for uh going from four to five . but if you go from two to eight , and you want user interface : or if you 're watching studio sports on uh on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two marketing : yeah , and on two . that you can switch switch easy . user interface : well yes , i think that 's a good idea . but um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . marketing : yeah it is . yeah . user interface : and if you 're using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . you just do n't have to play games uh in-between . but if you 're really switching between two channels , you wo n't have time uh to d use the other options . marketing : mm no . user interface : um , yeah already already told that . marketing : that 's it . user interface : yeah . that 's my conclusion . project manager : oh , okay . marketing : okay . project manager : uh i think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh tim uh came with . the parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . marketing : industrial designer : project manager : uh industrial designer : project manager : there 's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh i think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . i do n't know how you think about it . marketing : yeah . user interface : well , i agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . project manager : yeah . user interface : um , yeah um system properties , um parental control . marketing : yeah but what i see uh how i see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a windows log-on screen with parents , children . user interface : yeah . mm . project manager : yeah . marketing : something like that . user interface : um , w well , yeah . marketing : and w when you want to use the parents uh option , you have to user interface : it it has to be fast . you do n't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . marketing : yeah , ok project manager : no but i think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children do n't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television , and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that . user interface : mm-hmm . why mm-hmm . you c may use like when there 's uh x_p_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . project manager : uh marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . pu push parents . user interface : and if you push parents , then marketing : that then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in . user interface : yeah . to log in . yeah . and if you puts a ye marketing : like two one three . project manager : yeah . user interface : uh-huh . marketing : and it 's in . user interface : and if you w you push p children , uh you do n't have to uh log in , but you can only watch uh children 's channels or uh marketing : it automatically goes yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : okay . well industrial designer : i do n't know if it 's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . because well it 's a simple function , but it 's gon na take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it . because you 'll have to start working with the profiles and such . and i 'm not sure if it 's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : well i think that 's a b there 's a big market for it , industrial designer : i do n't know what project manager : because uh you yeah , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that uh that he yeah , they believe that children uh are influenced by the television , industrial designer : marketing : mm yeah . v violent tv . project manager : and uh well , we 're we 're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years . but there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh user interface : yeah . well , maybe um some idea on that . project manager : yeah . user interface : just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , project manager : yeah . user interface : 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he would n't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do . marketing : yeah , of course . project manager : yeah . user interface : just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something . project manager : yeah yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : that 's a that 's a better idea ? marketing : yeah , w it just has to be w when it 's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . project manager : yeah . yeah , okay . marketing : but if you want to install it personally uh if i got kids , and i could choose between uh two remote controls . one uh w with parent control and one without , and i would would buy the one with . project manager : yeah , with and one without . yeah . user interface : um , b well , still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones . marketing : i th yeah . user interface : you 're thinking about some channels they uh can not see , but well , i i when i think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come industrial designer : marketing : user interface : and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels , marketing : yeah . user interface : because if you 're watching uh , i do n't know , you 're in the at day uh , cartoons will come up m on maybe friday night . i do n't know . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : yeah , maybe it can work with show view . uh , you you can control your video recorder with show view . user interface : project manager : uh , when you tick in a number , it will uh start and end uh recording . but maybe there 's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . user interface : yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all , project manager : yeah . that 's true . yeah . user interface : will have to decide uh marketing : yeah but yeah but that is n't possible . user interface : that is n't possible . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but , well , if you want to i i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let 's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the tv and presses up for instance . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : well uh , nob nobody 's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel . user interface : well , yeah you could say if parental control is only it it 'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but industrial designer : but that well , i 'm not sure because um for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control , so it would , yeah , have to be constant uh constant signalling . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : what m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . and that uh provides parental control , for instance . and that 's just an optional uh device . so there 's n that 's there 's uh besides uh the remote control , you 'll have a separate uh project manager : i would n't put it in an optional device . that that then then then it becomes too much , i think . industrial designer : yeah ? project manager : if we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise . marketing : yeah , and user interface : yeah , on a separate menu uh option . marketing : and and you know w uh when you install another device , uh children can still go up to the tv , p pop open uh the thing and and and g project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , that 's true . that 's true , marketing : go to a channel . industrial designer : but uh at same instant , same happens when uh you have remote control . so marketing : yeah , yeah of course . but industrial designer : but , only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , project manager : industrial designer : and those people would n't uh necessary want it . marketing : yeah . ah it 's industrial designer : so , you you 'd be marketing : yeah . yeah , okay . but it 's just an an added feature feature . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . and what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? i personally think that that becomes too much . user interface : yeah , well yeah , i project manager : it 's more like it gets you to the functionality , but user interface : a mail too from management that it 's very popular to use voice recon recognition . project manager : yeah . user interface : but i do n't think when you 're watching tv uh , hearing loud noises from the tv , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , uh yeah . marketing : mm yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , i think . but project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . project manager : and games ? marketing : games . it does n't industrial designer : yeah . i can see games happening . yeah . user interface : w you can put it on chip anyway , so uh marketing : yeah . project manager : that would user interface : as long as it 's is n't a primary feature of the remote , marketing : that that does n't c that does n't co user interface : but uh marketing : yeah , that that does n't cost a lot of extra resources , i think . project manager : okay . so that will uh that that that must be in it , you think ? industrial designer : yeah , that will be nice . project manager : okay . so the games uh are in it . the voice recognition are not . and the parental control are user interface : optional in project manager : optional ? marketing : yeah , it 's it 's in it . but too ma i i think so , but user interface : but how we do it ? project manager : yeah . user interface : well , i think also it 's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . so we should make it too complex . project manager : okay . user interface : is t some menu uh function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . marketing : yeah . user interface : but uh how how it 's gon na work uh uh will f be a problem . project manager : yeah , okay . uh , but uh will there uh uh like the first idea uh from uh you can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? or are we going to put it in and uh just uh user interface : mm-hmm . well ye i i think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option . marketing : to put user interface : you can put on marketing : yeah , to put it in always . project manager : yeah ? user interface : yeah . and you can just uh s when you buy it , you can select um personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something . project manager : mm yeah . industrial designer : well , i do n't know . i i figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . so you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . but it would would be uh more expensive . so , a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model . could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model , uh for instance . user interface : oh , it 's a p yeah . marketing : yeah , but tvs are n't capable of sending . industrial designer : yes they are . yeah . marketing : yeah ? i thought they were just project manager : yeah , you yo industrial designer : yeah , you you have some tvs any marketing : a able to receive . yeah , some . but project manager : yeah , but most often not . industrial designer : yeah . that is true , that is true . user interface : well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you can not watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you can not watch all channels after ten o'clock . marketing : yeah . user interface : and there 's just some little uh clock in the remote . industrial designer : well yeah , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control . marketing : yeah , j just some rules . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but you still have the problem about uh the television itself . user interface : no , no , it 's very simple . there uh th i h i 've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . industrial designer : yeah , yeah yeah . user interface : so , the remote does does n't transmit when it 's after twelve clock . marketing : yeah , okay . but , on the tv user interface : yeah ? marketing : at least my tv , is a is a compartment which you can press . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and there are buttons uh behind it which you can use , if you d if you do n't if you do n't have a industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . well , that 's to put it very blunt , that 's not our problem . just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh it 's not not a part of the remote . marketing : yeah . yeah . yeah , of course . industrial designer : yeah , that is true . yeah , that is true . user interface : you have to f yeah . industrial designer : yeah , you could you could you could go like user interface : uh , or make it ourselves very diffic industrial designer : uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , i figured i figure we could do that . yeah , yeah , sure . project manager : user interface : okay . industrial designer : uh , i 'm not sure what marketing thinks about it , but marketing : or j yeah . user interface : marketing : ah project manager : marketing : i have to uh consult my legal advisor about it . project manager : okay . so uh i think we have decided on the things that uh from janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : the case will be double-curved and uh rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : the buttons will be uh touch-screen . uh but there may not be too many buttons . and in the the menu structure , uh there must not to be uh five minutes to go . uh , too uh too many levels . and uh it must be easy to use . the parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . and the games are in it . so marketing : project manager : i think we have uh we have decided uh , okay . user interface : okay . marketing : consensus . project manager : uh , little more . marketing : oh . oh . i i have one thing left . project manager : yeah . marketing : maybe for uh jerome . user interface : yeah ? i 'm listening . marketing : um , the views . maybe it 's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view . project manager : like a like a moat or s or something . yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : um , well industrial designer : user profile . marketing : like at in the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons . project manager : yeah , but you have that in the user interface : what i was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you do n't use it is simple . project manager : yeah . you use the user interface : and when you push uh system properties , uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . it 's already incorporated a little in that concept . marketing : mm yeah , okay . fairly enough . yeah . industrial designer : well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users . marketing : yeah , wh which buttons you like or not . industrial designer : yeah , which buttons do you want to in it . because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . marketing : yeah . yeah . just leave the other numbers away . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah , you could you could m have people want uh want that . project manager : we take it to the other meeting , okay ? i have a little w uh little chat to do marketing : okay . go on . industrial designer : ah , yeah , sure . project manager : and uh then we uh finish . marketing : a little chat . project manager : i went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us . industrial designer : project manager : first thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management . knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge , uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that . marketing : project manager : it 's it 's uh very hot at the moment , marketing : project manager : so it 's it 's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh marketing : marketing . project manager : marketing or did i said management ? marketing : management . project manager : oh . just talking about myself . marketing : yeah , that 's my function , to industrial designer : project manager : uh w user interface : marketing : okay . go on . project manager : what other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some uh yeah . import export . marketing : project manager : and uh another one . industrial designer : user interface : som some bench-marker . project manager : uh , they 're a ha they 're at yeah , benchmarking , that 's the word i saw . marketing : project manager : i uh could n't uh okay , uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey , and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us . so , we must uh we must bring it as if uh real reaction is uh is big company , uh a trustful company , and uh it has m marketing : how i know a marketing name for our product . project manager : okay . marketing : r_ th r_ to the third power . project manager : marketing : r_ three . real reaction remote . project manager : i had a i had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh real reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing . marketing : mm-hmm ? project manager : when you uh put on remote , you see a kind of a just like when you telephone , you see a little uh animation . user interface : uh , logo . yeah ? marketing : bling . project manager : real reaction remote . user interface : yeah . marketing : project manager : and uh with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . and then you go uh marketing : yeah . user interface : marketing : yeah , okay , but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and project manager : the user interface : yeah . well , you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they 'll still remember it . project manager : yeah . but w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own . marketing : yeah . user interface : and it it l linger on every time you see it . industrial designer : well , if you if you have the l lcd screen , you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and it could just stay there . marketing : that spins around like all the time . project manager : mm yep , yeah . user interface : very annoying . industrial designer : yeah , that spins around or something . project manager : also also . but we we are uh marketing : it it 's just like a uh globe in internet explorer . project manager : yeah yeah y yeah yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , something like that . a small icon . project manager : okay , but uh think about that kind of things . user interface : yeah , i it 's ok for f project manager : that 's what they said in the master class . . marketing : okay . user interface : oh , for the next meeting , right ? industrial designer : marketing : project manager : n uh , next meeting starts in thirty minutes . marketing : who uh
