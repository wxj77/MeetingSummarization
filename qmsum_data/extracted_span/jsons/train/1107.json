    "answer": "project manager : hello . marketing : hey guys . industrial designer : i see my bunny is still standing . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : no one drawing it . project manager : it 's too beautiful . user interface : yeah , true . industrial designer : uh i figured uh that much . project manager : marketing : too wicked . project manager : a minute please , my uh laptop is uh oh , there it is , thank you . so welcome back . at the functional design meeting um the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . i will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that i have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that uh now or afterwards . um uh i had an email from the from the management board marketing : project manager : uh , i do n't know if you a al also uh received it , but there were four points uh which uh i think are very important . first one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . uh second one is also important uh , because it 's one of the discussion points of the previous session . uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it uh not gon na it 's not gon na be a multi-purpose remote control , so uh that 's one thing to keep in mind . user interface : marketing : project manager : uh second , and i think that 's important for the marketing uh expert , uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . uh and uh i think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . marketing : project manager : so , we have uh forty minutes , so i think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each , and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either smartboards , the the word files , what you uh whatever you want . so uh tim , can you start ? yeah ? marketing : okay . 'kay , welcome . i have some uh new findings on uh marketing expert level , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : which i will show you . the method i used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . um one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results . um , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . um , we have three audiences of two audiences , i 'm sorry . uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five . um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five . uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . mm and some interests from the from the age groups , uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an lcd screen on the remote control , um speech recognition . i do n't think that 's uh really appropriate . um , and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh yeah , they do n't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . so that 's maybe something for the user interface uh designer . okay , third findings . according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um following buttons are most important . um , i will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . um , persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . um , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . switching channels , um yeah , that 's pretty uh pretty normal , that 's what you do with a remote control . um the second , teletext , uh and the third , uh volume controls . um , i think it 's good uh that we know what the user want wants , uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear . project manager : but it 's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet . so that that 's strange . marketing : yeah , okay . yeah , okay , but uh at the moment uh teletext is yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on tv , like getting information . project manager : yeah , okay . yeah . marketing : so uh , when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . project manager : okay . yeah , okay . marketing : that 's ridiculous . project manager : yeah . marketing : that 's a ne i it it 's a new technology , project manager : yeah . marketing : but it 's not incorporated right now . okay , my personal preferences . um , i think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five . mm , first of all um it 's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . uh second , i think you will get the most revenue from i from it . um , yeah , people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of tv , more than uh people who are el uh elder . um second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as i said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire , uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it 's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the tv project manager : yeah , that 's a cool idea . marketing : where you can put the the remote control in . um , that 's about it , i think . yeah . industrial designer : when you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about ? marketing : uh not not the r not the functions , industrial designer : uh , the funtionability . marketing : but uh it came out that a lot of buttons were n't even used uh on a remote control . so you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , but if you do n't use them , yeah it 's project manager : yeah . industrial designer : ah okay , so focusing more on the used buttons . marketing : yeah , they have to be on it industrial designer : yeah . marketing : j just to t to get it done if necessary , user interface : marketing : but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or industrial designer : could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example . marketing : yeah , perhaps . industrial designer : thank you . marketing : just for the minor functions perhaps . industrial designer : yeah , ma perhaps , just just an idea . marketing : just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah ? 'kay , that 's it . project manager : thank you , tim . janus , can you uh industrial designer : uh yeah yeah , i 'll go , sure . right uh , i 'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . well uh what i did was i dissected uh uh current remote controls and um i viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . and uh after that i put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and i 'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . and i 'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why i think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . um right . uh well what i did was uh i i checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . and the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a tv or uh a stereo or something , and those uh have a transmitter that 's also focused on infrared , so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with bluetooth for instance then uh the tv should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that 's that would n't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us . so that 's probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote . well uh as i mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth well it may be possible , but uh i figured it would n't be possible in within our budget , but that 's not for me to decide , but that 's maybe something for marketing to look into . f because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh bluetooth or or radio waves , although marketing : what do you think about uh incorporating bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the tv , connected to the tv ? industrial designer : yeah , actually i have t marketing : so it 's in the wrong product . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , i actually i figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you 'd still have the uh the infrared function . so in in theory you 'd actually just move the problem , marketing : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : but uh what i did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , user interface : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , i dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be . but it may be uh may be something to explore . uh i 'll i 'll just explain a bit of the components . uh first you have the energy source . the energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere . i figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one . so we did n't and we do n't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that . uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch there is a switch uh between these . when the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , and in uh immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened . that 's uh that 's so the h user wo n't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . or i press button but nothing 's happening on the tv , so is is something wrong or something . so that 's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user . uh w well the signal goes via chip that 's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it 's processed and then it 's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . and those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . uh well my personal preferences here , well we have to keep it simple . not too many uh gadgets and functions , just like you said uh well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use you do n't use them , so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those . uh i i think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . so uh no input from the television . so i think we should n't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that , because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you 'd have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from uh what 's on tv and such . so i figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and marketing : um , yeah , maybe another problem uh , i think current tvs can even send infrared . industrial designer : yes , but what should we uh s i i i f i agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ? 'cause that would be i mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . industrial designer : these all uh all stuff that we have to take in account . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so i i my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . um , well marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we should uh look into the design and the functionability . like i said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh stuff . and uh do n't overbuild , we should n't make a big uh remote control for simple functions , but we we should stick to the basics . so that was my uh my personal opinion . and that was my uh my presentation uh project manager : okay , thank you janus . user interface : okay . yes , project manager : you do ? user interface : i can go ahead . project manager : the last presentation . you have plenty of time , user interface : last presentation . okay . project manager : tim and uh janus do n't uh talk to ten minutes , industrial designer : project manager : so uh take your time . marketing : project manager : if you take your time too long i will uh eventually uh industrial designer : project manager : warn you . user interface : marketing : user interface : well , i 'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions . project manager : user interface : um what 's my opinion about what 's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that should n't weigh over the uh if it 's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness , so tha that 's that 's some of the main points . and another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult , so use as as little functions as possible or at least do n't display them all at once on the same remote . if you have fifty functions you do n't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time , 'cause when you visit an internet uh site you do n't want fifty links uh to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure . marketing : user interface : and uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , but s i do n't know in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote can not receive anything , but uh we might uh consider that . um well , of course i i hope this is all clear to you . if you you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but well , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . you have to be very careful what you push , marketing : user interface : and um if you 're looking for teletext you 'll be uh searching for half an hour from uh um yeah well , where is it ? where the hell he here i guess and , yeah , when you have to uh use something else . so just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . for example if you want to use a play and back and stop , that 's very important . um well this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but um it 's no longer uh applying . well yeah , i prefer to use it only for tv and um n uh not to give too many options and and if possible , uh the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select project manager : uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one , so uh user interface : yeah , project manager : you you want to keep it simple , user interface : and so that 's where the difficulties lie . industrial designer : yeah , but project manager : but i think that if you want to do that , then you ca n't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one . user interface : yeah , this so that 's the thing you have to weigh against each other . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , but user interface : do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought , project manager : mm-hmm . okay . user interface : or do we want to use um many buttons . project manager : yeah . user interface : so um weighing those factors . marketing : hmm it 's maybe an option uh if you use an lcd or a touch screen um , that in the middle are the the main keys , like displayed on the user interface : marketing : uh yeah . user interface : the does n't . marketing : . yeah , this ? no ? yeah . something like that . okay , just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching , user interface : yeah . marketing : and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down . user interface : yeah , but when all the questions i had do we want to use uh a menu display on the tv ? or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? 'cause if you use a memory display on the tv , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . uh so that 's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , um display the menu on the tv marketing : nah . mm-hmm . user interface : and do n't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , marketing : yeah . user interface : is too complicated for most users . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , but marketing : i think so too , but and that 's partly because um uh a lot of tvs have different menus , and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that do n't correspond to the menu what 's actually on tv . user interface : yeah , that will be a problem . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : you d you have to keep in mind that uh several tvs uh do n't even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not our remote wo n't be able to work on all televisions . and that would be uh a considerable problem . user interface : so if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah , the restrictions of what 's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : use big clear buttons . not too many . so maybe we 'll loose a few option uh options , but i think i this is more important . um especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen . industrial designer : not embed yeah , but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something . user interface : and yeah , if you want to uh uh s put on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . not first change menu options or switch something . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : um , well yeah , as you already told , give some feedback . if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and um , well , my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , keep it simple . so uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the the television , some you you 'll never know uh and never use , and therefore it 's uh important marketing : yeah . user interface : if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they 're not in the way for the for the most important functions . marketing : yeah . uh , i think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good . um , because recently uh i saw news item on tv um about uh new telephones uh for elder people . um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , um and that 's a big ad advantage i think , because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : it 's uh very visual intended . what was i to say more ? user interface : maybe that 's an option . um keep the primary buttons visible . uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands marketing : yeah . user interface : and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form . project manager : user interface : but uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear industrial designer : user interface : and maybe use a touch screen , or if that 's uh will become too difficult just uh like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it 's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . um marketing : yeah okay , but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea user interface : yeah . marketing : then what 's gon na be displayed on the touch screen ? industrial designer : the extra functions . user interface : the extra functions , you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , marketing : yeah , but l like menu functions or industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and then all all the options will become available marketing : ah okay . user interface : and you just c s yeah t scroll through them . industrial designer : would n't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet marketing : yeah , i think so . industrial designer : and uh i 'll just make um uh let 's say fifteen buttons on it , and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with or sub-items , sub-functions . user interface : well um marketing : yeah . user interface : then i 'd like to make a proposal . marketing : user interface : if you make one big touch screen , industrial designer : yes . user interface : use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : like like the ipod idea that that we just saw . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on . uh uh i think that will be great . user interface : okay . project manager : so you think it 's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . marketing : yeah , i think so . industrial designer : yeah , i wou i would actually go for the project manager : jirun ? user interface : okay , i agree , but i think it 's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , of course . user interface : and so um an elder designer picks up th the of industrial designer : yeah . user interface : an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who 's all in the systems functions , you 'll have to have the possibility to turn off the tv or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . project manager : yeah yeah yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah , i had another uh idea about maybe parental control . um , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : like building in uh some kind of pin code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh user interface : yeah . marketing : but children uh if children do n't do n't know the pin code , they ca n't switch to uh violent uh channels or user interface : yeah wh is that possible to use or no ? industrial designer : that is possible , that well that actually depends on the television , marketing : th there 's just user interface : well , yeah well , industrial designer : but i think i figure that would be user interface : does it have to depend on the television ? marketing : ju just a simple log-in , something like that . industrial designer : well , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels , the the channels are different on each te television , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : they are n't set in a preset order , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so uh if you uh lock on a remote , uh let 's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , marketing : mm-hmm . yeah , okay . industrial designer : so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : well , i think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the tv match , and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children can not use this uh change the settings of the tv , like colour and then volume marketing : yeah . user interface : and uh marketing : yeah , th that kind of stuff , but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : and like uh oh , that 's channel fifteen , that 's uh vi violent channel , user interface : oh , something like that . marketing : uh m my ki my kids uh i do n't want my kids to watch that , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : then you set the priority to only parents , industrial designer : project manager : okay , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : well b but make it a separate option in the menu , industrial designer : yeah , that would b marketing : for example . but industrial designer : yeah , that . user interface : so that it 's it 's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here , marketing : yeah okay , but but yeah , that 's just user interface : so uh parents uh marketing : that 's an a an added feature . project manager : yeah . okay . but let 's not uh go too wide about the those things , that 's that why we 're here . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , th th those things are nice . project manager : it 's it 's a nice idea , but i think that 's we wel later in the stage . i 've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p marketing : partial . project manager : yeah , a partial , uh because i think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals marketing : yeah . project manager : uh and uh the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible . marketing : yeah , but but if you display it on lcd screen with r r really big numbers user interface : yeah , you can de display it on the on the old style . marketing : that 's just as e just as easy . industrial designer : uh . i i do user interface : you can display actual buttons on the touch screens . project manager : yeah . yeah , that 's true , that 's true . industrial designer : uh i do agree , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : because well , it 's just not the same when you touch a touch screen user interface : yeah , okay . industrial designer : or when you touch a button , but well we have to look at what 's our target uh audience . marketing : yeah , it 's different . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : w we are aiming for younger people project manager : yeah , that 's true , yeah . industrial designer : and they they chose marketing : yeah , age b below forty . project manager : yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that 's a good point . yep . industrial designer : so that 's that 's probably uh a marketing : and th those young people , yeah . y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff , project manager : mm-hmm . they like the fancy stuff , yeah . that 's true . marketing : so a touch screen , like microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : i th i think we can do that too . project manager : mm yeah . okay , as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh are done . marketing : done . project manager : uh i 've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : um each time i uh i had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . uh so that can be uh can be read out . uh a f a few things i uh i noticed uh were um moment . ooh . uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is i think uh how uh it 's going to look uh with uh we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they do n't uh you do n't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wan na use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television . i think that 's the point what uh user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : we discussed . marketing : yeah , yeah , some of them . the menus uh are not identical for all th for all tvs , so you have to display it on one uh tv . user interface : well you can use um when you uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the tv , marketing : yeah , but that 's not possible . user interface : then there 's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume marketing : mm-hmm , mm yeah . user interface : and um well maybe we can look out if there 's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda tv it is , from ah , it 's a philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t project manager : yeah , but you have uh uh an marketing : add th that that 's an opportunity . project manager : yeah , but you have an international market range , so you have i think a big range of user interface : well there are universal d um um remotes project manager : yeah . user interface : and they all have a functionality for all the tvs , uh so this would n't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these . project manager : okay . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but they marketing : but project manager : and it 's not too complex to do it . industrial designer : well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your tv project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and that that is bit of a tricky job . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i actually use one of those when they are they are kinda kinda troublesome , but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , because uh in order for the remote to process something from the tv , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive , user interface : yeah . well yeah . mm-hmm . oh um mo industrial designer : and that 's well marketing : no no no . user interface : no , you can just say uh the c marketing : he he he he me he means just just one other thing . project manager : just build it in . user interface : yeah . marketing : uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press yeah , you have to press a code for tv . industrial designer : yeah . yes . user interface : in codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . you look up , i have a philips h_ fifty five industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and it says press code four five five marketing : yeah . industrial designer : oh , okay , yeah , sure , uh user interface : and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah . user interface : and it displays all your uh menu options . industrial designer : oh , yeah yeah , sure , that would be possible , yeah . marketing : yeah . now we uh just connect uh the tv type uh to a set of options , in just just in the memory , user interface : memory in the in the remote . industrial designer : profiles . marketing : so that if you yeah , like profile , so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of tv uh industrial designer : yeah . marketing : the memory uh pops up the options . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , that would be possible . yeah , sure . project manager : okay . marketing : i th do n't think that 's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables . industrial designer : no , that would n't be uh user interface : yeah , well um industrial designer : yeah , a few variables . user interface : if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds tvs at maximum . if you have all of them , all the old and new tvs summed up , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : so uh i think uh it is possible . industrial designer : ah it is . it is definitely po marketing : but , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new tv that is n't incorporated in the remote project manager : we have five minutes to go . user interface : yeah . well then you have to buy a new one , it 's very good for marketing marketing : new remote ? user interface : maybe , or an update , software update . marketing : a firmware upgrade or something , user interface : firmware update , you say . industrial designer : yeah , firmware upgrade . marketing : but from where ? ah . maybe w industrial designer : that 's maybe the cup holder . marketing : no m may no , user interface : yeah . marketing : maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh u_s_b_ or a firewire connection , so that you can uh connect it to the p_c_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet . industrial designer : well , not everybody has uh has uh a p_c_ at home . well the most most people have , user interface : well , at industrial designer :
