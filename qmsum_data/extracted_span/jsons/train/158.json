    "answer": "mr. gabriel ste-marie ( joliette , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . regardless of the covid-19 pandemic , the last time i checked , we still had a democratic system and the government had to remain accountable . the government needs to present a picture of the economic situation and a picture of its overall emergency measures . does the government intend to extend the measures over the summer ? if so , how will it do so ? the government must also present its working scenarios for the economic recovery . the government needs to be transparent . when will the government provide its economic update ? hon . bill morneau : mr.chair , i would like to thank the hon . member for his questions . i agree , it is very important to be transparent and to provide the necessary information to canadians . every day , we announce measures , of course , but also the cost of the measures and the amount of the investments . it is very important . the challenge at the moment is the economic situation , which is very fluid . when the situation is more stable , we will have the opportunity to give an economic update . mr. gabriel ste-marie : in my opinion , mr.chair , it will really be too late to do the economic update when things are more stable . we have been asking for an economic update for the past month . even the parliamentary budget officer has been urging the government to table an economic update in a timely manner . with only three weeks left in the house before the summer , the clock is ticking . the quebec government will table its economic update later this month . will the federal government follow suit ? hon . bill morneau : mr.chair , let me confirm that we will continue to be transparent about the investments ; it is very important . of course , each day we work to make sure we have a solid grasp of the economic situation . as i said , when the situation is a little more stable , we will have the opportunity to explain our situation with an economic update . mr. gabriel ste-marie : once again , mr.chair , when the situation is more stable , it will be too late to do an economic update ; instead we will have to table a budget with the recovery in mind . speaking of the recovery , the parliamentary budget officer is surprised that the government is calling on the private sector for ideas for its recovery plan . mr.giroux points out that this government has thousands of public servants with very good ideas , and he adds that the government can also ask for the opposition parties ' views . that would be a very good idea . why is the government contracting out the development of its recovery plan to the private sector ? hon . bill morneau : mr.chair , i would like to tell the hon . member that it is important to listen to what we are trying to do , and to listen to people 's ideas and opinions , not only in parliament , but also from our society . so we keep listening . of course , with our approach , we will address the economic recovery in a way that will ensure we can maintain our very strong position . mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , we are still surprised that the government has contracted out its recovery plan to the private sector . the sooner the government tables its recovery plan , the better . businesses and individuals would start gaining confidence in the economy again . it would help them to loosen the purse strings and be assured that there will be economic life after the pandemic . again , that is what the parliamentary budget officer says . can the government tell us when it will table its recovery plan ? hon . bill morneau : mr.chair , we feel it is very important to consider what we need to do in each phase of our recovery . at this time , it is necessary to consider the public health situation and the gradual reopening of our economy . that is why we feel our approach aims for a safe recovery . obviously , by gathering more information in phase3 , we will be able to consider more than one approach to recovery . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : mr.ste-marie , you have about 30seconds left . mr. gabriel ste-marie : thank you . i understand that the exact date for tabling the recovery plan may be difficult to determine at this time . can the minister tell us whether he currently intends to table the recovery plan in a month ending in ber ? if not , will it be before or after that ?"
