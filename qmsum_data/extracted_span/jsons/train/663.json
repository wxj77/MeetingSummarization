    "answer": "professor b : it well , it well , you 're right . sometimes somebody will be away and , uh , you know , there 's , uh for any length of time that you uh , choose there is some person sometime who will not end up reading it . that 's it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take . phd h : s so maybe when am i on , by the way ? grad f : i do n't know . you should be . phd h : oh . hello ? hello ? grad f : you should be channel b . phd h : oh , ok . alright . so . the , um maybe we should say in w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the the agreement that you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how how they will be contacted and they can , you know they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both . and , um , then postdoc a : we did that , i i believe . phd h : right . phd e : yeah . phd h : so . a and , then , you know , say very clearly that if they do n't if we do n't hear from them , you know , as morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain period after we contact them that is implicitly giving their agreement . grad f : well , they 've already signed a form . postdoc a : and the form says phd e : and nobody nobody really reads it anyway . phd h : right . grad f : so . and the s and the form was approved by human subjects , phd h : says that . right . postdoc a : uh , the f phd h : well , if that 's i tha if that 's already if grad f : so , eh , that 's gon na be a little hard to modify . postdoc a : well , the form well , the form does n't say , if uh , you know , `` if you do n't respond by x number of days or x number of weeks `` phd h : i see . uh oh , ok . so what does it say about the the the process of of , uh y the review process ? postdoc a : it does n't have a time limit . that you 'll be provided access to the transcripts and then , uh , allowed to remove things that you 'd like to remove , before it goes to the general uh , larger audience . phd h : oh , ok . hmm . right . grad f : here . postdoc a : there you go . grad f : you can read what you already signed . phd e : i guess when i read it , um i 'm not as diligent as chuck , but i had the feeling i should probably respond and tell adam , like , `` i got this and i will do it by this date , and if you do n't hear from me by then `` you know , in other words responding to your email once , right away , saying `` as soon as you get this could you please respond . `` grad f : right . phd e : and then if you if the person thinks they 'll need more time because they 're out of town or whatever , they can tell you at that point ? because grad f : oh , i just i did n't wan na do that , because i do n't wan na have a discussion with every person if i can avoid it . phd e : well , it 's grad f : so what i wanted to do was just send it out and say `` on the fifteenth , the data is released , postdoc a : mm - hmm . grad f : if you wan na do something about it , do something about it , but that 's it `` . postdoc a : i i kind of like this . phd e : well postdoc a : yeah . phd e : ok . so , we 're assuming that phd h : well , that 's that would be great if but you should probably have a legal person look at this and make sure it 's ok . because if you if you , uh , do this and you then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they did n't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually exercise their their right phd e : or they they might never have gotten the email , because although they signed this , they do n't know by which date to expect your email . and so someone whose machine is down or whatever i mean , we have no professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : in internally we know that people are there , grad f : well , ok . l let me let me reverse this . phd e : but we have no confirmation that they got the mail . grad f : so let 's say someone i send this out , and someone does n't respond . do we delete every meeting that they were in ? phd e : well , then grad f : i do n't think so . phd e : it we 're hoping that does n't happen , but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail grad f : that will happen . phd e : or phd h : that will happen . phd e : right . grad f : that will absolutely happen . because people do n't read their email , or they 'll read and say `` i do n't care about that , i 'm not gon na delete anything `` and they don just wo n't reply to it . phd h : maybe uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? grad f : no . we have what they put on the speaker form , postdoc a : well { comment } most grad f : which was just generic contact information . postdoc a : but the ones that we 're dealing with now are all local , phd h : well , then postdoc a : except the ones who i mean , we we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups . phd h : mmm . ok . postdoc a : so maybe , uh , i you know , that 's not that many people and if i if , uh i i there is an advantage to having them admit and if i can help with with processing that , i will . it 's it 's there is an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating grad f : yeah . i mean i thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago . postdoc a : yes , we did . grad f : and so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again . postdoc a : you 're right . well , i you know . but sometimes professor b : well , we we have n't experienced it before . postdoc a : that 's right . professor b : right ? so phd e : you 'll either wonder at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end . postdoc a : need to get it right . phd e : i mean , there 's no way to get around i it 's pretty much the same am amount of work except for an additional email just saying they got the email . postdoc a : yeah . phd e : and maybe it 's better legally to wonder before you know , a little bit earlier than grad f : well postdoc a : it 's much easier to explain this way . grad f : ok . well , why do n't you talk t postdoc a : t t to have it on record . grad f : morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it , and find out what the status is on this ? cuz i do n't wan na do something that we do n't need to . postdoc a : yeah , but w mmm . grad f : because what i 'm telling you , people wo n't respond to the email . no matter what you do , you there 're gon na be people who you 're gon na have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with . postdoc a : well , then we make the effort . grad d : i mean , i it 's k grad f : and do we want to spend that effort ? postdoc a : we make the effort . grad d : it 's kind of like signing up for a mailing list . they have opt in and opt out . and there are two different ways . i mean , and either way works probably , i mean . postdoc a : except i really think in this case i i 'm agr i agree with liz , that we need to be in the clear and not have to after the fact say `` oh , but i assumed `` , and `` oh , i 'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you `` , you know . professor b : if this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it . postdoc a : oh , excellent . professor b : but the thing is that , you know , i i i think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , from my previous conversations with them , my my sense very much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this . grad f : well , we had talked about this before professor b : mm - hmm . grad f : and i thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that and they said you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form that they 've already signed once . postdoc a : i do n't remember that this issue of the time period allowed for response was ever covered . grad f : yeah . professor b : yeah . we never really talked about that . phd e : or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you . postdoc a : or or how they would indicate professor b : yeah . phd e : they probably forgot all about it . professor b : we certainly did n't talk , uh , about with them at all about , uh , the manner of them being made the , uh , uh , materials available . phd e : yeah . phd h : we do it like with these professor b : that was something that was sort of just within our implementation . phd h : we can use it we can use a a ploy like they use to , um you know , that when they serve , like uh , uh , uh { comment } uh , you know , like dead - beat dads , they they they make it look like they won something in the lottery and then they open the envelope grad d : and they 're served . phd h : and that right ? because and then the the the the thing is served . so you just make it , you know , `` oh , you won you know , go to this web site and you 've , uh you 're `` phd e : that 's why you never open these things that come in the mail . postdoc a : that one . professor b : yeah . grad f : well , it 's just , we 've gone from one extreme to the other , where at one point , a few months ago , morgan was you were saying let 's not do anything , phd h : right . right . no , it i it might postdoc a : well , it does n't matter . phd h : i i it it might well be the case grad f : and now we 're we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ? phd h : it might right . grad f : i mean , what are we gon na doing here ? phd h : it might well be the case that that this is perfectly you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh , assume their consent if they do n't reply . professor b : well . grad f : mm - hmm . phd h : but , i 'm not you know , me not being a lawyer , i would n't just wan na do that without having the the expert , uh , opinion on that . postdoc a : and how many people ? al - altogether we 've got twenty people . these people are people who read their email almost all the time . grad f : then i think we had better find out , so that we can find a phd h : yeah . professor b : let me look at this again . grad f : right . postdoc a : i i really do n't see that it 's a problem . i i think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have @ @ { comment } us try to contact them , grad f : for for th postdoc a : u just in case they had n't gotten their email . i think they 'd appreciate it . professor b : yeah . my adam , my my view before was about the nature of what was of the presentation , grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : of of how my my the things that we 're questioning were along the lines of how easy uh , h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : that was the kind of dispute i was making before . postdoc a : mm - hmm . i remember that . professor b : but , um , the attorneys , i uh , i can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things , but they will always come back with saying that , um , you need to you want to have someth some paper trail or which includes electronic trail that they have , uh , in fact o k 'd it . grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um , i think that if you f i if we send the email as you have and if there 's half the people , say , who do n't respond at all by , you know , some period of time , we can just make a list of these people and hand it to , uh you know , just give it to me and i 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever , grad f : right . professor b : and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , `` have you is is this ok ? and would you please mail you know , mail adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . `` so , you know , we can we can do that . phd e : the other thing that there 's a psychological effect that at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying `` yes , i will do it `` or `` yes , i got your email `` , they 're more likely to actually do it { comment } later than to just ignore it . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : and of course we do n't want them to bleep things out , but it it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd { comment } at al at all . that 's how these mailing houses work . so , i mean , it 's not completely lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses . postdoc a : mm - hmm . phd e : you know , an official ok from somebody is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email . and they 're probably more likely to do that once they 've responded that they got the email . postdoc a : i also think they 'd just simply appreciate it . i think it 's a good a good way of of fostering goodwill among our subjects . well , our participants . professor b : i think the main thing is i mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases . grad f : sending lots of spam . professor b : so they s so so tha - that 's what they 're paid to do . and so , it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something and they would n't actually hear from us , and then they find this thing is in there and we 've already distributed it to someone . so , what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah , postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : but if in fact if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they did n't actually receive it for some reason , um , then we have n't given them that . grad f : well , so how far do we have to go ? do we need to get someone 's signature ? or , is email enough ? professor b : i i i em email is enough . grad f : do we have to have it notarized ? i mean ok . professor b : yeah . i mean , i 've been through this i mean , i 'm not a lawyer , but i 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so i i i i 'm pretty comfortable with that . phd c : do you track , um , when people log in to look at the ? grad f : uh . if they submit the form , i get it . phd c : uh - huh . grad f : if they do n't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . but that 's not sufficient . right ? cuz if someone just visits the web site that does n't imply anything in particular . phd c : except that you know they got the mail . postdoc a : mm - hmm . that 's right . grad f : right . postdoc a : i i could get you on the notify list if you want me to . grad f : i 'm already on it . postdoc a : for that directory ? ok , great . grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so again , hopefully , um , this should n't be quite as odious a problem either way , uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about because uh , we 're talking a pretty small number of people . grad f : w for this set , i 'm not worried , because we basically know everyone on it . professor b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad f : you know , they 're all more or less here or it 's it 's eric and dan and so on . but for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are gone from icsi , whose email addresses may or may not work , professor b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad f : and so what are we gon na do when we run into someone that we ca n't get in touch with ? postdoc a : i do n't think , uh they 're so recent , these visitors . grad f : mm - hmm . postdoc a : i and and i they 're also so professor b : mm - hmm . postdoc a : they 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through i i mean , i i w i 'll be able to if you have any trouble finding them , i really think i could find them . grad f : other methods ? ok . professor b : yeah . cuz it what it what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission . um , and i think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and and ask their permission and they 're not there , it does n't seem { comment } that that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here . so . grad f : well , the qu the question is just whether how active it has to be . i mean , because they they filled out a contact information and that 's where i 'm sending the information . professor b : right . grad f : and so far everyone has done email . there is n't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method . professor b : well , the way icsi goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc have forwards to other accounts and so on . grad f : yeah . professor b : so it 's unusual that that they , uh grad f : so my original impression was that that was sufficient , that if they give us contact information and that contact information is n't accurate that we fulfilled our burden . professor b : yeah . phd e : then they just come back . phd c : all my files were still here . phd e : same as us . postdoc a : i just professor b : so if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe i will call the attorney about it . phd c : yeah . professor b : but , you know , hopefully we wo n't need to . postdoc a : i d i just do n't think we will . for all the reasons that we 've discussed . grad f : alright . professor b : so we 'll we 'll see if we do or not . grad f : yep . and we 'll see how many people respond to that email . postdoc a : yeah . grad f : so far , two people have . professor b : yeah . i think very few people will and and and , you know , people people see long emails about things that they do n't think is gon na be high priority , they typically , uh , do n't do n't read it , or half read it . grad f : right . professor b : cuz people are swamped . postdoc a : and actually , professor b : but postdoc a : um , i i did n't anticipate this so i that 's why i did n't give this comment , and it i this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying `` by the way , you know , we wan na hear back from you by x date and please `` , and then add what liz said `` please , uh , respond to please indicate you received this mail . `` professor b : uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um , `` even if you 've decided you have no changes you 'd like to make , if you could tell us that `` . grad f : respond to the email . { comment } yep . postdoc a : mm - hmm . it is the first time through the cycle . professor b : yeah . phd e : right . that would that would definitely work on me . you know , it makes you feel m like , um , if you were gon na p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that . whereas , i i mean , i would be much more likely myself , phd c : and the other th phd e : given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying `` you know what , i 'm probably not gon na get to it `` or whatever , rather than just having seen the email , thinking i might get to it , and never really , uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late . phd c : yeah . i was i was thinking that it also lets them know that they do n't have to go to the page to accept this . phd e : right . r right . that 's true . professor b : right . phd c : i mean , i i yeah . so that way they could they can see from that email that if they just write back and say `` i got it , no changes `` , they 're off the hook . professor b : yeah . phd c : they do n't have to go to the web page professor b : i mean , the other thing i 've learned from dealing with dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , if you say `` you 've got three months to do this review `` , um , people do it , you know , two and seven eighths months from now . phd c : and phd e : yeah . that 's true . professor b : if you say `` you 've got three weeks to do this review `` , they do do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now they do the review . grad f : right . professor b : and , um so , if we make it a little less time , i do n't think it 'll be that much grad f : well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first , if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time . professor b : there 's the responding part and there 's also what if , uh , i mean , i hope this does n't happen , what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes ? grad f : right . professor b : then we actually have to deal with that postdoc a : mm - hmm . some lead time . professor b : if we want it to grad f : ugh ! disk space , postdoc a : by the way , has has jeremy signed the form ? grad f : oh my god ! i had n't thought about that . that for every meeting any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . phd c : just that channel . grad d : ca n't you just do that channel ? phd c : oh , no . we have to do grad f : no , of course not . phd e : yeah . you have to do all of them , grad f : you need all the channels . phd c : do you have to do the other close - talking ? phd e : as well as all of these . grad d : yeah . phd e : you have to do all you could just do it in that time period , though , grad f : yes . absolutely . there 's a lot of cross - talk . postdoc a : well phd e : but i guess it 's a pain . grad f : well , but you have to copy the whole file . phd e : yeah . grad f : right ? because we 're gon na be releasing the whole file . phd e : yeah . you 're right . postdoc a : well i you know , i think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy . grad f : yeah . it 's just i hate deleting any data . so i i do n't want i really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out professor b : are you del are you bleeping it by adding ? grad f : and then overlapping . so , it 's it 's exactly a censor bleep . so what i really think is `` bleep `` professor b : i i i i understand , but is is it summing signals grad f : and then i want to professor b : or do you delete the old one and put the new one in ? grad f : i delete the old one , put the new one in . professor b : oh , ok . cuz grad f : there 's nothing left of the original signal . professor b : oh . cuz if you were summing , you could no . but anyway grad f : yeah . it would be qui quite easy to get it back again . postdoc a : but and then w i was gon na say also that the they do n't have to stay on the system , as you know , professor b : yeah . phd e : then someday we can sell the unedited versions . postdoc a : cuz cuz the the ones grad f : say again ? postdoc a : once it 's been successfully bleeped , ca n't you rely on the ? phd c : or we 'll tell people the frequency of the beep professor b : encrypt it . phd c : and then they could subtract the beep out . grad d : you can hide it . yeah . postdoc a : ca n't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version ? phd h : oh , yeah . grad d : it would n't be that hard to hide it . phd e : right . exactly . i see . grad f : yeah , that 's true . yeah . yep , that 's true . phd e : see , this is good . i wanted to create some side conversations in these meetings . professor b : yeah . you could encrypt it , you know , with a with a two hundred bit thousand bit , uh grad d : you can use spread spectrum . phd c : uh - huh . grad d : hide it . phd e : so phd c : here we go . phd e : yeah . yeah . grad d : yeah , there you go . phd e : cuz we do n't have enough asides . phd h : i have an idea . you reverse the signal , grad d : there you go . phd h : so it it lets people say what they said backwards . grad f : backwards . grad d : then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages , grad f : but , ha you 've seen the this the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments . phd h : yeah . grad d : like . grad f : did you read that paper ? it would n't work . the speech recognizer still works . phd e : yeah . and if you do it backward then professor b : yeah . phd c : that 's cuz they use forward - backward . phd e : h - good old hmm . grad f : forward but backward . that 's right . phd e : no , it 's backward - forward . grad f : good point . a point . well , i 'm sorry if i sound a little peeved about this whole thing . it 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved . professor b : well , but we never also we 've also never done it . postdoc a : this is the first cycle . phd e : if it makes grad f : yeah . postdoc a : there 're bound to be some glitches the first time through . professor b : so . and , uh and i 'm sorry responding without , uh , having much knowledge , but the thing is , uh , i am , like , one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and and stuff comes in as grad f : well , and that 's exactly why i did it the way i did it , which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gon na release it . professor b : yeah . grad f : because , you know , i have my stack of emails of to d to be done , that , you know , fifty or sixty long , and the ones at the top i 'm never gon na get to ."
