    "answer": "project manager : i live um i live right across the street from an open space in california . we have coyotes howl all the time . so i really enjoy their their singing , you they 're really beautiful animals . mm . okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . we 're gon na talk about project finances . um we have a couple we 'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it 's a we have a market range of internet , like it 's an international market range , we do n't have to worry about specifics . um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro . so we 're selling it for twice what we 'd like to produce it for . okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , i could i 'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you do n't like , etcetera , so marketing : um i hate when there 's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the tv like you have to do one for the power of the tv and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , i do n't know . now they keep combining all different remotes together , and i do n't know if i necessarily like that 'cause i feel like you end up with multimedia overload . user interface : marketing : i just wan na watch the tv um . always gets lost . some sort of like device to help you find it . user interface : i 've used , i 've used remote controls , for things like tv and the c_d_ player and video recorder and i i guess they 're they 're pretty neat neat little tools uh . you do n't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . so especially if you 're someone really lazy like me they they 're pretty nice . um . i find them they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if i 'm watching tv i have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the tv , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . um . and also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they 've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all i really wan na do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume . industrial designer : yeah um . i agree with having too many remotes around . my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and i do n't know how to work half of them um . what 's important for me , i guess , is that it 's easy to use and that there 's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you 're doing . and one thing i particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red ."
