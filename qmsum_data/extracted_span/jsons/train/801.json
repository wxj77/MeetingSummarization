    "answer": "professor e : ok . alright . uh . barry , do you wan na say something about your stuff here ? grad a : oh , um . right . i just , um , continuing looking at , uh , ph uh , phonetic events , and , uh , this tuesday gon na be , uh , meeting with john ohala with chuck to talk some more about these , uh , ph um , phonetic events . um , came up with , uh , a plan of attack , uh , gon na execute , and um yeah . it 's that 's pretty much it . professor e : oh , well . no um , why do n't you say something about what it is ? grad a : oh , you oh , you want you want details . hmm . ok . professor e : well , we 're all gathered here together . i thought we 'd , you know grad a : i was hoping i could wave my hands . um . so , um . so , once wa i i was thinking getting getting us a set of acoustic events to um , to be able to distinguish between , uh , phones and words and stuff . and um , once we we would figure out a set of these events that can be , you know , um , hand - labeled or or derived , uh , from h the hand - labeled phone targets . um , we could take these events and , um , do some cheating experiments , um , where we feed , um , these events into an sri system , um , eh , and evaluate its performance on a switchboard task . uh , yeah . grad d : hey , barry ? can you give an example of an event ? grad a : yeah . sure . um , i i can give you an example of twenty - odd events . um so , he in this paper , um , it 's talking about phoneme recognition using acoustic events . so , things like frication or , uh , nasality . professor e : whose paper is it ? grad a : um , this is a paper by hubener and cardson benson bernds - berndsen . professor e : yeah . huh . from , uh , university of hamburg and bielefeld . grad a : mm - hmm . phd f : yeah . i think the just to expand a little bit on the idea of acoustic event . grad a : mm - hmm . phd f : there 's , um in my mind , anyways , there 's a difference between , um , acoustic features and acoustic events . and i think of acoustic features as being , um , things that linguists talk about , like , um professor e : so , stuff that 's not based on data . phd f : stuff that 's not based on data , necessarily . professor e : yeah . oh , ok . yeah . yeah , ok . phd f : right . that 's not based on , you know , acoustic data . so they talk about features for phones , like , uh , its height , grad a : yeah . phd f : its tenseness , laxness , things like that , grad a : mm - hmm . phd f : which may or may not be all that easy to measure in the acoustic signal . versus an acoustic event , which is just some something in the acoustic signal that is fairly easy to measure . um . so it 's , um it 's a little different , in at least in my mind . professor e : i mean , when we did the spam work i mean , there we had we had this notion of an , uh , auditory @ @ { comment } auditory event . grad a : good . that 's great . professor e : and , uh , um , called them `` avents `` , uh , uh , uh , with an a at the front . phd f : mm - hmm . professor e : uh . and the the the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere . so . grad a : mm - hmm . professor e : um . a sudden change or a relatively rapid change in some spectral characteristic will will do sort of this . i mean , there 's certainly a bunch of a bunch of places where you know that neurons are gon na fire because something novel has happened . that was that was the main thing that we were focusing on there . but there 's certainly other things beyond what we talked about there that are n't just sort of rapid changes , but phd f : it 's kinda like the difference between top - down and bottom - up . professor e : yeah . phd f : i think of the acoustic you know , phonetic features as being top - down . you know , you look at the phone and you say this phone is supposed to be you know , have this feature , this feature , and this feature . whether tha those features show up in the acoustic signal is sort of irrelevant . whereas , an acoustic event goes the other way . here 's the signal . here 's some event . grad a : mm - hmm . phd f : what ? and then that you know , that may map to this phone sometimes , and sometimes it may not . it just depen maybe depends on the context , things like that . professor e : mm - hmm . phd f : and so it 's sort of a different way of looking . professor e : mm - hmm . grad a : yeah . so . yeah . mm - hmm . um using these these events , um , you know , we can we can perform these these , uh , cheating experiments . see how how how good they are , um , in , um in terms of phoneme recognition or word recognition . and , um and then from that point on , i would , uh , s design robust event detectors , um , in a similar , um , wa spirit that saul has done w uh , with his graphical models , and this this probabilistic and - or model that he uses . um , eh , try to extend it to , um to account for other other phenomena like , um , cmr co - modulation release . and , um and maybe also investigate ways to to modify the structure of these models , um , in a data - driven way , uh , similar to the way that , uh , jeff jeff , uh , bilmes did his work . um , and while i 'm i 'm doing these , um , event detectors , you know , i can ma mea measure my progress by comparing , um , the error rates in clean and noisy conditions to something like , uh , neural nets . um , and so so , once we have these these , uh , event detectors , um , we could put them together and and feed the outputs of the event detectors into into the sri , um , hmm hmm system , and , um and test it on on switchboard or , um , maybe even aurora stuff . and , that 's pretty much the the big picture of of um , the plan . professor e : by the way , um , there 's , uh , a couple people who are gon na be here i forget if i already told you this , but , a couple people who are gon na be here for six months . grad a : mm - hmm . professor e : uh uh , there 's a professor kollmeier , uh , from germany who 's , uh , uh , quite big in the , uh , hearing - aid signal - processing area and , um , michael kleinschmidt , who 's worked with him , who also looks at auditory properties inspired by various , uh , brain function things . so , um , um , i think they 'll be interesting to talk to , in this sort of issue as these detectors are are , uh , developing . grad a : hmm . ok . professor e : so , he looks at interesting interesting things in in the different ways of looking at spectra in order to to get various speech properties out . so . ok . well , short meeting , but that 's ok . and , uh , we might as well do our digits . and like i say , i i encourage you to go ahead and meet , uh , next week with , uh , uh , hynek . alright , i 'll i 'll start . it 's , uh , one thirty - five . seventeen ok"
