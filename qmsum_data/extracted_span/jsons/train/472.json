    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about generating queries",
    "answer": "phd f : the question i had about queries was , um , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? are are we gon na try and o grad g : we we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? phd f : yeah . well , i mean , grad g : and so that was one suggestion . phd f : so , the question i had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ? i mean , i think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , so that it may not be a feasible thing . but phd e : hello . dan here . phd b : should n't landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? professor d : yeah . phd b : i mean , this is an issue that goes a little bit beyond where we are right now . they 're the expert phd e : mari ? professor a : yeah ? phd e : someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . is someone picking you up ? professor a : um , what 's our schedule ? professor d : well , you still wanted to talk with liz . professor a : let 's see , you and i need dis uh , no , we did the liz talk . professor d : and you and i need to oh , oh . you already did the liz talk . professor a : yeah . so so that was the prosody thing . phd b : we - i do n't remember it . professor a : um , we need to finish the professor d : oh , ok . professor a : it 's already four - fifteen . phd b : i have like no recall memory . professor a : uh , after . professor d : yeah . professor a : we need to finish this discussion , and you and i need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . so , grad g : and what ? professor a : um professor d : i 'm at your disposal . so , up to you . professor a : um , what what 's the plan for this discussion ? we should professor d : um , i think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? grad g : at least . yeah . professor a : uh , less . grad g : m i even if that much ? professor a : yeah . professor d : less ? grad g : less . professor a : so , i think phd b : it 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free professor d : well , i mean , we still have n't talked about the action items from here and so on . professor a : action yeah . so , phd b : yet it 's separate . professor d : and professor a : e e why do n't you say five - thirty ? i do n't phd e : ok , five - thirty . professor a : is that ok ? we 'll probably hit horrible traffic . phd e : sounds ok . h thanks , bye . professor a : that 's not a lot of time , phd e : that 's that . professor a : but professor d : yeah . grad g : well , in answer to `` is it landay 's problem ? `` , um , he does n't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . so he has very little manpower . um , there 's very little allocated for him and also he 's pretty focused on user interface . so i do n't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . professor d : yeah , well there 's gon na be these student projects that can do some things but it ca n't be , yeah , very deep . u i i actually think that that , uh , again , just as a bootstrap , { comment } if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , uh , could at least give give landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know . i mean , ye right ? if he does n't know anything about the area , and the people are talking about and and , uh phd b : but the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . that 's what i 'm worried about . so you might as well just give him the summaries . professor d : mm - hmm . phd b : and professor d : maybe . phd f : well , i 'm not sure i 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . grad g : y well , but i think phd b : oh , ok . phd f : right ? of how to how to generate queries from a phd b : how to do this from the summary . professor d : yeah . grad g : i , uh phd f : that was sort of what my question was aimed towards . phd b : so what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , uh , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gon na be at the same time as the meeting . there 's no way that can happen . are we gon na later go over it professor d : right . grad g : right . phd b : and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or or a deeper yeah . i mean grad g : or or just a memory refresher . phd b : but that 's done off they have to do that off - line . grad g : yep . i agree . postdoc h : i 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be `` what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? `` becau - in terms of like informativeness , phd b : that 's a good one . postdoc h : it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . professor d : i would think that would be the most likely thing . phd b : dan does n't know what sex he is . phd e : yeah , really . professor a : but actually i would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . postdoc h : i think you get two different types of information . professor a : you get two yeah , that 's true . phd e : yeah . postdoc h : because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . professor d : yeah . grad g : we 're still here . postdoc h : so you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary . but with the `` what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? `` uh , so the fact that , uh , i know that transcriber uses snack is something that i thought was interesting phd b : going to see the kids . phd e : you you can keep it on . postdoc h : and that and that dan worked on on that . so i thought that was really you know . so , i mean , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that would n't even occur as major headings professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc h : but could be very informative . professor a : yeah , that 's actually a really good idea . postdoc h : i think it would n't be too , uh , uh , cost - intensive either . you know , i mean , it 's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment . professor c : are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? grad g : as many are willing to do it . professor c : make it a voluntary thing , phd e : yeah . cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? professor c : and then yeah . that 's why i was wondering . phd e : so grad g : well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done i mean , i we did n't take minutes and we do n't have summaries . but , uh , people could , like , listen to them a little bit and generate some queries . postdoc h : yeah . grad g : of course jane does n't need to . i 'm sure you have that meeting memorized by now . phd e : yeah . professor a : but actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , postdoc h : yeah . yeah . professor a : for those pe people willing to stay . postdoc h : and that i think it would pick up the micro - structure , the some some of the little things that would be hidden . professor a : and and that might be something people are willing to stay for . professor d : boy , i i do n't know how we get at this postdoc h : that would be interesting . professor c : yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something grad g : or want to get up and leave . professor c : and then you go around the room and they say `` yeah , me too , i agree . `` grad g : me too , me too , me too . professor d : yeah . professor a : that 's fine . professor c : so phd e : on the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? professor d : well phd e : they might say `` oh , i was gon na say that one but now i have to think of something else `` . grad g : well , you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it . we 'll i mean , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people did n't say . professor d : it 's gon na take some thought . i mean , it seemed the kind of , uh , interest that i had in this thing initially was , uh , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later , professor a : mm - hmm . professor d : and you want to pick up something from this meeting related to the something else . so it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else professor a : right . professor d : rather than the and it might be something minor of minor importance to the meeting . professor c : mm - hmm . grad g : right . professor d : uh , in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . so it 's it 's that you 're trying to find { comment } you 're you 've now you were n't interested say i i said `` well , i was n't that much interested in dialogue , i 'm more of an acoustics person `` . phd e : right . professor d : but but thr three months from now if for some reason i get really interested in dialogue , and i 'm `` well what is what was that part that that that , uh , mari was saying ? `` grad g : yeah , like jim bass says `` add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf `` professor a : uh professor d : yeah . yeah . professor a : yeah . professor d : and then i 'm trying to fi i mean , that 's that 's when i look in general when i look things up most , is when it 's something that did n't really stick in my head the first time around and but for some { comment } new reason i 'm i 'm i 'm interested in in in the old stuff . grad g : but that that 's gon na be very hard to generate . professor a : well , i that 's hard to generate professor d : so , i do n't i do n't know . professor c : mm - hmm . phd f : do we professor a : and and i think that 's half of what i i would use it for . but i also a lot of times um , make you know , think to myself `` this is interesting , professor d : mm - hmm . professor a : i 've got ta come back and follow up on it `` . professor d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor a : so , things that i think are interesting , um , i would be , uh , wanting to do a query about . and also , i like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , i 'd kind of want to know about it and then i 'd want to follow up on it . professor d : yeah . that that might get at some of what i was i was concerned about , uh , being interested in something later that w uh , i did n't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if i thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if i did n't , but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up . grad g : but but what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . professor d : yeah . so having multiple people might get at some of that . grad g : by so by going around yeah . professor d : yeah . grad g : yeah , i i think you ca n't get at all of it , professor d : yeah ."
