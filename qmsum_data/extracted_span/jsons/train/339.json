    "answer": "project manager : okay um , welcome to our detailed design meeting . i 'm pretty excited . let 's start it 's approximately fifteen forty or something like that . okay um the agenda we 're gon na do an opening and then um i 'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we 'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . we 'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close . so , starting off with the um last the last one , oh i do n't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we 're gon na use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we 're not gon na need a a shuffle um , we 're gon na need a scroll um , we 're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that 's curved and um we 're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . and it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . okay ? let 's do the look and feel design presentation first . user interface : right , do you wan na start ? industrial designer : right , well we made three different prototypes and i guess we 'll start with with this one . um we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . um it 's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it 's easily adaptable to either hand . you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even i mean there 's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . we have our up and down buttons , which are also gon na be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . if you push if you 're just pushing these normally , they 're the menu buttons , if uh the volume buttons rather . if you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . if we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your tv channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here . um if people wan na grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand . that 's our number one prototype . um do you wan na present the potato , project manager : like a little lightning in it . industrial designer : or shall i present the martian ? user interface : okay , project manager : the little lightning bolt in it , very cute . user interface : um what we call that one the rhombus , marketing : i could project manager : the v the rhombus rhombus ? user interface : uh the rhombus . industrial designer : that 's the rhombus , yep . user interface : um this one is known as the potato , uh it 's industrial designer : user interface : it 's a marketing : user interface : how can i present it ? it 's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . um it 's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand . um i 've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . so you 've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that 's um moves between your favourite channels that you 've selected . uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you 're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select and that 's basically it , that 's the potato . project manager : um on , off ? user interface : uh that would be one of your channels , basically , project manager : okay . user interface : so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off , project manager : yeah we turn it off . user interface : yeah . marketing : could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? user interface : um not really , it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your tv off . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : if you pressed and held it maybe . user interface : yeah yeah , that that 'd be one way of doing it , yeah . that 'd work , yeah . marketing : if you like held it down , that would be on off . industrial designer : yeah . on off , that 's a possibility , yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and then finally we have um the martian or the pear , either way . um it 's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . we have the five preset seeds . project manager : industrial designer : and then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . so , that 's for your consideration as well , plus it 's an interesting talking point to have standing up . user interface : let 's pass . industrial designer : we figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if i made the bot the bottom flat . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : sorry , what 's the yellow one in the middle , industrial designer : uh the menu select button . marketing : i forgot . project manager : very interesting . i think that one 's my favourite . industrial designer : user interface : so that 's so that 's our three prototypes . um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we 'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wan na put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever . marketing : project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : we were we were thinking that normally we 'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we 're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we 'd have one version that 's a bit toned down , project manager : mm 'kay . industrial designer : maybe with with less contrasts on it . yeah , something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but user interface : would yeah , but we do n't want it to look like a kids ' toy . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : now that was one thing that we brought up over email . i do n't know if you picked up your email , but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : right . well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it 's not just like another piece of technology around your house . it 's gon na be somewhere that it can be seen . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so we 're we 're not thinking that it 's gon na be as critical to have the loss marketing : but if it 's like under covers or like in a couch you still ca n't see it . project manager : it 's really would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like i dunno , you tape to your to your tv um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ? do you think that would be conceptually possible ? industrial designer : i think user interface : i think it would be difficult technologically , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : because if your if your remote 's lost it 's probably under the settee and in that case you ca n't you ca n't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , s so it 's i 'm not quite sure how it would work project manager : that 's true , mm 'kay . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and then i wonder if it 's if it 's more just a gimmick then anything else . uh i mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ? industrial designer : there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . project manager : mm-hmm . okay , that 's a fair evaluation . getting lost . um we so we do we 've decided not to worry about that for now . okay 'cause well , the designs are very bright , so you 're right , they 're gon na stick out , but um industrial designer : so d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? um . marketing : i feel like this is simil or it 's sort of what already exists so if we 're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you 're init i 'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it 's like comfortable and like not different . i sort of like this one , like i i do n't know why , it just it 's like small but still sort of like cute looking , i dunno . but i also like the b the side buttons on that one , like i think that 's kind of neat . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but i dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on . project manager : could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? so then w we would n't have to have like a dual function ? industrial designer : mm yeah , user interface : yeah , it 's possible , yeah , yeah . industrial designer : that 's good , that 's good . marketing : there we go . industrial designer : here , stick it on . user interface : put an extra the button on . marketing : project manager : sure . industrial designer : project manager : um uh why do n't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you 've developed some ? marketing : well do we w like i think we 're supposed to have one that we do it for . project manager : oh okay . okay . marketing : that was industrial designer : so where marketing : i was a little vague on what exactly i 'm supposed to do , but let me i have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . project manager : okay . do you need this industrial designer : project manager : or just write on the white board ? marketing : no , i actually do n't have like a powerpointy thing , project manager : okay . industrial designer : right . marketing : 'cause i think it would be redundant . industrial designer : okay . marketing : i dunno . project manager : it 's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , industrial designer : ooh . project manager : you know , user interface : cool . project manager : kinda push it . industrial designer : hey . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : project manager : maybe a little smaller than that . industrial designer : no , i kinda like it . user interface : industrial designer : that 's hard to miss . user interface : it makes look more fruity as well . project manager : oh it does , industrial designer : project manager : it 's kind of like industrial designer : user interface : it 's like a deformed foot , i dunno . project manager : there it could have a stem like that , 'cause i do l kind of like the stem . industrial designer : like user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : yeah . it almost helps you ge keep a grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : interesting . project manager : i like this one . industrial designer : okay , project manager : variety of colours are nice . industrial designer : is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? i like the idea of the project manager : i think i 'm leaning towards the potato . industrial designer : i mean that 's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . project manager : mm-hmm . i am worried about like um using a menu . um in that like i withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : well that on the ipod , for example , you just every time you wan na go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level . project manager : but that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one 's both the menu and the select button ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : good point . user interface : this is , it 's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . project manager : okay . user interface : you find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh . project manager : could these be used for going to submenus user interface : yeah . yeah , so they 're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah . project manager : or industrial designer : maybe yeah , project manager : okay . industrial designer : maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something . project manager : mm-hmm . okay . well , as long as we have that in mind as we 're designing it still , mm 'kay . marketing : okay , so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities , the yellowy one is that industrial designer : the potato ? are we leaning towards the potato ? user interface : potato . project manager : i think so . marketing : okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one . industrial designer : okay . marketing : so basically what we need to do is some of the things that we 've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . industrial designer : okay . marketing : so what we sort of wan na do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then i 'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . industrial designer : okay . marketing : so we 'll just go through them one at a time and we 'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we 've created conforms to the following criteria . so we can do this one first . first we wan na know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . so like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i 'm gon na say it 's like a three . that 's just my opinion . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : what does each of you project manager : i i kind of think it 's it 's unique enough that i 'd give it a one or a two . marketing : okay , well give it a number , project manager : okay . marketing : sorry . project manager : i will give it a one . industrial designer : um i dunno if it 's it 's creative . i dunno if fancy is the word i would use . i dunno if any of them are fancy in i 'd say two , because c unique . marketing : okay . user interface : i 'll go for two . marketing : and two , awesome . alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? i think it 's extremely functional , i 'm gon na give it a one . industrial designer : yeah , one . user interface : i think it 's it 's functional , it 's also pretty basic , so i 'll give it a two . marketing : okay . project manager : um functional . i think it 'll get everything done , i think it might be a little confusing at first , um , i do n't know if that 's gon na be a later one . marketing : okay . well there 's some other ones , i will address that , project manager : okay , then i 'm gon na give it a two . marketing : yeah . awesome , okay . um we wan na know next if it 's technologically innovative . project manager : did you give a functional ? marketing : yeah , she said it was one . project manager : okay . marketing : um is it technologically innovative ? mm . not really , i mean not so much , 'cause we we do n't have the lcd screen , we do n't have fancy chip . other than what it looks like , i dunno if it 's really project manager : well , the kinetic battery . industrial designer : in the battery , that 's it . marketing : i kinetic battery is a big one , so . industrial designer : how many people would notice that , though ? marketing : mm . but it project manager : but they 'll notice it after like a year , marketing : but we know it 's there . project manager : they 'll be like hey , i have never changed the battery . marketing : and if it 's made of like latex , that whole idea , that 's pretty cool . project manager : mm . just the material . marketing : i 'll give it a three . 'cause it we could 've picked a lot of features that would 've made it really industrial designer : yeah . i i would say that it 's yeah , like fancy versus creative it 's it 's different . but does that equal innovative ? i dunno . i 'll give it a three . marketing : alright . everyone else ? user interface : i 'd say it 's technologically it 's not it 's not unique , i mean it 's it 's just it is just pushbuttons um , so i i 'd give it a four . project manager : think i 'm gon na go with the four as well . marketing : mm 'kay . project manager : i really like that kinetic battery though . marketing : next , is it easy to use ? just so you know , easy to learn will be separate , project manager : mm 'kay . marketing : so do n't overlap them . industrial designer : okay . marketing : i think it 's really easy to use . i 'll give it a two . industrial designer : um i 'll give it a one . pretty hard to mess up . user interface : i 'll say one . project manager : uh let 's say two . marketing : alright . um we next wan na see if it has a spongy quality industrial designer : user interface : marketing : and if indeed it 's made of latex or rubber i it 's spongy all the way . industrial designer : project manager : give it a one . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : i wonder if it bounces when you drop it . industrial designer : ooh , that you could n't marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : industrial designer : it 'd be harder to break , harder to lose . user interface : yeah . project manager : 'cause there would be less impact maybe , . marketing : iain , what do you give it ? user interface : i 'd i 'd give it a one . marketing : alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? industrial designer : user interface : uh um . marketing : well , is it gon na be yellow ? industrial designer : it it might be , 'cause that 's our corporate colour , is n't it ? project manager : that 's right , yeah , corporate colour , we did n't keep that in user interface : yeah . project manager : um well industrial designer : we might wan na keep it yellow . project manager : if we i know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that 'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that 's more fruity . marketing : yeah , but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , project manager : um and can we have like an r_r_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? industrial designer : if we had a yellow sure . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : oh , yeah . project manager : fruity , so fruity . industrial designer : so marketing : alright , so i think it it 's industrial designer : it was inspired by the potato , so i think it 's pretty fruity . marketing : yeah . project manager : i think i it 's kind of mangoey too . marketing : industrial designer : oh , mango user interface : mangoey is better , yeah . marketing : yeah . i industrial designer : that that user interface : i like mangoes . marketing : okay , i 'm giving it a one the mango put me over . industrial designer : that 's a much more trendy than a potato marketing : what are what 's everyone 's numbers ? user interface : uh two . industrial designer : marketing : alright um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? remember earlier we discussed that people do n't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . i think we really took that into account a lot , so i 'm gon na give it a one . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , me too . user interface : uh one . marketing : did you say one , rose ? okay um , also we talked earlier about r_s_i_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like carpal tunnely kind of thing . do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? i think i 'll give it a two , 'cause i almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gon na happen . project manager : it 's gon na be hard . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , yeah . project manager : and if it 's repetitive movement it is gon na be only four buttons that you 're constantly pushing , but um marketing : um um worth the risk , i think . project manager : i like how it fits in the hand though so i i 'd go with a two . industrial designer : yeah . i 'll i 'll say two as well . because older people that are n't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , marketing : 'kay . industrial designer : but user interface : yeah i 'll i 'll say two . marketing : alright , awesome . and the ease of learning it . i know you were saying that you 're a little bit nervous about that , i dunno . it sort of reminds me of the ipod . i just got mine , i still have n't read the instruction book and i 'm doing okay , so and i 'm not good at learning technology . so i 'll give it a two . industrial designer : the menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but i think if it 's one it 's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you 'll have it afterwards . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so i 'd i think i 'd give it a two i guess . user interface : i think it it 's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are industrial designer : oh , good point . user interface : and that could take a bit of learning at first , but marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : once you 've , yeah once you 'd learned how to use it , i think it is a lot easier . so i 'd i 'd give it a four . marketing : okay . project manager : i think i 'd give it a four too . it 's a pretty high learning curve , it 'll be easy once you 've done it , but industrial designer : user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . alright , um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we 're not addressing that at all , so project manager : we we industrial designer : project manager : i think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , but marketing : okay , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? i 'm gon na i 'm gon na give it a four , 'cause i think that you can still if it 's in between somewhere where you ca n't see it , you 're kind of not gon na find it , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but anywhere else it 's gon na stand out . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um i 'd say i 'd give it uh a three , i guess it depends on how tidy you are normally . project manager : mm i 'd give it a four . user interface : um i 'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah . project manager : small too . marketing : alright , we also said simplicity , how w how well does it address just being simple ? industrial designer : simple to use or simple in design ? do you know ? marketing : i think overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , industrial designer : marketing : so those are the next two things we 're gon na look at . separate from fancy , like that sort of thing . industrial designer : right . marketing : um it like wants to be simple but it 's not like totally totally simple , so i 'm gon na give it a two . industrial designer : i 'm give it a three i guess . user interface : i 'll give it a two . project manager : three . marketing : alright , and fashionable ? project manager : it 's totally fashionable . i 'd give it a one . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : it 's hot , i mean it 's a mango , come on . project manager : mango . marketing : i mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? i think it 's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . industrial designer : i dunno . user interface : industrial designer : i do n't think it 's quite as fashionable as my robot remote project manager : i do like uh the little martian one . industrial designer : or alien or whatever he was . marketing : yeah , the toggle on off switch , it 's really appealing . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : number . industrial designer : um two . user interface : three . marketing : and does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? just that it would se serve our audience . i do n't see why not . project manager : mm-hmm . i think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements . um yeah , that 's good . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so i 'll give it a a two . industrial designer : yeah , i 'll say two . marketing : alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we did n't talk about ? project manager : well um we did n't we did n't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let 's let 's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r_r_ on it . industrial designer : shall we uh well i think all of them should have an r_r_ . project manager : all of them should have r_r_ , yeah . marketing : and so we 're gon na do that , so it will address it , project manager : mm-hmm . mm 'kay . marketing : fine . okay . project manager : lovely . marketing : that 's me . project manager : okay , now we 're gon na look at finances . um i have an excel sheet that we 're actually gon na calculate the cost um , so let me exit out of this first . okay um industrial designer : oh my . marketing : whoa . project manager : i know . let me one more space . gon na zoom in real quick . okay . hand dynamo . we 're using kinetic battery , industrial designer : uh we 're n using kinetic , yeah . project manager : right ? um and we 're having one per one , okay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um electronics . industrial designer : single . project manager : simple . industrial designer : simple , simple rather . marketing : simple . project manager : mm 'kay . um the case . industrial designer : uh uh uh double-curved . user interface : guess it 's double-curved . it is pretty curvy . project manager : it 's very curvy , marketing : yeah . project manager : so okay . industrial designer : yeah i never did get a picture of those so i do n't really know . our case material supplements oops , we just skipped by them . marketing : well do n't we need plastic , and industrial designer : no , we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . the supplement is marketing : provided , okay . project manager : the wood ? industrial designer : oh , i guess it was rubber rather than latex . project manager : i mean the rubber . marketing : it was rubber and special colour , right ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm , okay . marketing : do we have more than one special colour ? project manager : yeah , we 're using we 're gon na need at least two special colours . industrial designer : uh well user interface : special colours , is n't it ? industrial designer : i do n't know what the se the basic colour is though . marketing : per project manager : i dunno where it yeah . marketing : well , but we know that we 're having at least three colours , project manager : so let 's y say three . marketing : so industrial designer : well , are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , you know , we 'll like we 'll have yellow and black . is that two special colours ? project manager : yeah , i dunno . that i thi industrial designer : or or is white and black , then two more or project manager : i thought that would be under yours . industrial designer : uh . i guess it 's three , project manager : we 'll just say three . industrial designer : three three . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : right . project manager : maybe the r_r_ will be in colour as well , industrial designer : alright . project manager : so yeah . interface , we 're doing push buttons . and how many buttons do we have ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : we have six . user interface : we 've got five . industrial designer : six , with the power . user interface : oh marketing : no , five . project manager : anything else ? industrial designer : yeah . no . oh , we 'll do we wa are the buttons in special colour , special f i did n't get information on marketing : oh wait . project manager : buttons oh , so um . so the case material will just have one colour , right , industrial designer : well , project manager : but then the buttons will be in special colours ? industrial designer : does it marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but if we 're making multiple varieties of this is where i 'm getting confused . project manager : we 're saying per unit . industrial designer : per unit , okay , okay . marketing : yeah , per unit . project manager : okay , so each unit will only have one colour on their industrial designer : alright , and each button s project manager : but the case is could have up to thr i mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it 's designed there . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : i like it like that . project manager : so industrial designer : yeah , okay . project manager : special form ? they 're all kind of just push button , right ? industrial designer : i think they 're fine . user interface : yeah . project manager : special material ? industrial designer : material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah . project manager : uh . oh do i have to do it per button , do i ? industrial designer : no , i do n't think so . i think they 're project manager : okay . industrial designer : if they 're all gon na be rubber then it that 's what it matters . marketing : yeah , 'cause it would n't make sense otherwise , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : 'cause for the whole mat case material it 's only one . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it 's i mean it 's two to make it rubber . industrial designer : okay . marketing : oh wait , so maybe . project manager : thirteen point seven . industrial designer : oh oh . project manager : yeah , what can we reduce ? industrial designer : okay , let 's have our buttons all be one colour . marketing : mm , i kind of like the buttons . project manager : let 's see what that would do . it 's only gon na bring us down to thirteen point three anyway . industrial designer : alright . project manager : okay um , are we sure this is double-curved ? maybe it 's single-curved , industrial designer : we have no idea . project manager : we have no idea . industrial designer : i dunno , i did n't get any pictures . it 's single curved . marketing : it 's single curved . industrial designer : why not ? project manager : well it 's not the yeah . okay , it 's the kinetic battery that 's kind of expensive , but we have a simple chip , single curve , marketing : project manager : case material is rubber and it 's a special colour , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : but that 's important . six buttons we have to have six buttons . industrial designer : that is important . how did it get more expensive , what did you just change ? project manager : what ? industrial designer : it was it was thirteen and now it 's fifteen . project manager : no , okay , maybe not . i do n't know what just happened . now it 's twelve . industrial designer : user interface : what was our target price again ? project manager : twelve point five . industrial designer : twelve point five . hey hey . user interface : twelve point five . so we 're just just about there . project manager : so we 're okay , i think . industrial designer : we 're all set then . project manager : yeah . okay , we 're all set . industrial designer : alright . project manager : um save . i saved that to our um our big shared folder , so you know . um okay , back to agenda . um are the are the costs under twelve fifty euro ? yes . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , they are . project manager : let 's move on to the project evaluation . project process . satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . so i guess what we 're gon na talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , um how how well i guess i led it , um the how well we worked together as a team , um the digital pens , the whiteboard . marketing : project manager : okay . industrial designer : well . i felt very creative . user interface : i think we 've been successful industrial designer : i enjoyed making the prototypes . user interface : in that we 've achieved almost all of the design goals that we 've set industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and we 've come up with a finished project and we just about got cost . industrial designer : i think we could 've done even better with a little bit more information , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : like what 's a single-curved case , how many colours , what do colours count project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : things , but given given what we had i think that we did we did really well . um i think we worked together pretty well . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , i mean if i 'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could 've taken that into account . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : industrial designer : but the fruits and vegetables , they really my creativity , so . project manager : marketing : i know , i really did , the the whole mango idea was great . industrial designer : do you think we could user interface : marketing : no , i mean i thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , i dunno . that was a bit of a distraction . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that was the last one , like i chose not to do a powerpoint 'cause i did n't think it made sense to , so i liked that i had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing . project manager : mm-hmm . i think we all made um very significant contributions , user interface : yeah . marketing : project manager : i do n't think anybody dominated it , which i thought was really good , like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and i uh i tried to facilitate it without like taking over , um industrial designer : yeah . project manager : i like our little finished products . industrial designer : can we market this as the mango remote ? marketing : they 're funny . project manager : really cute . user interface : marketing : i kind of want one . user interface : industrial designer : should we have that somewhere on the packaging ? i have a little r_r_ . marketing : i 'm trying to think of a good pun that i could add there . project manager : i know , industrial designer : project manager : let 's think of it like a little jingle . marketing : industrial designer : marketing : i like the r_r_ , that 's gon na be etched in . industrial designer : yes . hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it 's quite a useful little gadget . all thanks to iain for the design of that one . project manager : . okay um industrial designer : mm . what did we find for new ideas ? project manager : new ideas found ? industrial designer : people should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . project manager : definitely . or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm user interface : yeah . project manager : etcetera . industrial designer : i i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . project manager : oh , i 'm so excited . user interface : industrial designer : that was marketing : yeah , i did n't even know they existed . industrial designer : i i knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery , 'cause you 're always moving your wrist . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but in other things , i think it 'd be really good . project manager : i thi yeah , that 's awesome . um okay , closing . are the costs within the budget ? is the project evaluated ? now there 's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . um so , this is the great product kids , i think we 've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three industrial designer : yeah . project manager : which we hope um yeah . make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results and . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , real reaction . project manager : i do like the martian remote . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : if we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice . marketing : oh , that would definitely be my second choice . project manager : although the tog toggle industrial designer : marketing : project manager : i 'm afraid i would user interface : that 's cool . let 's all let 's all go for the yellow marketing : i would break it . i would break it . project manager : it 's cool . i think i would break it . industrial designer : it started because i wanted to have it as st as a stem user interface : break the stem off . industrial designer : and then alright , so marketing : oh that 's funny . industrial designer : is it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a martian project manager : oh industrial designer : when i put the user interface : marketing : kind of looks like a penguin , like with no eye . industrial designer : take me to your leader . project manager : yeah , it 's kind of a penguin . marketing : i like that it stands up . project manager : mm-mm . industrial designer : wow , maybe i should market it to some remote control company now . user interface : industrial designer : so are are project manager : user interface : that was bound to happen. $ marketing : oh , sad . industrial designer : poor little thing . project manager : mm 'kay , congratulations . um . anything else to say ? marketing : nothing will come up until after our meeting 's supposed to be over , project manager : alright . marketing : its all timed . project manager : um anybody have marketing : oh . project manager : i got more master classes , anybody else wan na like take a master 's class ? industrial designer : it 's really funny that you got spam in your work emails . marketing : user interface : project manager : yeah , but check it out . so like there are all these like links , they do n't go anywhere . industrial designer : project manager : but all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management . um just wan na make sure you do . marketing : industrial designer : user interface : marketing : industrial designer : marketing : no the first one that you sent like i did n't realise that it was a joke and i was like why did she send this to us ? project manager : oh industrial designer : marketing : it 's very it 's very work relevant , project manager : it is . marketing : 'cause people send spam a lot . project manager : yes definitely industrial designer : let 's see , project manager : i 'm very sad that i did n't get any links to the corporate website . . marketing : oh here you can you can view . industrial designer : what did i get through the corporate website ? it 's just inspiration about circuit boards . marketing : you can just see what 's up . yeah it 's it 's really deep . hold on . takes a little while to get excited to load . that the excel thing is pretty cool . industrial designer : yeah , that is pretty neat . project manager : i love excel , marketing : here , like , basically project manager : it 's one of my favourite programs . marketing : it 's like inspiration , basically i 'm gon na give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing , see . you did n't miss out that much . project manager : i see , mm . industrial designer : yeah , my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . project manager : spongy . industrial designer : i learned a lot actually . i could probably take apart a remote control now if i really needed to . marketing : oh wow . this one was cooler . i got a whole table and everything . industrial designer : now i have all about circuits and chips and transponders and i wrote it all down , because i thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they 're like , you do n't actually need this you just need to talk about the case . marketing : that 's like mine it was like , would you prefer an lcd screen or a multifunction remote control ? and then it did n't have like any kind of table , like awesome , i 'm glad they asked that question and did n't report the result . project manager : i i thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing . industrial designer : it 's really interesting though . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : we had a lot of the um otherwise the technology today was kinda cool . user interface : i think . yeah . industrial designer : that was really neat how i got emails project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and user interface : we did n't we did n't use the whiteboard that much . project manager : although i do n't see how we could have very l at least for me user interface : industrial designer : i yeah . if i 'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , i would have probably drawn them up , but marketing : 'cause we were n't like voting on anything and i think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period . industrial designer : yeah , we could 've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but with only four people it does n't really make sense . marketing : but i thought we were good orally . project manager : and with and with the powerpoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on powerpoint industrial designer : i think if you had a larger group marketing : get crazy . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : as that 's not as necessary to have . user interface : yeah . marketing : and these might 've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here , 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : because we 're all gon na be working in different places . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we if we were all gon na stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would 've been alright , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , i guess . project manager : now when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ? user interface : uh we we worked together , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : um and how we could like improve on the on the design . industrial designer : so it was a bit of both really , we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and i came up with that rhombus shape project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really . project manager : cool . industrial designer : it was fun . so well done with the management , i felt well managed . project manager : oh thanks . user interface : i think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , project manager : it 's kinda fun . user interface : and second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings . and i marketing : sorry . industrial designer : that happened to me all the time though . user interface : i know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : but i think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there . industrial designer : yeah , i was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we were n't getting we did n't really have enough information to make firm decisions , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but we were able to do it regardless , so . i 'm not usually a very decisive person , so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes . project manager : this is what we 'll do . user interface : yeah . project manager : i found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings . industrial designer : especially last time , user interface : yeah , for some of the meetings , yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah i think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , industrial designer : yeah , project manager : you know what i mean , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : like we we could n't answer every single question . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : um but industrial designer : right . and i i felt the first two meetings , that i was coming in with no information , and not sort of made me really like , ooh i do n't know , throwing together powerpoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite . i had so much information and so much to talk about . project manager : it was interesting what came out like later , like as i was doing the when i was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um , that more points came out from your presentation even . industrial designer : yeah . mm . project manager : um . i 'm a little i am a little disappointed that we did n't do a um something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point . industrial designer : yeah . that was something like in order to talk about that we would 've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like project manager : about yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : well the problem was , even when we just were creating from the excel file , there was n't like a option to select to somehow have it included , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so there was no we could be like yeah , it has it included . industrial designer : i think we were project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : there was no way for us to have project manager : considered the re industrial designer : yeah . marketing : written down that it was really there . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task . marketing : project manager : it 's interesting that they industrial designer : i think we really got into it , i mean i got into it as the day went on and i got really like , ooh i 'm designing a remote control , i dunno if that 's just me , project manager : mm-hmm , yeah . industrial designer : but project manager : it was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they did n't provide us with information to um we were n't provided with information to discuss that . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : i know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it 'll beep , but i but i 'm sure that would require some kind of technology industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : that i just do n't know what it is , but industrial designer : i think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you wo n't lose them . i dunno . i mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there 's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there 's only one tv and there 's only like three chairs . marketing : that 's like saying you 're never gon na lose your keys , and i always do , anyway . you 'll lose 'em in your pocket , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , there 's always ways to lose things . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it d yeah , it depends on how organised you are personally , but industrial designer : yeah , or like i guess what the setup of the house is too . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but , i mean i am notorious for losing my keys , project manager : industrial designer : i just i guess i 've just never lost the remote . i put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and could n't find them . user interface : industrial designer : 'cause i was putting groceries away . marketing : that 's funny . project manager : oh . industrial designer : you you 're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room . project manager : ca n't get in . industrial designer : ca n't get in , look all around the kitchen . definitely in the vegetable drawer . project manager : marketing : that 's funny . industrial designer : so . marketing : i always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat . industrial designer : but i guess it 's 'cause we do n't carry remotes around that much . marketing : yeah . ca n't really take it into the other room . industrial designer : yeah . maybe with our little robot one we could 've had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , i am located marketing : industrial designer : oh a g_p_s_ system , internal g_p_s_ . marketing : user interface : marketing : oh man . here you go . project manager : we should make one that walks by itself . industrial designer : although if it 's sitting still for too long . yes i user interface : marketing : that really could get up and walk away . project manager : or or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it 'll go zoom to the tv and stick there . industrial designer : or little or just just a wheel , you know . user interface : project manager : industrial designer : just if you like you 'd have a remote for your remote , that 'll . user interface : yeah . project manager : well , but if you could attach them to the tv , then you can . industrial designer : zoom yeah . hmm . all kinds of possibilities . project manager : mm . okay . sorry , i 'm just um trying to update my minutes . i decided to you know how i sent you the email saying that powerpoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : just gon na make i 'm making full minutes , so that it 'll include all of the agenda and all that . 'cause that seems a little more useful . industrial designer : wow . 'cause you 've had like the most typing and organising to do . project manager : but i did n't have like information to sloth through either , so industrial designer : yeah , i guess how much of your powerpoint was already done for you , every meeting . project manager : most of it , mm-hmm . i added slides , um i added a couple slides each time , but that was about it . industrial designer : okay . yeah , i did n't even think about adding slides , 'cause i would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in w did n't even think about adding more . project manager : well , the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , but it would n't have a slide for each point . and that 's the only way i remember that i need to go other that point . industrial designer : ah yeah . . project manager : i know personally when i do powerpoint , that 's what i do and so i had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and i would do your three . industrial designer : right . marketing : you have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like project manager : the slogan on it ? industrial designer : no , no , definitely not . project manager : no no no . marketing : okay good . industrial designer : we marketing : 'cause i was like , it could go around the outside . industrial designer : no , i do n't think we need to user interface : project manager : i think we just need the um the r_r_ , industrial designer : i think the r_ and r_ , especially if the yellow and black one . project manager : yeah . marketing : is it yellow and blue ? industrial designer : or yellow and blue . lem me go to the web page . project manager : yeah , i was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they did n't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or . marketing : oh i guess it is black , grey . grey is better than black , does n't look so bumblebeeish . project manager : i do n't really like yellow in general . marketing : hey now i understand the random like newsclippings . project manager : but it industrial designer : finish meeting now . project manager : was n't it interesting that um i thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um marketing : yes . project manager : the marketing choices , industrial designer : user interface : project manager : you know , like industrial designer : marketing : i will project manager : that was a bit of a conflict . marketing : i just feel like if you 're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you would n't just have like one set of source , industrial designer : marketing : it 's kind of an they were so not backed up , it would just be a sentence like we did a survey , this is what people said . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : s mm , i dunno . project manager : people are stupid . industrial designer : i guess it i it sort of a grey , is n't it ? yellow and grey , but then the slogan 's in blue . marketing : well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons , we 're good . industrial designer : yeah . well we do n't have the right colour clay anyway . project manager : maybe , like i do n't know . that could always be . industrial designer : well we 're not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , so . marketing : if they ever come out with potato industrial designer : potato mango shaped remotes . marketing : i 'm gon na have to project manager : i 'm claiming it intellectual property . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i ca n't believe a whole day is gone . i do n't feel like it 's been that long . marketing : i know ."
