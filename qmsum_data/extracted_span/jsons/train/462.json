    "answer": "john griffiths am : some questions on regional consortia , cabinet secretary , and , first of all , the role that you believe they should play and how schools use pdg . kirsty williams am : well , it 's an absolute\u2014 . it 's one of the things that i have been very clear to the regional consortia that i expect their challenge and support advisers to be asking schools about . so , one of the conversations that they need to have when they are in schools is exploring , with that school , how they are using their pdg , and how they 're demonstrating an impact for those resources . so , it 's a fundamental role for the challenge and support advisers in the regional consortia in their school improvement work . it 's crucial . john griffiths am : that sort of brings to mind some of the research that 's been done on the role of the challenge advisers , cabinet secretary , which suggested that they 're not actually challenging schools in that way , and that there 's very little evidence of schools changing their decisions on the use of pdg as a result of any challenge from those challenge advisers . so , how would you respond to those findings ? kirsty williams am : well , as i said , in my scrutiny of the role and success of our regional consortia , i specifically asked them about free-school-meal performance and the use of pdg within their particular region . i think there is increasing evidence to suggest that good use is being made of that resource , and i think that is being fed back into us . estyn tell us that it 's one of the areas of school expenditure that is closely linked to research and an evidence base . but , clearly , there is more to do , and that 's why we have appointed the new regional advisers for pdg going forward , because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level . john griffiths am : okay . so , you would recognise the findings from that research . kirsty williams am : yes . there 's always more that we can do , and we are strengthening that role by the appointment of the new regional pdg advisers , so that individual school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for , know what they should be doing , and there is a regional approach to good practice ."
