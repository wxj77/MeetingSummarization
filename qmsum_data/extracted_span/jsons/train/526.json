    "answer": "user interface : mm . i think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser industrial designer : yeah . user interface : because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by tv programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . if numbers , they 're easy , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : but if name the channel by by name industrial designer : well i think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the tv you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now and and uh marketing : no , we have a problem there . you see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you 've just say twenty five project manager : yeah it 's yeah . marketing : and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five . industrial designer : that 's right , yeah , yeah . marketing : so i think there should be a prefix to some numbers industrial designer : well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the tv so . user interface : yeah . marketing : i mean the the you just check all the probability that saying tv twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . industrial designer : yeah yeah . marketing : ordinary twenty five you almost there 's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent industrial designer : yeah but well okay . marketing : and tv twenty five i dunno it will be round about one or two percent . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so it 's better to have some prefix before the number . user interface : but i i i think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . marketing : yeah something , some code . user interface : you say numbe channel number five of the tv correspond to something else in the channel . industrial designer : yeah yeah . user interface : so some people may want to say , i want to see this channel . industrial designer : mm mm . well i marketing : that will be too big . project manager : or just marketing : and it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . user interface : yeah . check with the v r_ and d_ department the capability of recogniser . project manager : it 's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . it will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . user interface : uh ? project manager : because you have to s t uh a ch user interface : well , it 's convenient for the user . project manager : yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . marketing : als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . project manager : or maybe industrial designer : yeah . marketing : then project manager : or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , user interface : the uh uh mm . mm . project manager : just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . user interface : i i think that i have mm mm i think there 's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the tv screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let 's say it 's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want marketing : yeah , the . user interface : and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . so project manager : or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . user interface : mm . so you you do n't use the speech recogniser in that way . project manager : no . just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . user interface : oh , okay . yeah . industrial designer : well i uh i also project manager : by associating each channel with the name or industrial designer : i i also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching tv project manager : and for each one has his own . user interface : industrial designer : the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . marketing : yeah yeah , . industrial designer : because uh i remember when i was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time project manager : or you have to s user interface : yeah , i wan na watch this , i wan na watch that . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so it 's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching tv and say oh tv thirty and just run , s marketing : a and in the same lines we would have a one more problem . if we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : so i think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah . marketing : yeah that 's right that should be an option . industrial designer : yeah that 's well i think that 's a good uh a good option because it 's simple and uh simple to implement also , so . marketing : i think these are the practical problems . so we need to take care of them in the design . project manager : maybe we 'll discuss them in next meeting ."
