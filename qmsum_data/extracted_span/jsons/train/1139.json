    "query": "<s> what did user interface suggest about invisible features when discussing general functionalities of the remote control ?",
    "answer": "user interface : so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . and in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so , in terms of what this thing would actually look like marketing : user interface : despite working in interface design , i 'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you 'll have to forgive me . you 'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you do n't accidentally turn your tv off while you 're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . and then here you 'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your tv project manager : user interface : and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . so that if the user does n't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you do n't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . industrial designer : mm . mm-hmm . user interface : um , so again you can have a little lcd light somewhere , the flip thing and have i forgotten anything ? i do n't think so . so , as you can see , it 's a very very simple design , marketing : no . project manager : user interface : which is one of the things i really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different ."
