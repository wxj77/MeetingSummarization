    "answer": "user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but i think we have some technical problem or so . so i 'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control . project manager : maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do industrial designer : if fact project manager : i do n't know . industrial designer : yeah but do i have oh yeah . project manager : industrial designer : now i have enough cables . user interface : like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff . project manager : industrial designer : okay so i 'm just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy . we just have project manager : user interface : industrial designer : sorry , i 'm going project manager : okay . user interface : project manager : are you okay ? industrial designer : like that . i 'm just going to describe . basically we have a a battery a power supply here . after that we just have um user interface . let 's say that um something like that , which could be um a lcd let 's say or um an array of push button , something like that . push button or a lcd . after that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip . so i say u_c_ and i feed that to uh l_e_d_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component . and so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy . project manager : u_c_ is the central unit ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay yeah . industrial designer : y it 's a it 's this just a chip which does all the um numerical project manager : computation . industrial designer : numerical computation according to your display . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and so for us uh this is quite easy . we just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so for us this is quite easy . project manager : okay so this is quite easy . there is not that much constraints . industrial designer : yeah . um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple user interface : this will think this will take more time to develop also . industrial designer : yeah of course of course . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and um but for a standard one this is really easy . it 's a question of one month and so on s user interface : soon . project manager : to have a you s you speak about with voi voice control ? industrial designer : no no no no , project manager : standard button one . industrial designer : i say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that . user interface : yeah . so the only time problem is the sp voice recognition . marketing : industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : definitely . user interface : yeah . project manager : so do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ? user interface : ten years . industrial designer : i would say . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : i would say uh about eight months to have the first results . project manager : okay so i it 's a bit long yeah . industrial designer : yeah . i can um . project manager : one month for the standard one with button . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : even if we have a lcd display ? industrial designer : yeah even . i mean that this is really standard devices now . um eight . for uh speech recognition . project manager : okay yeah . okay so we can take this into account . so who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ? user interface : but we do n't have time to market . project manager : yeah it will . industrial designer : and also how much uh i think user interface : i think we should contact management . industrial designer : during the kickoff meeting you say that we we should n't we should n't go up to twelve point five euro per unit marketing : project manager : euros . yeah , yeah . industrial designer : so how many units should we sell to have a user interface : well . uh project manager : well each unit is is sell uh twenty five euros . industrial designer : yeah but how many yeah . user interface : how muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units . marketing : user interface : eh chips . we 're gon na need chips right . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . how much will it cost for one hundred thousand ? industrial designer : usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip . user interface : okay . project manager : because we are user interface : so you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition . industrial designer : yeah , user interface : yeah ? okay . industrial designer : we can project manager : it seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting . user interface : no it does n't . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : okay . four million . project manager : okay . maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement i receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have . industrial designer : um i just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta ? marketing : project manager : yeah i i will continue . industrial designer : is it project manager : well ask your question if you want . industrial designer : um you say that i do n't remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that 's it 's quite difficult to to to use the remote control . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? to to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that . marketing : would j uh yeah w i i think they they say that it 's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it , it 's it 's okay . industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : okay . it 's not intuitive first . industrial designer : and marketing : but yeah . industrial designer : but yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? you say that i want , i have six button user interface : mh-hmm . a a lot of people are uh if you have the lcd screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . but , but also it seems that industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but it will be hard to configure i mean imagine i uh project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so it 's really something for the expert user . so industrial designer : okay . user interface : i mean there are markets and markets . i think the young people are th uh are uh marketing : user interface : christine here said uh you have a industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : uh it is yeah . so for our young people uh it will be cool , they can be able to use it . th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . i guess . i do n't know if there is study about that . project manager : yeah . maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product . industrial designer : mm-hmm . yeah . yeah . yeah ."
