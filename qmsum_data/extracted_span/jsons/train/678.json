    "answer": "professor d : you know most of the time , even i mean even though it 's true that the overall number for danish we did n't improve it if you look at it individually , what it really says is that there 's , um , uh looks like out of the six cases , between the different kinds of , uh , matching conditions out of the six cases , there 's basically , um , a couple where it stays about the same , uh , three where it gets better , and one where it gets worse . phd a : yeah . professor d : uh , go ahead . phd a : y actually , uh , um , for the danish , there 's still some kind of mystery because , um , um , when we use the straight features , we are not able to get these nice number with the icsi ogi one , i mean . we do n't have this ninety - three seventy - eight , we have eight phd e : eighty - nine forty - four . phd a : yeah . uh , so , uh , that 's probably something wrong with the features that we get from ogi . uh , and sunil is working on on trying to to check everything . professor d : oh , and and we have a little time on that and actually so we have a little bit of time on that , actually . phd a : yeah . professor d : we have a day or so , so when when when do you folks leave ? phd a : uh , sunday . professor d : sunday ? so so , uh yeah , until saturday midnight , or something , we have w we we have time , yeah . well , that would be good . that 'd be good . phd a : yeah . professor d : yeah . uh , and , you know , i u when whenever anybody figures it out they should also , for sure , email hynek because hynek will be over there telling people what we did , so he should know . phd a : mmm . yeah . professor d : good , ok . so , um so , we 'll we 'll hold off on that a little bit . i mean , even with these results as they are , it 's it 's it 's really not that bad . but but , uh , um and it looks like the overall result as they are now , even without , you know , any any bugs being fixed is that , uh , on the the other tasks , we had this average of , uh , forty uh nine percent , or so , improvement . and here we have somewhat better than that than the danish , and somewhat worse than that on the german , but i mean , it sounds like , uh , one way or another , the methods that we 're doing can reduce the error rate from from mel ceptrum down by , you know a fourth of them to , uh , a half of them . somewhere in there , depending on the exact case . so so that 's good . i mean , i think that , uh , one of the things that hynek was talking about was understanding what was in the other really good proposals and and trying to see if what should ultimately be proposed is some , uh , combination of things . um , if , uh cuz there 's things that they are doing there that we certainly are not doing . and there 's things that we 're doing that they 're not doing . and and they all seem like good things ."
