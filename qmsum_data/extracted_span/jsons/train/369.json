    "answer": "user interface : but um , i 've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause i think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know , industrial designer : stable thing , that 's right . to have , user interface : i think everyone has has agreed that it 's that it could be quite a useful um thing , so . industrial designer : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . user interface : but i think it 's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , because it 's it 's the volume i it 's , you know it 's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so . industrial designer : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . user interface : but um , i 've also included this turbo button because i think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , and well marketing : what 's a turbo button ? user interface : so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the tv is not gon na be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what 's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they 're doing . marketing : it con it controls the speed ? user interface : yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if i 'm if i 'm going if i 'm scrolling past them and you know , it 's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it 's really going fast or whatever . project manager : user interface : so yeah , that 's um , those are the two important uh features i think we need on the remote , industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : but i mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um . you know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wan na have like a very cheap kind of device , i mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it 's gon na be a banana , you know that 's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that does n't have that much functionality , it 's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it 's hard to get so many buttons on a banana project manager : it 's enough . user interface : and it 's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , um you know , what other buttons do we want ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : i mean we could have well , i guess you need an on and off switch , project manager : switch on . yeah ."
