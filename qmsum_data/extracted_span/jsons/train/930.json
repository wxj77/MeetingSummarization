    "query": "<s> what were their opinions on support or changes of circumstances ?",
    "answer": "helen mary jones am : that 's really good to hear . and have you given any special ministerial instruction to student finance wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances , or is that something that 's kind of ongoing at the moment ? kirsty williams am : those conversations are ongoing with the student loans company . as i said , we anticipate no disruption to\u2014 . we do n't anticipate any change in the approach to students as a result of this . individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the student loans company would respond to that . all i would say is , just to remind people : people who work for the student loans company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else . there will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery , simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the government . so , i think we just need to bear that in mind : that these organisations are doing their best , but , if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus , then i hope people will give them due consideration . helen mary jones am : yes , that makes sense , of course , because we 've been told that universities wo n't be able to entirely close , because there will be students who ca n't go home\u2014 kirsty williams am : it is their home . helen mary jones am : \u2014overseas students , for example . what discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students ' basic needs are met , that there 's still food , shelter , whatever they need ? kirsty williams am : well , obviously , universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances , and every conversation that huw 's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that ."
