    "answer": "industrial designer : uh we obviously do n't want wires on this thing . uh typically it would be a battery , but i 'm open to suggestions . um and then we have the the user interface . oops . and the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . so those are the basic things that we 've got to get in for our twelve euros fifty . thank you . project manager : hmm . okay . right . but those things as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what what does it look like ? what do the buttons look like ? uh what does it feel like ? that 's where the user interface is really coming into its own . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : the technical end is what 's actually gon na be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . for example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? um is there any um because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for d_v_d_s , movies , whatever . um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? industrial designer : well i may be wrong here , but i 'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . we 're trying to sell four million of 'em , um that 's that 's , you know , that 's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . um and i had n't thought of it as being a reparable thing , project manager : okay ."
