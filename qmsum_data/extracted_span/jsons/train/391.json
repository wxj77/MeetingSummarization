    "answer": "dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . in the draft plan , some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks , and that sort of thing . do you think that , if we go down that road , there 's going to be time within this assembly to introduce such legislation ? and , if not , what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation ? dr frank atherton : it may well be that there are things in wales that we might wish to legislate on , and you 've mentioned two of them , and they 're good examples . we would , obviously , need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and , in a way , we need to mirror what 's happening in england and in scotland to some degree around the consultations they 're having on energy drinks . we also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that . as to your question of legislative time , i 'm not really in a position to answer that . what i could say is that legislation may well be one of the outcomes of the consultation . there may well be things that we wish to choose to legislate on . the timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures , and i come back to the point that legislation , of course , is one of the tools that we 've got\u2014we need to deploy them all . dawn bowden am : sure , i understand that , that you could do other things . i know\u2014 . we 've heard from the government , on other calls for legislation , that the programme 's very tight , certainly for this term , so i was just wondering whether we might get that in , but okay . if i turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of ; i 'd just welcome your view on this , because , when we discussed with stakeholders , we talked about whether the planning system , for instance , could be used to , as an example , restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on . would that be a measure that you would support , something like that ? dr frank atherton : i think it 's definitely something we want to look at and , of course , that question is asked in the consultation , so we would like to know people 's views on that . it 's an interesting one . i think there is a question\u2014a really important question\u2014about how we can use the planning system more effectively . i 've discussed with nathan on a number of occasions , with planning colleagues in welsh government and in local authorities , about the art of the possible , let 's say . there may be things that we could think about and we want to get those ideas through the consultation . the specific question around takeaways , particularly takeaways near schools , is often asked . i was very interested to see , up in the north-east , some time ago , that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools , or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high . i understand london is now\u2014some london boroughs are now\u2014experimenting with that as well . so , that gave me comfort , because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively . i think my view at the moment is that the jury 's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they 're going to be . but the fact that we have some initiatives around the uk does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then , if it is shown to be beneficial , to think about that here in wales , yes . dawn bowden am : sure , because it will only be one of a suite of measures anyway . of itself , it would n't address the problem , but , added to other initiatives , i guess it would . can i just ask you briefly , then , about community sport infrastructure and , in particular , of new schools ? so , welsh government , as you know , has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme . what we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently , particularly headteachers , was that , in some of the new schools that have been built , we have n't had changing rooms and toilet facilities , for instance , built into the new buildings . so , if we 're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public , actually , more active , do you think that 's something that we ought to be building in ? again , not your particular direct area of responsibility , but something that you might have an input into , is that , when we 're developing schools , we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public . is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around ? dr frank atherton : well , it 's certainly a fascinating area and one that i think has a lot of potential . it goes\u2014 . you 're right to raise it in the context of schools , and i can understand why this committee would , but i think it goes beyond that , actually , into all developments in the public sector and how they 're developed and whether we 're building health into our environment , which perhaps is your starting point . one of the things that i was really pleased to see in terms of the public health ( wales ) act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool , and we 're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through government , but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using . and so i would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions . if you apply that kind of lens and you take the point , which is inherent in your question , i think , that schools are not just for kids , they 're for communities , then you would\u2014it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way . so , on a personal basis , i would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres . there are all kinds of barriers in there , and i understand all of that , and it 's not really my field , exactly as you say , but , as a matter of principle , i think it 's a good one to pursue . dawn bowden am : okay . thank you . and widening it out to other public services buildings as well . dr frank atherton : indeed ."
