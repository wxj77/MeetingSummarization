industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : so maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so user interface : what what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ? marketing : user interface : what you mean clothe industrial designer : spongy means it it 's like sp marketing : fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in milan ? user interface : no , i missed that one . marketing : yeah , i i did n't miss an project manager : user interface : industrial designer : marketing : i did n't miss and i saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . user interface : oh , they 're okay so they 're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay . marketing : no no , not not yet , not yet . project manager : marketing : yeah , yeah . user interface : so we 're not gon na have a remote control in the shape of of a banana , marketing : so te textu textures , yeah . user interface : just maybe marketing : yeah . user interface : marketing : vegetable textures and all this kind . project manager : drawings of bananas . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : uh user interface : okay and project manager : uh-huh . marketing : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : but what 's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? project manager : well so this is in the next slide certainly . marketing : uh no no , it 's not . project manager : it 's not ? user interface : marketing : it 's user interface : so which fruit are you thinking of ? marketing : and um . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : i ha i have n't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : but yeah it it depends on the project manager : so maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the lcd . user interface : oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit , project manager : user interface : or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the industrial designer : means buttons are in the shape of fruits , marketing : yeah maybe the shape the shape industrial designer : buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that . marketing : no , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . project manager : apple for channel one . industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . marketing : so we should n't be at re really attached to to the trend user interface : so something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant . marketing : but for instance , yeah . african or as an elephant ? industrial designer : that we can discuss afterwards . project manager : okay . user interface : but okay , marketing : user interface : i 'm not , i 'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but i do n't know about uh i dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is . marketing : well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . i think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices user interface : to fruit ? marketing : and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control . user interface : but is it uh is fruit cool ? marketing : what ? project manager : that 's a question . marketing : what ? user interface : is fruit cool ? marketing : yeah ? uh is the new trend of the user interface : well i guess , you know , apple has the ipod so , imagi marketing : user interface : just 'cause they have an apple on their on their product , does n't mean fruit is cool . marketing : no i think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some user interface : okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , you do n't wan na pear or a watermelon . marketing : yeah . don do n't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? user interface : well , probably the only thing is a banana that i can think of , industrial designer : banana . user interface : a cucumber . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : maybe too long . user interface : i dunno . maybe . too green . marketing : maybe . project manager : user interface : so , but i mean you also have to you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and you know . project manager : a banana . marketing : um user interface : it 's , it marketing : yeah . user interface : the thing is you have t normally with um with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you 're gon na have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build . project manager : industrial designer : i do n't th it will be rolling a lot . marketing : yeah but i li i like your idea that we should n't have a lot of buttons b buttons so project manager : okay . yeah and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a lcd on a banana also . user interface : yeah . marketing : uh do you want a an lcd with twenty five euros ? project manager : well , you 're the marketing expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . user interface : well , this is marketing : i think well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , project manager : marketing : so , i will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the project manager : so so you you you suggest to go f marketing : new inputs and also it 's i 'm not convinced about this lcd because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , it 's not just buying a new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying uh project manager : okay . s so you 're simply marketing : more things . it 's not so simple . project manager : you 're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons . marketing : for instance , yeah . yeah for for for given an an example yeah . project manager : okay good . so maybe you can go ahead ?"
