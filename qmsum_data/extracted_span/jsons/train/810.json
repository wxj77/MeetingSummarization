    "answer": "marketing : i 'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo everyone will s will buy it . user interface : actually i 'm not so sure industrial designer : so if we go with just the user interface : because i 'm the marketing : i 'm sure . user interface : you know if i was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because i ca n't hear it very well , i do n't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when i 'm when i 'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control . you know if there 's some there 's some dialogue all of a sudden that i ca n't hear , i 'm trying to actually find out what 's being said , project manager : yeah . user interface : so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps . project manager : okay so marketing : yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it 's about user interface : well it depends if it 's a remote control th marketing : it 's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that . user interface : maybe if the remote control is something that y you do n't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion . marketing : user interface : if you can leave it sitting on the table and you do n't actually have to find it , then that could be . industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now . industrial designer : alright . project manager : um so if i if i kind of summarise everything we 've de we we said . we are targeting tv . we need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . um we have marketing : with a good shape for the project manager : or good shape , yes . we should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . maybe this is something we can stick to it . and um also , a very interesting things i i i 've seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . so so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it 's not possible to go s to go to lcd and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . uh first m m why not to go to lcd . because um in fact as we are targeting uh tv in fact we can use tv screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have . user interface : well it depends though well it depends . if we we do n't unless we have some input some video input to the tv or we have control over the tv then we ca n't actually display that . like if we if we produce the tvs then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the tv to superimpose those those menus . so that 's an extra project manager : yeah that 's right . don do n't you ha user interface : cost . project manager : do n't we have contacts with uh people on tv or or well systems that exist that we can use ? user interface : well this is this is another que we still have n't really defined the remote . are we still you say we 're focusing on tv , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it 's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ? project manager : yeah . user interface : 'cause that really makes a big difference . 'cause even if we have contacts we ca n't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies ' tvs . it 's just there are too many tvs out there . it 's it 's not really gon na project manager : yeah . that 's good point . what 's what cou what could be the cost of uh well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to lcd on the remote control ? user interface : for twenty five euro ? i think it 's impossible . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : it 's not possible . it 's impossible . user interface : but but i dunno , marketing : yeah . user interface : i think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro i think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . so i would i would like to know if there 's any chance of of increasing the uh marketing : uh user interface : of increasing the unit price . project manager : so you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value ? marketing : what would be user interface : yeah . yeah . yeah project manager : okay , user interface : because yeah . project manager : so regarding the automatic speech recognition , i think this is marketing : wha but what would be one question , what would be the goal of putting an lcd in a remote control ? user interface : well th marketing : what what kind of information ? user interface : 'cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . marketing : yeah but mo most of the tvs nowadays show the show the project manager : they have tele teletext . well , because they have teletext on it . th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel . marketing : yeah but yeah most of the tvs have teletext nowadays . project manager : they have t most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet . marketing : yeah . project manager : so to to uh user interface : you can get a lot more information on it . project manager : to browse more easily the teletext . for instance through uh through your remote control . marketing : so what would what would appear in the in the lcd ? user interface : so you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it 's up to . project manager : the ti the start time , all the p all the programmes you could have uh o user interface : you could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something marketing : okay . user interface : so you can quickly just kind of even without reading project manager : well i do n't know if this information is available from teletext , also . user interface : well no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there . they may not have pictures , but maybe they do . industrial designer : are user interface : there 's dependi it also depends on the country . project manager : well because for the same reason that we can not uh informations on the tv . we c we could n't grab information information which is not there . user interface : no but i mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . so it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . uh . project manager : so so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the tv , or uh or it should be a special tv connected to marketing : but yeah . user interface : well i i think if we 're gon na i think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y i do n't think you could even get teletext information from the tv onto the remote control , especially if we do n't control the tv . project manager : user interface : i dunno . we need to find that out . project manager : okay . we need to close the meeting . um so industrial designer : but just a small thing , project manager : very quickly . industrial designer : what kind of market we are targeting ? is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? so the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of lcd thing could be as high as the tv itself . that is very important . project manager : yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their , user interface : if it 's a really small tv maybe . industrial designer : broke . okay . okay . project manager : and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have . industrial designer : okay . okay . okay . okay . project manager : so this is that we z that that we should target . so the com the um the uh the committment is the following , we do n't go for speech recognition technology . the lcd is still on disc is still open to discussion . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : it is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . so marketing : i think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the lcd . industrial designer : it 's it 's cheaper as compared to the lcd . project manager : yeah , but not sure . maybe it 's cheaper , but we have no marketing : because with the lcd you need more requirements . you need a internet connection . you need m more things . user interface : well the thing is i think i think the type of peop marketing : for the speech recognition you you do n't need anything . you just say channel fifty , and that 's it . user interface : i think the type of people that are gon na want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gon na have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know . marketing : but then we should move to another target b because at twenty five dollars , industrial designer : means th yeah twenty five euros is yeah , that 's right . user interface : well this is what we need to find out . marketing : it 's user interface : can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? 'cause otherwise we need project manager : okay this is this is an open question for you . yeah . this is uh up to you to tell us . but i 'm definitely not keen on to to marketing : to move to another target ?"
