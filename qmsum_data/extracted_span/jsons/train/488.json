    "query": "<s> did the prime minister agree with mr. pierre paul-hus when talking about introduction of petitions and prioritization of government matters ?",
    "answer": "mr. pierre paul-hus ( charlesbourghaute-saint-charles , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . although we are right in the middle of a pandemic and the government has agreed to set aside all parliamentary business in order to concentrate solely on eliminating the virus in canada and its impacts , the prime minister is deceiving canadians by introducing measures to punish law-abiding firearm owners . why ? right hon . justin trudeau ( prime minister ) : mr.chair , i feel that all canadians were affected by the massacre in nova scotia . once again , too many families are facing tragedy and tremendous grief . during the last election campaign , we promised to ban military-style assault weapons , and that is exactly what we have done . we will be working with members from all parties in order to continue strengthening gun control . it is a shame that , once more , the conservatives do not want to strengthen gun control in the country . mr. pierre paul-hus : mr.chair , i understand the prime minister 's reply . however , i would like to know whether he considers that , with this order in council , organized crime , street gangs and other criminals are simply going to turn in their weapons . right hon . justin trudeau : this is indeed only a first step , but it is an important one . we are doing other things to eliminate or restrict handguns in our municipalities , to strengthen the control at our borders , and to implement other measures . i am pleased to hear the hon . member speak of those measures , because we are going to work together in the house to strengthen gun control . i hope that the conservative party will be part of that discussion in a positive way , in order to keep canadians safe . mr. pierre paul-hus : mr.chair , i can simply say to the prime minister that the conservative party has always been committed to battling criminals , not law-abiding citizens . speaking of criminals , we know that , even before the pandemic , the prime minister had asked the parole board of canada to release prisoners more easily and more quickly . now we are learning that , because of the pandemic , some releases are happening very quickly . the minister of public safety told us that the people were approaching the end of their sentences or were older , but we are learning in the media that some dangerous criminals are being released . can the prime minister give us an explanation ? right hon . justin trudeau : the protection , the safety and the health of all canadians are important for the government . this is why we have taken additional measures in our correctional services to ensure that guards and inmates are protected . we have indeed opened the doors to some more speedy releases , but only in very specific cases that present little or no danger for canadians . we have managed to find the right balance . we must protect canadians and we must also ensure that they are safe . those two things go hand-in-hand ."
