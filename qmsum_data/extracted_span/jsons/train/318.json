    "answer": "postdoc f : and w and w and , you know , is a it would be wonderful if , uh , it 's possible then to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels after that but , um , you know , i 've th the so , i i do n't know exactly where that 's going at this point . but m i was experimenting with doing this by hand and i really do think that it 's wise that we 've had them start the way we have with , uh , m y working off the mixed signal , um , having the interface that does n't require them to do the ti uh , the time bins for every single channel at a t uh , through the entire interaction . professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : um , i did discover a couple other things by doing this though , and one of them is that , um , um , once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber . professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : as you might expect , professor a : sure . postdoc f : because when it 's a b backchannel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap . and if we 're gon na study types of overlaps , which is what i wan na do , an analysis of that , then that really does require listening { comment } to every single channel all the way through the entire { comment } length for all the different speakers . now , for only four speakers , that 's not gon na be too much time , but if it 's nine speakers , then that i that is more time . so it 's li you know , kind of wondering and i think again it 's like this it 's really valuable that thilo 's working on the speech - nonspeech segmentation because maybe , um , we can close in on that wi without having to actually go to the time that it would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish through every single meeting . phd e : yeah , but those backchannels will always be a problem i think . uh especially if they 're really short and they 're not very loud and so it it can it it will always happen that also the automatic s detection system will miss some of them , so . postdoc f : ok . well so then then , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : just so that they 're they 're not being overlooked because of that , and count on accuracy during the sparser phases . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : cuz there are large s spaces of the that 's a good point . there are large spaces where there 's no overlap at all . someone 's giving a presentation , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : or whatever . that 's that 's a good that 's a good thought . and , um , let 's see , there was one other thing i was gon na say . i i think it 's really interesting data to work with , i have to say , it 's very enjoyable . i really , not not a problem spending time with these data . really interesting . and not just because i 'm in there . no , it 's real interesting . professor a : uh , well i think it 's a short meeting . uh , you 're you 're you 're still in the midst of what you 're doing from what you described last time , i assume , phd c : is true . professor a : and phd c : i have n't results , eh , yet professor a : yeah . phd c : but , eh , i i 'm continue working with the mixed signal now , { comment } after the the last experience . professor a : yeah . yeah . phd c : and and i 'm tried to to , uh , adjust the to to improve , eh , an harmonicity , eh , detector that , eh , i i implement . professor a : yeah . phd c : but i have problem because , eh , i get , eh , eh , very much harmonics now . professor a : yeah . phd c : um , harmonic possi possible harmonics , uh , eh , and now i 'm i 'm i 'm trying to to find , eh , some kind of a , um of h of help , eh , using the energy to to distinguish between possible harmonics , and and other fre frequency peaks , that , eh , corres not harmonics . and , eh , i have to to talk with y with you , with the group , eh , about the instantaneous frequency , because i have , eh , an algorithm , and , i get , mmm , eh , t t results similar results , like , eh , the paper , eh , that i i am following . but , eh , the the rules , eh , that , eh , people used in the paper to to distinguish the harmonics , is does n't work well . professor a : mm - hmm . phd c : and i i i i not sure that i eh , the the way o to ob the way to obtain the the instantaneous frequency is right , or it 's it 's not right . eh , professor a : yeah . phd c : i have n't enough file feeling to to to distinguish what happened . professor a : yeah , i 'd like to talk with you about it . if if if , uh if i do n't have enough time and y you wan na discuss with someone else some someone else besides us that you might want to talk to , uh , might be stephane . phd c : yeah . i talked with stephane and and thilo professor a : yeah and and thilo , yeah . yeah , but phd c : they nnn they they { comment } they did n't phd e : i 'm not too experienced with harmonics professor a : i see . phd c : they think that { comment } the experience is not enough to phd e : and phd g : is is this the algorithm where you hypothesize a fundamental , and then get the energy for all the harmonics of that fundamental ? phd c : no , no it 's no no . no . phd g : and then hypothesize a new fundamental and get the energy professor a : yeah , that 's wh phd c : no . i i i i do n't proth process the the fundamental . i i , ehm i calculate the the phase derivate using the fft . professor a : yeah . phd c : and the algorithm said that , eh , if you if you change the the the , eh , nnn the x - the frequency `` x `` , eh , using the in the instantaneous frequency , you can find , eh , how , eh , in several frequencies that proba probably the the harmonics , eh , professor a : uh - huh . phd c : the errors of peaks the frequency peaks , eh , eh , move around these , eh eh frequency harmonic the frequency of the harmonic . and , eh , if you if you compare the the instantaneous frequency , eh , of the of the , eh , continuous , eh , eh , filters , that , eh that , eh , they used eh , to to to get , eh , the the instantaneous frequency , professor a : mm - hmm . phd c : it probably too , you can find , eh , that the instantaneous frequency for the continuous , eh , eh the output of the continuous filters are very near . and in my case i in equal with our signal , it does n't happened . professor a : yeah . i 'd hafta look at that and think about it . phd c : and professor a : it 's it 's it 's i have n't worked with that either so i 'm not sure the way the simple - minded way i suggested was what chuck was just saying , is that you could make a a sieve . you know , y you actually say that here is phd c : yeah . professor a : let 's let 's hypothesize that it 's this frequency or that frequency , and and , uh , maybe you maybe you could use some other cute methods to , uh , short cut it by by uh , making some guesses , phd c : yeah . professor a : but but uh uh uh , i would , uh i mean you could make some guesses from , uh from the auto - correlation or something but but then , given those guesses , try , um , uh , only looking at the energy at multiples of the of that frequency , and and see how much of the take the one that 's maximum . call that the phd c : yeah . professor a : but phd c : using the energy of the of the multiple of the frequency . professor a : of all the harmonics of that . yeah . phd c : yeah . phd g : do you hafta do some kind of , uh , low - pass filter before you do that ? phd c : i do n't use . phd g : or phd c : but , i i know many people use , eh , low - pass filter to to to get , eh , the pitch . professor a : no . to get the pitch , yes . phd c : i do n't use . to get the pitch , yes . phd e : to get the pitch , yeah . phd c : but the harmonic , no . phd g : but i but the harmonics are gon na be , uh , uh , i do n't know what the right word is . um , they 're gon na be dampened by the uh , vocal tract , right ? the response of the vocal tract . professor a : yeah ? phd c : yeah ?"
