marketing : yeah that that 's yeah . i uh i sure did . and it combines with product evaluation . uh so project manager : uh you put it in the . marketing : we all have to keep in mind what has changed now . so what we have left on the because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . project manager : yeah . marketing : alright . project manager : f_ five . marketing : let 's make it big . um well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . true or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a scale , as we all know it . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : user interface : marketing : um well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . um well they are in a word document , which i will open now . project manager : alt up marketing : yeah . i do n't know it 's open yet . no . and we all have to uh agree on a certain level . what 's this ? project manager : freaky . marketing : oh . i do n't know . um well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . so that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . how do you think about that ? industrial designer : i think it does . because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of lcd , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : right ? project manager : uh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh marketing : yeah the us u it it industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it 's it 's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so do you think industrial designer : well , we have extended menus , on the on the lcd screen . so marketing : yeah . you can you can ma yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . that 's true . i mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen . industrial designer : i no . marketing : so on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ? user interface : two or three . two or three . marketing : huh ? two or three ? something like that ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : well we have to choose one . so uh what do you say ? project manager : uh y we should fill this in now . marketing : i agree on two . project manager : yeah okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : uh marketing : i uh i say two , personally . but project manager : yeah in the new design i s would say it 's three . but now , in original design i say two . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah alright . marketing : yeah well we have to evaluate i guess what we have now . project manager : okay then i say three . marketing : yeah ? you say three , industrial designer : yeah yeah . marketing : and you you said al also three ? user interface : yeah . marketing : three ? okay well i say still two , but it has to be three then . project manager : hey , you 're marketing , eh . user interface : marketing : yeah i know . so it 's made bold . but it 's nah , it 's not very clear on the sc project manager : hmm . m maybe underline . user interface : or give it a colour . marketing : maybe other colour , yeah . that 's better . project manager : red . marketing : uh yeah . alright . oh , it does n't have to be bold anymore . project manager : oh yeah very true . user interface : marketing : alright . yeah . user interface : yeah true one . marketing : um well the remote control has wha project manager : he types everything . industrial designer : definitely one . it has to be . user interface : yeah . marketing : the remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . for example audio settings and screen settings . user interface : it hides uh basic functions . project manager : everything . you do n't use anything else . marketing : yeah . well , yeah . so it it 's a very true point . i mean it hides all those function . industrial designer : you 're not gon na find them . project manager : yeah . yeah okay . yeah . user interface : yeah true . marketing : but , i mean uh they 're hidden in the screen . if you do n't want to use them , you do n't s you s just scroll over them . and you place them project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : f i do n't know where . so that 's very true , i guess , for our case . industrial designer : yeah the next not so much so . marketing : uh the second point . it shows the relevant and most used functions . project manager : nope . marketing : power button . do we ha still have a power button ? project manager : uh check with the excel sheet . marketing : well yeah the button 's integrated , huh ? user interface : i think we are industrial designer : yeah . yeah it 's uh it 's integrated . marketing : yeah we dropped it . you j you just push it in for user interface : it 's in oh yeah it was integrateds . yeah . project manager : yeah integrate it . marketing : yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then project manager : yeah . industrial designer : e exactly just like a m mobile . marketing : yeah . i do n't know . project manager : just go scrolling and it will activate . user interface : marketing : yeah . um it shows the relevant and most used functions . industrial designer : . marketing : yeah uh on the other uh on one side i would say yes , and the other side i would say no . so it 's i do n't know . project manager : it shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but user interface : can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? marketing : yeah . user interface : no , you have to scroll through the menu , before marketing : with the scroll butt yeah and then say channel . and then user interface : yeah . so it 's it 's not industrial designer : well uh we should b build it so that if you do n't kind of push into the menu or something , if when it 's on , yeah , it 's turned on , project manager : you say you double click on the industrial designer : it automatically has the the programme and the volume function , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some of you marketing : yeah . industrial designer : or you double click it . marketing : but but how do you change from volume to channel ? project manager : industrial designer : no because it has four arrows , right ? project manager : no , not anymore . user interface : no . marketing : no . project manager : because he 's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in . industrial designer : oh yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : like on the the mouse . industrial designer : yeah i was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick . marketing : no we have n we have no buttons left . so the joystick was not an option . industrial designer : yeah that is a bummer . marketing : so so you hav project manager : yeah . marketing : so you you have to double-click , i mean , for , i mean , uh volume , project manager : to get into menu . yeah . marketing : and three double click for the menu , or something . user interface : oh no . project manager : or hold it ten seconds . industrial designer : we 'll make it a morse code . marketing : yeah . yeah . yeah . alright . user interface : marketing : but but ease of use was not very important , may i remind you . project manager : no no no . uh it should be trendy . marketing : so that 's user interface : industrial designer : marketing : yeah but that that 's not a question . industrial designer : marketing : uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . user interface : marketing : well i think it 's pretty much in the middle . project manager : yeah . four . marketing : you have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . so project manager : yeah , im in the menu . user interface : seven . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so maybe it 's more like a f a five . or user interface : yeah . five . industrial designer : yeah i would go for five or six , yeah . marketing : yeah . five or six ? project manager : five . user interface : five . yep . industrial designer : okay five . marketing : five ? alright . industrial designer : let 's not diss our remote . user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's the weirdest remote control i 've ever seen . so marketing : oh . yeah . industrial designer : yep . just one button . project manager : well it 's different . marketing : yeah . alright . uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like lcd screen and speech recognition . industrial designer : but uh yep . project manager : yeah . marketing : well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . but it has at least one innovation . project manager : yeah , it 's still yeah , i say two . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we still have the fruit and vegetable print . marketing : i say two then . project manager : oh , that 's the next . marketing : yeah but that that 's not that 's not this question . uh thi uh that 's the other question . industrial designer : fr oh i mean the oh never mind . i 'm a bit lost . project manager : marketing : this one . user interface : i think a two . no . marketing : two yeah . industrial designer : . marketing : i think lcd 's more useful than speech project manager : yeah definitely . marketing : what ? oh not the bold one . industrial designer : it 's way more practical , yeah . marketing : right . okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it should have been two questions . i realise now , because sponge-like material is dropped . project manager : marketing : but the look and feel project manager : you still have rubber d or no . industrial designer : yeah . so we still uh we still have the primary colours . but only on the on the outside , not on the button . user interface : no you got a plastic . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : the button has also colour . yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah ? project manager : the one button we have . industrial designer : okay . marketing : yeah . the one . industrial designer : yeah . yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . project manager : yeah you could check with the excel sheet . marketing : mm mm . user interface : yeah . you only have one yeah . marketing : yeah we have single curve now , industrial designer : and and colour . marketing : and no and no material industrial designer : yeah . s marketing : . so maybe in the middle or something . project manager : yeah . user interface : four . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , i mean it 's project manager : yeah or three . industrial designer : uh marketing : worth the yeah . project manager : we have something . industrial designer : actually we d we did n't do so well on this one . because it 's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . still , it 's still hard . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i mean the sponge-like and the three d_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . project manager : new . yeah . marketing : yeah . but then we would have to drop the screen . user interface : red . marketing : oh red . yeah . project manager : you like both . marketing : yeah . i like bold . project manager : marketing : uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . project manager : um oh yeah . user interface : mm yeah yeah . industrial designer : of course . project manager : i just could n't marketing : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : you just have to draw it . project manager : um , just one minute . user interface : it 's the white part uh industrial designer : yeah but it be because uh we could n't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the project manager : . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : so user interface : we have a we have a industrial designer : so i mean i wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . but marketing : but there 's uh enough space for the corporate logo . i mean , if there 's only one thing . industrial designer : hell yeah . if we have only one button . marketing : yeah . so i will say that is very true . project manager : . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an r_ and the reversed r_ , user interface : industrial designer : does n't it ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so marketing : the remote control is easy to use . well i would say skill , uh i would say six , or something . i do n't think it 's easy to use , or not so . industrial designer : the only e the only thing easy about it is that you do n't have to move your fingers . 'cause it has only one button . marketing : yeah . user interface : and that you only have to control one button . industrial designer : yeah exactly . marketing : yeah . it it it has a nice screen . but yeah . user interface : it gives visual feedback . so marketing : yeah . well i i would say a five or a six . user interface : i think a five . five . industrial designer : i would say six . marketing : what do you say ? easy to use ? five or a six ? industrial designer : it 's really not easy to use . user interface : project manager : no not anymore . user interface : industrial designer : 'cause you 're putting everything marketing : so a six , more . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , uh i would go for the six too . so user interface : okay . yeah . industrial designer : most votes count . um project manager : marketing : user interface : marketing : um well , another question , user interface : yeah that looks uh great . marketing : uh the remote control is durable . user interface : marketing : i do n't know if that 's the correct word . user interface : yeah . nah industrial designer : definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic marketing : but uh in use , both battery as casing ? industrial designer : yeah . yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . marketing : yeah ? true , true . industrial designer : and the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever . marketing : and the casing is plastic , ? yeah . if you do n't drop it too much , it 's uh should last pretty long . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so i would go for one . marketing : yeah ? but uh i think rubber compared is better . so i think a two is more appropriate user interface : yeah . s project manager : industrial designer : okay yeah . marketing : than user interface : wow . marketing : yeah . logo . project manager : yeah . user interface : marketing : okay i will go go for two . uh the last one ? the remote control 's a good example for company 's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . industrial designer : oh . no m user interface : no we put the electronics into the fashion . project manager : yeah well yeah . industrial designer : i would g marketing : uh turn around . yeah . but um industrial designer : i would go for four . project manager : no marketing : yeah ? industrial designer : because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . marketing : it 's not yeah , true . project manager : yeah okay . marketing : so a four . it 's it g it g goes , it 's not the best we could do , i guess . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but it all has to do with the budget , because it 's it 's not the bad idea we had , so industrial designer : yeah . yeah yeah . user interface : yeah , four is okay . marketing : alright , yeah . right . project manager : so industrial designer : that 's it . marketing : so if i understood it right , we have to count these numbers . project manager : ooh . and yeah ? what ? marketing : uh yeah . mm-hmm . oh project manager : yeah . marketing : oh alright . word document , the project manager : yeah . that marketing : yeah we have to count them . project manager : count them . add them ?
