    "answer": "kirsty williams am : well , it 's not something i wish i could do ; i think that we 're doing it . self-praise is no recommendation , but , because of the working relationship that we have , i think we 're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes . so , i 've just talked about living wage ; we 're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders ' pay , the gender pay gap within institutions . for instance , as part of this government 's commitment to improving mental health , we 've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector . these are national priorities and we 're acting upon them and we 're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities . and , i have to say , universities have risen to that challenge , and i 'm very grateful to them for doing that . i think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration . i think what sets us apart in wales is that this government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation , which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in england . that 's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new pcet reforms\u2014to create collaboration , not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector . so , this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration , not just , as i said , in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector . we 're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication , we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available , where , sometimes , those students find barriers ."
