    "query": "<s> did kirsty williams ' attitude towards the baccalaureate change after the discussion about universities ' views on it ?",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : i do n't agree . hefin david am : do you think that that 's a view that 's held within universities , and are you concerned about that ? because it is a view that 's obviously held within cardiff university . kirsty williams am : no ; i would say that that is a view held by an individual in cardiff university\u2014 hefin david am : who has influence over students . kirsty williams am : well , that is a view held by an individual in cardiff university . and , actually , cardiff university\u2014indeed , all welsh universities\u2014accept the welsh baccalaureate as an a-level equivalent . i think it is really important to reflect on the wide range of opportunities at higher education that the welsh bac affords individuals . that means that it is deemed as an equivalent to a-level for the vast majority of universities , to get in to some of the most competitive courses , such as dentistry , medicine , veterinary science . so , those courses where we know there 's a high demand and high competition for places , there are institutions that are using that , including cardiff to get into their medical degree . hefin david am : nick brazil , the deputy principal of gower college , said about 50 per cent of the russell group do n't value the welsh bac . kirsty williams am : well , i do n't know where he 's getting that from . i have made it a personal commitment to establish this with universities . i have visited both cambridge and oxford . i spoke again to cambridge , oxford , bath , southampton , st andrews , only last week , who were exhibiting at the seren conference . i specifically took the opportunity to meet with those universities and to talk to them about how they feel about the welsh bac . they have a high regard for the welsh baccalaureate in a variety of ways . first of all , for many of those universities , for many of their courses , they use the welsh bac as an equivalent to an a-level . if they do n't , there are some courses , for instance , where they will lower their offer to gain a place at that university if the welsh bac is passed at a certain level . so , for instance , rather than maybe offering a welsh student a , a , b , they would offer a welsh student a , b , b , plus a welsh bac , thus giving students two opportunities to gain a place at that university , either with or without their welsh bac qualification . even for those universities that do n't use the welsh baccalaureate as a formal part of their offer\u2014and this is the conversation i had again last week with oxford and cambridge\u2014they value it as part of a student 's personal statement ; they value it as part of the interview process in which a student may or may not then be offered a place at that university ; and they also recognise that the skills learnt by students whilst undertaking the welsh baccalaureate are exactly the skills that those students need to make a successful transition from a-level work to university-type work , which , if you can imagine , is very much based on individual research and being able to guide your own learning . so , i just do n't recognise that in some way welsh students are being disadvantaged . the message i get consistently from universities is that there are significant advantages to welsh learners taking this qualification . hefin david am : okay . you can not recognise it , but that is contrary to the evidence that we 've received . i 'm not saying that the evidence is conclusive , but it actually demonstrates inconsistency . so , would you go so far as to accept instead then that there is an inconsistency in the way that universities use the welsh bac as a tool for application ? kirsty williams am : you would know better than anybody , hefin , that universities are autonomous institutions and they set their own methods of entry into those institutions . what i 'm telling you is that the evidence that i have received from universities is that , whilst there is a variety of approaches to how they regard the qualification in terms of offers , consistently , absolutely across the board , all universities tell me that the welsh baccalaureate is a valuable qualification and does not disadvantage welsh students . hefin david am : if the committee were to produce a report based on the evidence we 've received , that would be contrary to what you 've just said . so , i think we 'd end up in a debate in which we are setting out different points of view . so , would you therefore commit to exploring that perspective ? kirsty williams am : hefin , i would argue that i have indeed explored that perspective because i have taken the trouble to find out first-hand\u2014not via my officials , but first-hand\u2014from those institutions , their views . so , this is not something that is hearsay ; i have undertaken to ascertain the views of those universities . we have written to all vice-chancellors\u2014last year\u2014with regard to the welsh baccalaureate qualification . qualifications wales has an individual whose specific job it is to ensure that universities across the united kingdom understand the value of welsh qualifications . that will become increasingly important as we see a divergence between english and welsh qualifications . but i have to say that the evidence that i have from universities is that the welsh baccalaureate , whilst it may be used in different ways in terms of an offer , the consistency from all universities is that it is a valuable qualification . if you 've heard differently from admissions tutors and from the universities officially , rather than from somebody who has e-mailed in , then i would be pleased to look at that evidence , because it would be in stark contrast to what i am being told by universities . lynne neagle am : hefin is not referring to an e-mail\u2014 hefin david am : no , i 've said that . lynne neagle am : \u2014we did do a survey and we 've also taken oral evidence . hefin david am : yes , and it 's representing the evidence that we received . kirsty williams am : and i 'm presenting you with the evidence that i 've received . hefin david am : but it will be presented to you as a submission from this committee , no doubt . let 's look at some admissions offers instead then . you do concede that there is inconsistency with how admissions offers are made with regard to the skills challenge certificate . how would you suggest that that is addressed ? kirsty williams am : hefin , each individual institution and university the length and breadth of the uk have different ways in which they make offers to individuals . what is absolutely clear to me , and if the concern is around the type of institution\u2014 . so , for instance , it is accepted as a third-grade offer in bristol , edinburgh , exeter , lancaster , leeds , leicester , liverpool , the london school of economics\u2014some of the highest performing universities and russell group universities . it is accepted as a fourth qualification or amends the offer in places like bath university , and it is accepted in tariff-point offers in places like hull and the university of the west of england . so there is a variety of ways in which universities use the qualification , and that is their prerogative\u2014that 's their prerogative as institutions . they will have different ways in which they recruit and how they offer places , just like different universities will have different views on unconditional offers . you know , there 's a difference in universities there , is n't there ? some universities do n't have unconditional offers at all ; other universities\u2014 hefin david am : so , what you 're saying is that the problem is n't connected to the welsh bac , it 's connected with just the way that universities make offers , and the welsh bac has got nothing to do with it . kirsty williams am : i \u2019 m saying there is a variety . just like any other qualification , there is a variety in how universities use qualifications for offers . what i \u2019 m saying to you is that , in the conversations that i have had with russell group universities , what they say is that there is certainly no detriment to any welsh student undertaking this qualification . they value the qualification . they think it is useful . it develops a set of skills that help students to make that transition into higher education . and therefore , i think it is a myth\u2014i would go as far as to say that it \u2019 s a myth\u2014that welsh students are disadvantaged in any way by taking this qualification . sorry , andrew . andrew clark : could i just add to that response ? there are , obviously , differences in the way that universities treat the skills challenge certificate and the welsh baccalaureate , which is the prime focus of this . the attitude of the universities has changed significantly since that was a graded qualification . kirsty williams am : yes , that has made a difference . andrew clark : and even those who do not make it part of their offer consider it exceedingly valuable in the way that young people are prepared to go to university and , therefore , as part of their personal statement , as part of their interview , the activity that the young person has taken by means of the skills challenge certificate is definitely recognised , even by those who don \u2019 t actually make it part of their offer . so , we \u2019 re still on a journey\u2014that graded qualification has only been taught for a couple of years , but the journey is taking us to the right place , towards the right destination . hefin david am : okay . so , it isn \u2019 t just about variable admissions practices across universities ; it is to deal with the skills challenge certificate as well , which needed changing in order to improve that . andrew clark : but that was changed in september 2015 . when it was a 'yes'/'no ' qualification , i think they held it in less regard than they do now that it is a graded qualification . kirsty williams am : and that \u2019 s the conversation we had with some of our russell group universities . andrew clark : and that was an important shift three years ago . hefin david am : okay . so , last question , then : are you absolutely confident that any concerns we are offering are nothing really to worry about ?"
