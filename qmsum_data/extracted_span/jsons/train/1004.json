    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about functional features to include in the remote .",
    "answer": "industrial designer : in fact i have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . the push button are usually extremely cheap , but i just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . project manager : okay . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and i think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . project manager : okay . industrial designer : uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . user interface : yeah . project manager : but is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? because we can afford up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control . industrial designer : yeah . yeah project manager : so will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve euros to produce ? industrial designer : i i th but i do n't think that uh we should we should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . user interface : yeah . also have to say industrial designer : but user interface : did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? industrial designer : um that 's all project manager : you received something industrial designer : yeah . i have n't chec user interface : yeah . you we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . says yeah . it says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . but i guess it could be project manager : and could it be adapted ? user interface : i guess it 's possible . i mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command . project manager : okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ? user interface : yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip project manager : okay . yeah . user interface : then we we could use it . project manager : okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah but i think it 's yeah sorry , i have n't written my personal references . um the i i just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , project manager : okay . industrial designer : and if we could reduce that . we we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . user interface : mm-hmm . i have a question about that actually . um , what is the purpose of the light ? industrial designer : just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber user interface : is project manager : you can easily find the button in the dark or so ? user interface : but but in th in the dark uh yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? project manager : it will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control i think , no ? user interface : but if you move it then you have it , you do n't need to find it . you can see the buttons better , of course . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . true . industrial designer : yeah . actually . user interface : but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . industrial designer : as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . user interface : yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ? industrial designer : yeah . again . user interface : yeah no it 's too expensive . industrial designer : i do n't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be user interface : okay . mm . extra . yeah , okay . mm . yeah , but i expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , industrial designer : first of all i was thinking to have a a continuous light user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device user interface : mm . mm-hmm . project manager : but it can be uh battery consuming , no ? to have the light always on ? industrial designer : yeah , a little bit . a little bit . project manager : well we will discuss that after maybe industrial designer : yeah . project manager : the other presentations . user interface : . so uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder . project manager : yeah . user interface : so . it was last time i saw it . project manager : and it is . user interface : okay . so , project manager : okay . user interface : just move to the next slide . so basically want very simple , right ? that 's the major idea , as simple as possible . project manager : yeah . yeah ."
