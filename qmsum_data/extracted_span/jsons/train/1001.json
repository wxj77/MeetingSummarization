    "answer": "user interface : mm . uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . so um uh you 'cause uh yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . project manager : yeah . change the cases . yeah . user interface : maybe it 's possible uh possibility . so um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh project manager : you can sell the cases . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . i think that 's a very good option . because um then you can advertise as well with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : because that 's a it 's something extra , it 's something other remotes do n't have , user interface : yeah . project manager : which we can get a great advantage point . marketing : yeah that is true . project manager : so and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as well . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . we would have to look carefully into the design though . project manager : costs . marketing : 'cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . the more original one , or the more standard one . project manager : yeah . yeah . so marketing : so that would project manager : you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . marketing : well i would n't design a telephone industrial designer : marketing : but user interface : marketing : well no i think w we should just , we should then just design one um project manager : remote . marketing : one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . project manager : yeah . okay . marketing : so , but that should n't be too much of a problem . project manager : so everybody 's okay with the changing covers ? i think that 's a good uh good option . user interface : yeah . project manager : changing case covers . marketing : um i heard our industrial designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . project manager : yeah . marketing : could you explain that a little more ? industrial designer : well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . marketing : and what would single curved and double curved mean ? industrial designer : um it would just only affect the form , for as far as i know . so it 's j really just up to the design department what we 're gon na use . it does n't really matter for the price or the functionality . marketing : okay . so we can pretty much just do whatever we want . industrial designer : pick one you like , yes . project manager : mm . okay . marketing : 'kay . that 's good . project manager : uh but the form has to be um it has to it 's has to be possible to stand up ? or just only to lie down ? marketing : no just to lie down . user interface : okay . project manager : and the the cover of the the docking station is also marketing : we 'll go for that . project manager : on top of the television then ? or not ? marketing : well or besides it . project manager : and you can just yeah then click it in . that 's okay . um so the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ? um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : on the the board . does somebody have ideas for a form or user interface : uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it 's um not quite uh fancy . so um yeah . marketing : um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , user interface : yeah . marketing : so you could , so your thumb would be easily user interface : yeah . marketing : well uh i think that was a very good point 'cause i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause r_s_i_ . so that would be great for that . um i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . user interface : for uh uh for marketing : for left-handed users also . user interface : yeah yeah . mm . yeah we is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? and on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? or or is n't it ? marketing : for the volume . um well that could yeah we could do that but i 'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . project manager : usabili yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , user interface : yeah okay . project manager : and then it 's marketing : but if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . 'cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . project manager : but you have extra buttons . user interface : but project manager : so people can get confused . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : that is true . user interface : yeah . project manager : especially if they have the same writings on it . user interface : see um yeah . or we have to make a left uh for lefties project manager : ca n't we make uh ca n't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same user interface : and um project manager : functions as the normal one ?"
