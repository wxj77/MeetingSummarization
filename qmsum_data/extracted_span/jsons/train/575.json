    "query": "<s> what did the meeting discuss about the impact on particular children with intense need ?",
    "answer": "dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . just following on from your answer to si\u00e2n gwenllian earlier about the number of vulnerable children in school , what 's being done specifically to facilitate more of those children coming into a school setting or hub at the moment ? i 'm thinking about the 600 you 've talked about , and i know , in one of my local authority areas of merthyr , which is a very small authority , we 're talking about the number of children identified as vulnerable running into thousands , not hundreds , and that 's just in one authority . so , this is a particularly difficult issue to address , i appreciate , but how are we going to get more of these children into the hubs ? kirsty williams am : okay , dawn . the first thing to say is that the issue of vulnerable children attending settings is one that is a challenge to not just wales , but also to my colleagues in northern ireland , scotland and england . i 'm pleased to say that we are working across government departments\u2014myself , obviously , and colleagues in education\u2014with colleagues in social services to have a cross-government approach to these issues . i think the first thing to say is that these are complex messages , because the overriding public health message from our government has been to stay at home and children should be kept at home as much as possible , and to make sure that our hubs run smoothly , safely and effectively , we do need to limit the number of children who are attending those hubs . so , firstly , the fact that numbers are small is in some ways a success of our public health messages , because parents have been heeding those messages , but , of course , all of us will have concerns for some children who remain at home . so , i 'm pleased to say that we have seen a doubling in the last week of the number of children . so , although numbers are small , they have doubled over the course of the last week . we 're working with local authorities and they have assured us that children and young people with a social worker have been risk assessed on a multi-agency basis and are receiving support in a number of ways , and that includes having conversations about some of those children attending the hubs . they 're also looking to support in other ways . of course , some of our children who would be classed as vulnerable\u2014and our definition of 'vulnerable ' is one that is shared between the systems in england and wales\u2014could be children with a statement of special educational needs . for some of those children who , perhaps , have very intense health needs , actually , staying at home is the appropriate thing for that child and that family to do , and we 're looking to support families , and local authorities and local education systems are looking to support families , in a number of ways . we also know that just because you do n't have a social worker or a statement of special educational needs does not mean that a child may not be vulnerable , and schools are very aware of the needs of those children and have been carrying out regular telephone check-ins where they can\u2014if the age of the child is appropriate\u2014just to keep in touch with those families and those individual children . but we will continue to work across government to encourage , where it is appropriate , children to attend settings , and , if it is not appropriate for children to be in a setting , that there is contact with those children and young people to ensure that they remain , and their families remain , supported . dawn bowden am : thank you , minister . it 's encouraging to hear you talk about the ongoing safeguarding of children that are at home and i assume , within that , appropriate referral mechanisms are still in place if teachers or anybody has any particular concern about a child . similarly , with special educational needs , whereas some of those children benefit clearly from a one-to-one provision in a school , and they may not respond as well to remote working , or remote contact , with an sen advisor , are you considering in any way any relaxation of the lockdown rule in particular for those children in terms of them being able to access the support that they need for their particular educational needs ? kirsty williams am : well , first of all , dawn , you 're absolutely right : my expectation is that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children , and schools should continue to refer children to children 's services if they have any concerns , and that would also , of course , be the case for youth workers who may be keeping in contact with children . so , there is a professional expectation on all those that are working with our children and young people that , despite the circumstances they find themselves in , they should continue to report and refer cases if they see anything or hear or are told anything that makes them concerned about a child 's welfare and safety . with regard to children with additional learning needs , i am aware that that can present a number of challenges to families and children , and perhaps steve davies could give some further details . we have been keen to work with local authorities to ensure specialist provision , where that is appropriate\u2014so , if i could give you an example of my own local authority in powys , they have two specialist centres available for children with more profound additional learning needs , and those centres are available\u2014recognising , however , that , even with the provision of specialist hubs , it can be a challenge for some children with additional learning needs to find themselves outside of a routine . hubs are often staffed on a rota basis and therefore children could be faced with staff that they are unfamiliar with . so , even when local authorities\u2014and the vast , vast majority of them do\u2014have specialist services in place , sometimes that might not be the best thing for a child 's health and well-being . but perhaps steve can give us further details of the conversations that have been taking place with directors of education to ensure that children with additional learning needs have access to the hubs and specialist support . steve ."
