marketing : yeah . project manager : marketing : okay . i i const i constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . and each criteria is will be evaluated it 's uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if it 's true or is or if it 's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven . industrial designer : why this strange factor of seven ? marketing : because i i 'm sorry . sorry . industrial designer : usually i have seen that scales are from one to ten . marketing : ah yeah . it 's from sorry , it 's from one to seven . it 's from from one to seven sorry . because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale , industrial designer : okay . project manager : num number industrial designer : okay . mm-hmm . marketing : and five is too short and nine is too long . industrial designer : okay . marketing : i 'm a i i 'm industrial designer : okay fine , got the idea . project manager : so to have in order to have enough granularity marketing : sorry ?

user interface : industrial designer : again i 'll give seven . project manager : seven . user interface : i 'd give it a six like i 'd i think it 's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote . project manager : so seven , seven , industrial designer : seven for me . user interface : yeah . project manager : six point five . functional . user interface : industrial designer : i 'll give five . project manager : four . marketing : i would say project manager : user interface : well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ? marketing : everything ar project manager : uh for a remote control , does he have all the user interface : you know . marketing : mm everything user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : you could expect . marketing : it 's compared to the all industrial designer : that 's right . marketing : remote controls . user interface : that 's before industrial designer : that 's right . the standards . what is available in the market off the shelf . user interface : yeah . i have to say four . marketing : actually i do n't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro user interface : well it 's not a universal remote . remember we 're focus we 're supposed to focus just on tvs . industrial designer : we marketing : ah it 's not an univer but it 's for all kind of tvs ?

it 's more targeting u_k_ or marketing : i do n't know . wha the initial specifications were for the whole all europe or user interface : uh project manager : so this is selling costs , not production costs . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah this is the the initial specifications . project manager : yeah yeah sure . um five . marketing : i would say six . it 's quite cheap actually . user interface : i 'd say two . project manager : aw , should be nice in your user interface : i do n't want a banana on my living room table , a banana remote . industrial designer : no but it 's really handy actually if you see . user interface : it is handy , it 's handy , but it it 's terrible . industrial designer : it 's it 's so handy . and then project manager : it 's kitsch . industrial designer : anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he 'll at least ask once what is this . user interface : yeah . yeah , but it 's not a positive thing . industrial designer : it 's a very positive thing if you see like that . user interface : well , you know , it 's it 's handy , it 's ergonomic , but it 's a banana . project manager : well , do n't forget well , do n't for do n't forget who we 're targeting also who are f f who are wh industrial designer : youngsters . project manager : yeah , youngst youngst user interface : yeah but it says i , i would buy this , so . marketing : actually maybe project manager : no well yeah i if you would be young . marketing : yeah project manager : not telling that you are young . li li like a teenager for instance . user interface : no , it 's i . i would buy industrial designer : project manager : okay you 're you 're crazy teenager and you like fun things . industrial designer : you want to flaunt . project manager : yeah . user interface : industrial designer : you with your girlfriend or something . project manager : yeah , you want to show the beautiful banana you have . industrial designer : or might be it does some other kind of thing but user interface : still i i 'd say two . i do n't think i at any stage in my life i would want a banana remote control , really . industrial designer : uh yeah , crazy . project manager : okay so you s you give user interface : i can say , maybe there is a market for it , i dunno . project manager : oh yeah yeah i know i know . industrial designer : project manager : so you say two . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i say five . project manager : f i d i say five . you say ? marketing : i change the question . project manager : so what 's the new question ? industrial designer : and you have saved it ? marketing : so yeah upload the industrial designer : you 'll have to reload . project manager : uh yeah , i think so . user interface : okay , so , it depends if uh marketing : yeah it 's two different situations . if you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one . project manager : yeah that 's two different question . user interface : if i had t if i had to spend twenty five euro , if that was like my limit , maybe i would buy it . because the other twenty five euro remote controls are probably gon na look project manager : ugly . user interface : worse than a banana . industrial designer : they 're not going to be as and they they might not be a as easy as this marketing : user interface : and it yeah this is gon na f you know handy to use . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : so ?

six ? project manager : so we are six , five , four industrial designer : six , five , four . marketing : six , so it 's uh five point five , or less . project manager : yeah . so industrial designer : okay . project manager : so and last question , will i change my rem change my remote control from mando banana . um , zero . no uh we ca n't . marketing : project manager : so one . user interface : marketing : actually yeah , i we project manager : well if . user interface : yeah . project manager : no uh let 's say i 'll put two . user interface : i 'd say three , i mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible . if it was change my remote control of my d_v_d_ player for a mando banana then i would be more inclined to project manager : it 's for the tv . user interface : but uh 'cause it 's really bad but uh marketing : user interface : i 'd say a three . industrial designer : i 'll still give it five . yeah . marketing : five ? project manager : two three five two three fi and two . marketing : you are romantic , really . industrial designer : so it 's somewhere three point five i think . marketing : i would say two . project manager : so it 's r yeah , three point five . marketing : who is the outlier ?
