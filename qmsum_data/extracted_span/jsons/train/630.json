    "query": "<s> what did gareth pierce think of the translation of materials between the two languages ?",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : thank you . we heard in the video that teachers are spending a lot of their time actually translating materials . what is your view on that as a good use of teachers ' time in wales ? gareth pierce : i think the question of translation is an interesting one . there was talk about pupils translating and teachers translating . i think perhaps we need to understand what causes the need for that because , as i mentioned earlier , there are so many resources available digitally in both languages at the same time . perhaps an interesting question is : is that source useful for teachers , being able to draw resources from two sources ? another interesting question , i think , is\u2014 . the welsh language , of course , is a language that is used in an educational context , but we are in a big world that 's an english language world . i 'm very aware that many of the websites we refer to in our resources and many of the case studies , as was mentioned in that video\u2014they are available in english only . therefore , i think another interesting question is : can we discover what those additional resources are that are worth translating ? and , certainly , it would be very unfortunate if there were a dozen welsh-medium schools , for example , translating material from the same website independently of each other . if there are a few websites , or a few case studies , in this big external digital world that are worth translating , should n't we able to source those early ? because i do n't think it 's a good use of teachers ' time . but i also think that the use of both languages is an interesting one . what is the vision in terms of teaching in a welsh-medium class , in particular , perhaps , in the a-level classes ? i 'm sure that some teachers feel that there is a way of enriching the teaching by referring to terms in both languages , as well as explaining those terms in their own language . but the impression i got from the video was that there was quite a lot of mechanical translating happening , and perhaps there is a need to understand more of the context . lynne neagle am : llyr on this . llyr gruffydd am : just to pick up on your point on the additional materials , whose role would it be to asses this or to take that overview , and then to respond to the demand ? gareth pierce : mike , in the wjec , has conversations about resources in the team he 's part of ."
