    "answer": "user interface : uh yeah . okay . okay . so i am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . i think uh i think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . so , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . and uh s uh i can conclude like this , that we should n't need to learn how to use it . it should be we should n't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control . okay . so what i found out that uh as i said uh i think it 's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand . it should not be completely like uh a cube . it should be it should have round edge , so uh then it 's easier . industrial designer : exactly . user interface : and maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . and uh also f uh uh m because because customers does n't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy . okay . and my personal p uh preference is uh , as i said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . and if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . uh . and also uh i think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . not on remote control . i dunno if i can explain well . but uh just inside . for example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . so it can be another uh preference . and uh i dunno but uh i think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . i know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . and i think it 's good because it 's something new and usually young people like something new . so it may not be very useful but because it 's new , people may buy it . uh i personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or . okay . that 's mine . project manager : okay . industrial designer : uh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from hamed , but bad news from bob obviously , because spongy design , i do n't like it as marketing : project manager : industrial designer : okay , so could you please , fabien , open it . project manager : yeah . marketing : industrial designer : i 'm person two . and which one , uh probably the first one . i 'm not sure but check the first one . i most of the things i have to write myself on the board , but project manager : this one , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , that 's it . just it 's only this slide ? yeah . this this is just uh one thing i wanted to mention and show you that i just uh i just found this , that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or i 'll just marketing : inch . industrial designer : yeah , seven seven inch t_ t_f_t_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . uh so i i probably draw it down raw scheme . project manager : oh , . industrial designer : this is this is the stuff that i can use to"
