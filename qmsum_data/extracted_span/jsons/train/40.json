project manager : you did work together did n't you ? industrial designer : yeah we will yeah , so i will be able to to summarize uh our meeting , but still i think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . i think we can put on the here . project manager : yes . yes . industrial designer : uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items . project manager : mm . um yes industrial designer : um , can we have a phone , project manager : but w we industrial designer : can someone project manager : yes , maybe we should phone him . um well um , industrial designer : it 's really w well designed . marketing : mm . mm , object tracking . project manager : when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . um so just for record i i will take uh notes again . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : and um well first thing uh i was uh uh i got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve euro and fifty cents . industrial designer : 'kay . project manager : when you stay in it 's good , when you do n't stay in you have to redesign . there is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter . so we have to consider that . good . um so maybe anna , you can have your presentation . marketing : well we ca n't no we ca n't do evaluation 'til we have a design . project manager : okay matthew . nice uh you are here . industrial designer : great . project manager : great . great . oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs . industrial designer : yep . so i will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight euros actually , right , seven eight euros , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it 's like a surf board . marketing : mm 'kay . industrial designer : and you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf tv , maybe the web , and uh it 's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff . marketing : project manager : user interface : project manager : user interface : or browse . industrial designer : and also it 's not too far from um a mobile . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so people are used to that kind of shape , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : right . do n't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we do n't take user interface : now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . industrial designer : yeah . so here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i yeah . industrial designer : yeah l_a_ l_a_ l_e_d_ , user interface : l_e_d_ . industrial designer : the on-off button , in red . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : here would be the volume . on the on the left , marketing : oh yeah . project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : okay , so user interface : mm-hmm , hmm . industrial designer : easy to turn on t and off . and um so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh matthew . user interface : also so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : so you can go up and down the channels , marketing : yeah . user interface : uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . industrial designer : how can you change from v_c_r_ to uh tv , by the way ? user interface : oh no no no , this is a single this this is a model with just the tv one . industrial designer : okay yeah . yeah yeah . project manager : ah , okay . user interface : no no just sorry , this is a standard tv one , we are not talking about that . so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : the extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . and the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . actually . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay so project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : it 's it 's t a very basic remote then , it 's only user interface : it 's a very basic minimal thing project manager : yeah . yeah . yeah . user interface : which you can which is which is also available in the market , actually that 's what it that it i industrial designer : user interface : and would cost us to build it about eight euros . industrial designer : seven , eight , ei eight euros . project manager : exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so this one model marketing : can i see ? user interface : and uh yeah . sure . marketing : thanks . okay i like the volume control , that 's good . industrial designer : user interface : th this is a magic one but i know we do n't want to talk about that , marketing : user interface : you know like industrial designer : user interface : uh i i i it is a very futuristic , it 's like uh it 's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . project manager : marketing : uh-huh . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : marketing : so it does n't actually have buttons . user interface : so that uh then what we look t marketing : did you wan na see ? user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah no you can carry on , user interface : this is a model , project manager : i just look how it feels all . user interface : yeah . project manager : yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : just i 'm industrial designer : yeah actually , yeah . project manager : i really want to talk to it . marketing : it wo n't talk back . project manager : but . industrial designer : project manager : so but but continue with your uh user interface : uh so well project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys , but do n't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . marketing : right . user interface : and so they have more space actually marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and uh it 's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo industrial designer : play , pause . user interface : yeah s pause or stop , and uh then uh you can uh you have a lcd display , here project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it 's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it project manager : from d_v_d_ player to television or something . industrial designer : exactly yeah . to audio and to video on demand . user interface : yeah . i really can change it , so instead of having many switches , y marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yes and and and then you get feedback via the lcd yeah . user interface : the lcd can display what is that on that , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here , industrial designer : this is the orange button , the microphone . user interface : or in the button th here , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . industrial designer : an yeah . user interface : and here is a small l_e_d_ which is like blinking one , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as i was talking earlier project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : okay . and uh well then we have a cover basically , basically you do n't need much of the time this , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover project manager : mm . yeah industrial designer : crazy dis designer , user interface : you know . industrial designer : okay . user interface : design enter . project manager : but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the lcd screen ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah yeah . user interface : yeah . it 's basically to do that . project manager : but but the lcd screen i mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature industrial designer : yeah . user interface : project manager : which should n't be should n't be user interface : actually when you are watching the tv , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , industrial designer : oh actually well . project manager : that th that 's true . user interface : you know , uh you want to uh and this gives a protection to the lcd actually , giving a cover to that actually . gives a protection because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . yes . yes , more robust . user interface : it 's more robust that way . uh yeah . project manager : yes okay . user interface : and you have very good chances industrial designer : it 's low weight . you have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so the the cost is actually a bit more , it 's uh it 's it 's sixteen francs . user interface : it sixteen euros . project manager : okay . industrial designer : sixteen euros sorry . marketing : so it 's well outside the budget then . user interface : industrial designer : then it 's out of budget . but the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . and they say basically that the s_r_ system would be uh something like three francs per item user interface : yeah . three euros . industrial designer : three euros sorry . and um marketing : that 's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ? industrial designer : no no no , part of that , yeah . user interface : part of that . marketing : so that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . project manager : mm 'kay . hmm . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : well i think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : it 's too user interface : it it should not be cluttering up everything . marketing : what 's this one on the side ? user interface : ah that 's for the it 's kind of a l_e_d_ for indicating your battery industrial designer : locati . location . marketing : ah okay . user interface : and as well as it 's like a blinking one marketing : mm-hmm . mm 'kay . user interface : you know industrial designer : yeah . user interface : you can keep it aside . marketing : i like the shape of them , i do like the the size and the the shape . project manager : well well mm . user interface : yeah . project manager : be before ta talking about the money and what 's possible and what is not possible , maybe anna you can uh give our uh give us your um marketing : mm-hmm . okay . and maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . project manager : yes . evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at . marketing : okay . basically this is what we 've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : we just wan na make sure that we 've taken into account project manager : just do it quickly if if we al already . marketing : so it 's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we 've identified as being important to selling the product . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we 'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so these are the things we identified as being important . um the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . and then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . so well do you wan na go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wan na discuss them further and then evaluate them ? project manager : um , n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now , marketing : okay . so f just go through onto the whiteboard i guess . not sure how this is gon na come out . so the first one was really very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ? 'cause if we 're only going to make it for eight euros then we have a project manager : mm , well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight euros we must think how can we improve it . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and then i mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half euro marketing : mm-hmm . yep . project manager : and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five euros industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five euro . industrial designer : functionality . marketing : okay so look and feel , innovation user interface : and now it easy to use . marketing : industrial designer : easy to use . target . marketing : mm-hmm . and trends . oh , you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? is that part of both of them or ? project manager : um well w w we can still discuss that . marketing : okay . project manager : so um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but um i 've received uh a framework which we can do this . i mean did you have this this excel sheet ? marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : no okay , this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , industrial designer : project manager : so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve euro uh fifty cents uh . marketing : mm-hmm . okay . project manager : so maybe we can start with this , uh , calling this one . marketing : okay . yep . so it 's the pink . project manager : th th this is the first design . marketing : and the other one 's green . okay , so look and feel ? where um one is i 've broken the pen again . s project manager : uh there is another pen . marketing : yeah . get that one . um w one 's bad and seven 's the best . sorry , one 's true and seven 's false . one 's the best . project manager : okay . marketing : so on a scale of one to seven ? project manager : 'kay . okay . so . look and feel . well you already feel that uh pretty much i think . user interface : project manager : in i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm , yeah . mm-hmm . project manager : so i i i would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but that 's just half , we should also consider look , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and then i it looks quite conventional . do n't you agree ? user interface : mm yeah . marketing : on the scale u it 's between functional and fancy basically we 're looking at , project manager : so maybe two . hmm . hmm . ma ma ma ma maybe say say five marketing : so project manager : i it 's my opinion , but i do n't know what what user interface : well i will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it 's like the surf as you say marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : you know . it though the look is fine but uh still i will give four in that case industrial designer : yeah . four maybe . user interface : you know . marketing : four ? okay . project manager : four , four . user interface : four yeah project manager : now we th th user interface : that marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : then we settle on four . user interface : yeah . i will gi yeah . project manager : 'kay . can you maybe fix the other industrial designer : uh . yeah . if you press like this not like this then you marketing : no that 's the ink 's dried . user interface : c can you get the batteries ? no no the battery has fallen down , marketing : battery 's low , is n't it the ink ? user interface : that 's i marketing : the b that 's the that that one ? user interface : yeah . marketing : battery there . industrial designer : but user interface : no no it 's not that , it 's how to close a battery . industrial designer : okay . user interface : okay ? now it should be . marketing : mm . no i think it 's lost a battery . project manager : mm , try it , just try it . marketing : no it 's it would still write project manager : oh it will not marketing : but it would n't pick it up with the sensors . project manager : ri mm , mm . user interface : is there another battery there ? oh yeah . marketing : you got a second ? industrial designer : try a marketing : well we wo n't be able to tell . project manager : yes , it it has a mm . user interface : industrial designer : perfect . marketing : is that working ? industrial designer : marketing : did it come out ? good . okay . project manager : good . good . marketing : because we 'll be able to see it still even if it was n't working , it 's just a normal whiteboard marker industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : but it would n't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard . project manager : okay . so then then marketing : and the other one ? user interface : marketing : i think it 's slightly better , um , project manager : ah . mm . marketing : it 's hard to tell from just the plasticine , project manager : i i i marketing : but project manager : when we want to include i i i 'm doubting about this this component . it it it it breaks in your industrial designer : maybe user interface : no actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , marketing : okay . user interface : it it 's n i it is jus industrial designer : it 's not a button it 's a led , it 's a user interface : it 's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve industrial designer : ac actually yeah it should be embedded . project manager : mm , yes i see , mm okay . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . user interface : it 's will be embedded there industrial designer : yeah . oh user interface : so it wo n't be really you know protruding or something . industrial designer : you can push push it again , you can push it . marketing : yeah . the other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? user interface : yeah . marketing : 'cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : maybe it wo n't work so well . user interface : no you it it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that marketing : okay . project manager : well r r marketing : i 'd say two or three for that one , personally . probably more towards three than two . project manager : i think the look is better industrial designer : project manager : but the feel is is is worse . so so i would also say this is four . marketing : okay . project manager : but w w do you what do you think ? user interface : uh it 's fine i think . my just that um the feel is that um you right now you you do n't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it 's embedded one . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm . mm . yes . user interface : this is how embedded one will project manager : yes , it basically is the same shape . user interface : yeah . it 's a bas basically the same thing actually . project manager : mm-hmm . mm . user interface : you will be except that in this c industrial designer : and the lcd makes it better . yeah . user interface : yeah project manager : yeah . yeah . yeah . user interface : and you might have a slight thing for to forward and marketing : mm , okay . yeah industrial designer : so i will say two . marketing : it 's d it 's definitely more fancier than that one . project manager : yes , okay . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : i would say two , three . marketing : okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : so , consensus ? two or three ? project manager : mm . two 's good user interface : looking like marketing : um , 'kay . innovation . the first one , not really muc industrial designer : basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , marketing : mm . yeah . industrial designer : right ? marketing : do we user interface : no but except for the design of the surf . industrial designer : yeah . the surf uh design . marketing : what what features are we actually including ? user interface : you should be rea marketing : are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? user interface : uh no marketing : there 's nothing like that ? user interface : i think it 's more of the feel . marketing : but th is there any there 's no actual innovation in that at all , it 's just a straight-out remote control . user interface : yeah , yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : the only innova innovation is the shape . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : say about that . marketing : okay . project manager : s so that marketing : so there 's no this uh look and feel thing , though that 's not a technological innovation . industrial designer : yeah . you 're right . user interface : yeah . marketing : so i 'd be up for seven for innovation . industrial designer : yeah . and the and the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . and um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part . user interface : yeah , it gives it project manager : yes . a and the lcd screen is industrial designer : yeah . project manager : that 's that 's that 's well it 's quite innovative . industrial designer : and all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . uh could put it at one or two i would say . personally . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah . mm . mm . mm . mm . marketing : so what is it , what are the innovations with this ? got the lcd screen . industrial designer : uh yeah automatic speech recognition . marketing : is that in this one though ? is this 'cause this is the th th there were different options we discussed then , user interface : no , we ha marketing : we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . project manager : we just diske discuss it as you designed it marketing : okay . project manager : and then we will will try to get it in the budget . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so the cost for these were industrial designer : so marketing : what was the cost for the first one ? eight euros ? project manager : eight . industrial designer : eight . well actually we have yeah to check again yeah . user interface : yeah , eight euros yeah . marketing : and this one was sixteen euros . industrial designer : sixteen . user interface : sixteen euros . marketing : okay . so . innovation for this one is two ? one ? user interface : it 's a two , i would say two . industrial designer : w w un to be one what would do we nee actually , yeah , i do n't see project manager : why it is one . industrial designer : okay , one would would be without buttons , . project manager : user interface : project manager : a man w w marketing : mm . well user interface : yeah . marketing : the speech recognition is a very good innovation i believe it , so industrial designer : yeah . so maybe we can put one . project manager : this this is it w with the speech recognition ? industrial designer : it 's using speech recognition , yeah . project manager : well . user interface : okay yeah . project manager : gi given that that it works , marketing : give it a one ? industrial designer : yeah , one , yeah . project manager : then it 's i think one . marketing : okay . ease of use ? user interface : uh industrial designer : so the first one is really standard , so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , user interface : he is used to it act marketing : yeah . industrial designer : right ? user interface : they are used to it actually . marketing : yep . so that 's maybe a a two for ease of use . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : here there may industrial designer : um , the other one is quite easy , tho though . user interface : uh , though it has more functionality i think it should n't be for the user to learn it actually . it should n't be diffi marketing : okay . so maybe a three or a four . user interface : uh yeah , actually in fact i think it will be industrial designer : one me um we hope user interface : yeah industrial designer : maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . user interface : yeah but y industrial designer : and there is a like i would say three . or maybe four . marketing : okay . consensus ? three or four ? user interface : well we have reduced the keys actually you see . project manager : three , i would . three . marketing : three ? okay . industrial designer : yeah , yeah user interface : three is fine with me . industrial designer : because it 's n uh it 's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so , user interface : yeah it 's a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : it 's not so easy , like this one the normal . project manager : yeah . yes but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy . user interface : is quite easy yeah . project manager : so so i think th three is good . yeah . user interface : initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : good . marketing : so three 's project manager : what 's the next ? marketing : uh how well it goes to the target demographic . so we 're d we 're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? project manager : so twe twenty to forty , yes that 's marketing : that 's industrial designer : this one would be uh for grandmothers . project manager : user interface : oh no , this would i i would i would give this model to the old people actually . industrial designer : yeah , grandmothers , yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so sh completely changed our demographic there , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and marketing : it 's not part of the the funky young thing . project manager : well exce except for the surfing shape . i mean that 's that 's something which which has an appeal on this group i think , industrial designer : yeah that 's true . yeah . marketing : yeah . if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then i can imagine it being applying to the the demographic project manager : but industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . that 's it 's still ye project manager : mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic marketing : mm . 'cause we have got room , we 've got some budget there to add a few things to it , that 's right . project manager : but as it is now , i w would say mm , six , something . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : oh yeah , . marketing : and project manager : do you agree ? user interface : i industrial designer : yeah because it 's so important it 's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets , the right range of people , user interface : well i think industrial designer : right ? user interface : yeah . uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it 's going to be cheap , actually . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but it 's going to be cheap whatever though , user interface : so marketing : it was set with i we 've got a set price . user interface : and people can still decide to use the cheaper one industrial designer : yeah . user interface : instead of a industrial designer : but for us it 's yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five euros . project manager : mm , yeah , indeed . marketing : yeah . there 's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few euros on that one rather than another one . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : ju just think , twenty five euros , i mean it 's not going to be cheaper . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : okay . so in that case well it 's fine then . marketing : okay . um project manager : mm . mm . okay . user interface : we can yeah . marketing : and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? user interface : and the demographics of marketing : it 's got the got the the toys in it , it 's got the lcd screen project manager : yeah tha tha tha tha tha that 's marketing : and project manager : i think it 's better , because of the lcd screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the marketing : yeah . project manager : on the and on the industrial designer : yeah . and if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , i think for this audience we need absolutely the lcd screen . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm . so , the lcd screen uh attracts , marketing : yeah . i think especially if we 're gon na n have an lcd screen on a low range product then that 's good . project manager : because it mm , ma maybe that 's something to consider , yes , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm . okay . project manager : so . wh what what marketing : i 'd probably go with three again for that one . user interface : yeah i think it 's uh it has more market actually . industrial designer : or even even one and two . or two . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : no s say t two . user interface : y yeah , you know marketing : okay . so , two , yeah ? industrial designer : yeah . two yeah . user interface : yeah two yeah . because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include marketing : yeah . yep . and especially i guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , user interface : for the people to marketing : and that makes it more appealing , it 's more of a a new fun toy . user interface : we have to practically test it . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : the field test will tell you how good . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : okay , the final point , trends . marketing : and following the trends . user interface : the trends . marketing : so the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . project manager : mm . mm . marketing : so as it is , not really doing either of them . project manager : i think industrial designer : spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . marketing : well , project manager : marketing : the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : i know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but i 'm thinking one of the nokias that 's got like you ca it has n't got individual buttons industrial designer : uh okay . marketing : it 's got just a one bit on it user interface : yeah i know . marketing : and so you can that feels kinda spongy . industrial designer : but this one includes this feature , right ? spongy buttons . marketing : so it 's sort of , yeah . user interface : yeah . we we we we we yeah , it 's the way they are going to be , actually . marketing : mm . okay . industrial designer : so uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . marketing : but that 's if you 're using the covers . project manager : and the then we can al marketing : or is it just one industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yes . we can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? i mean marketing : well they make it for mobiles , it ca n't be that much more complicated . user interface : but why do you want to cover that actually ? in that uh w in the mod project manager : well just with the with the flexible plastic uh marketing : so you got the option of having different colours or different textures . industrial designer : yeah . this is possible . project manager : i th i th i think user interface : uh uh y are you sure ? yeah i think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . project manager : o o or just two things which can be put on each other . marketing : mm . industrial designer : yeah exactly like nokia phones . project manager : yes , exactly like it . uh , so maybe we can but we have to decide it , we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and s now try to invest in the in in the features . marketing : i think the if we do the cover that 's really going with the company 's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you 'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it 'll still be in fashion . project manager : mm mm mm mm mm . industrial designer : yeah . 'cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it 's all black , and uh it 's quite conventional , and sometimes people do n't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . marketing : mm . mm . industrial designer : so maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . marketing : mm . yep . project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . marketing : yep . mm . project manager : mm . mm . marketing : and then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . project manager : yes . so so so that that would make the trends equal , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so we we we really have do n't have , marketing : mm . there 's n yeah . 'cause that 's the that 's the feature that could be included in either of them . project manager : i mean marketing : although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one . project manager : yes , indeed . industrial designer : yeah , so a a point better for the for the number two . marketing : okay . so . two and three , or one and two ? user interface : yeah , it 's one . project manager : say , say one and two . one and two . industrial designer : marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so le le let 's see . so d marketing : okay . project manager : this one has spongy but buttons ? industrial designer : yeah , the blue one uh spongy . user interface : yeah , it says a project manager : mm , i see , yes okay . good . marketing : okay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five mm nine by five , one point s eight ? project manager : just add it . industrial designer : nine . project manager : you know . three , six , seven . user interface : one point six , one point one point eight yeah . marketing : this one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two user interface : four point uh four point two . industrial designer : very good . marketing : okay . but we still got a very different price for those two so they 're not really comparable yet anyway . project manager : mm-hmm . we we must try to get them closer . industrial designer : yeah , it 's right , yeah that 's right . marketing : yep . project manager : both in i i or we just have to choose . and adapt . because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . marketing : well it 's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . project manager : yes , well marketing : that 'll basically take us down to the budget . project manager : but i 'm now did y did you work with the same prices that i have here ? industrial designer : so i i give yeah i just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh i explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen fr euros . uh unfortunately we did n't see this chip , uh matthew , user interface : yeah . yep . project manager : mm , tha industrial designer : so maybe we have to recap with this one . user interface : maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah . project manager : well yes , well uh re reconsider it . so let 's let 's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : uh what kind of energy source uh i i we did n't speak about that . it 's a it 's a normal battery , or user interface : yeah , it migh it it 'll need uh more than a conventional one , it wo n't be uh just maybe you might use a a_a_ battery actually . what do you say , mael ? industrial designer : for this one it 's a normal battery . project manager : yes . just so one battery . 'kay . electronics . given speech recognition i think w you should go for the less fancy chip . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh sample speaker , yeah . project manager : yeah , yes , or sample sensor , yes . industrial designer : sample , yeah , this one . project manager : yes , this one . okay . case ? um , industrial designer : so user interface : curved . double curved yeah right . project manager : i see i user interface : it 's uh project manager : double curve . marketing : yeah , it 's gon na be more than just the biggest case , definitely . project manager : mm . industrial designer : so which one are we talking to ? user interface : are you talking about this or that ? industrial designer : well marketing : either of them . project manager : oh yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm . they 're both going to be not basic cases . project manager : but , actually bu industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so th th this would be double curves ? marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . project manager : 'kay . uh , plastic would be the material . marketing : yeah . the basic one , yep . industrial designer : is it zero franc ? user interface : a special colour ? project manager : uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers . user interface : uh marketing : so now we 're either going button or lcds , lcd display . project manager : push . mm , yes , but industrial designer : lcd is . it 's okay . just say lcd . marketing : is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ? project manager : yeah th now this is per per unit , this number of components . user interface : ah good . marketing : so it would need twelve buttons . user interface : yeah , we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? industrial designer : no but for this one it 's twelve euro . user interface : no , for that one also . industrial designer : there are twelve ? project manager : so , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , user interface : yeah that 's a scroll . project manager : t yes . twelve i believe . so this comes to eighteen . marketing : mm . and that 's without any special button supplements . user interface : yeah , one scroll wheel you might need . project manager : so marketing : so we 'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . they 're not just standard buttons . user interface : uh project manager : so i think but th do you agree th that thi industrial designer : wait a minute , it 's not it 's not double curved , it 's single curved , right ? because it 's there is no like . marketing : but i thought it would be curved on two it 's like it 's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that 's what i thought . project manager : yes i 'm i 'm no i 'm no i 'm not sh sure . yes i kno undes i understand what you mean , yes . industrial designer : it 's you know this curve like this so , it 's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are marketing : you talking about concave curves ? project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : yeah concave . project manager : both . industrial designer : so i think we can put um marketing : you think a single curved ? industrial designer : the single curved in the sixteen . that makes uh seventeen . and what are just the bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? yeah . project manager : yes . uh marketing : we have more , we 've got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah industrial designer : i had a bad uh bad estimation . user interface : bad estimate , marketing : the sc project manager : w d user interface : right ? project manager : we have we have n't talk about a , but that 's no a is very exp inexpensive i believe but it is not in the list . marketing : we 've got a scroll wheel for the volume do n't we , or is it some other thing that 's not on there . project manager : w ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ? industrial designer : no no no . marketing : 'kay we 've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . industrial designer : yes , a kind of scroll wheel . marketing : so this is even more than the um than the cost you gave , the sixteen euros . project manager : mm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay , user interface : industrial designer : so based on that , yeah , um where is the es okay sample speaker user interface : that is the sample sensor and sample speaker . project manager : so um industrial designer : but still , yeah it user interface : we just need that actually . we need one . project manager : we 're we we could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we ca n't have the the speech recognition , yes ? yes ? industrial designer : no we can not , yeah . project manager : so so w when we w a industrial designer : so project manager : this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . industrial designer : but the um yeah but if you have the near the lcd you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio , tv and v_c_r_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip . project manager : transti industrial designer : right , matthew ? user interface : oh i i it industrial designer : or regular chip ? user interface : i think it 's going to be y y industrial designer : i think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . user interface : yeah it 's th with the regular chip , yeah . project manager : say say it 's regular , regular chip , industrial designer : yeah . okay . okay . project manager : and we still on fifteen , user interface : yeah . project manager : so industrial designer : so . and what about the number of buttons buttons uh my matthew ? project manager : yes but that maybe well we can just say user interface : uh industrial designer : when you look at this w , this u uh item , user interface : yeah . project manager : ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . industrial designer : but project manager : so is it possible ? marketing : but that 's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : that 'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times . industrial designer : you can not make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really really low , project manager : user interface : project manager : no no , marketing : well project manager : he he he i i user interface : marketing : so the lcd display is is three francs , sorry three euros , by itself . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh we do n't want to to change that right ? we we really want a lcd user interface : uh project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . project manager : otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this . industrial designer : it 's evident . yeah . marketing : so twelve euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , industrial designer : and i dunno marketing : we ca n't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an lcd dispra display , that 's seven fifty um , so we 've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . and the chip . sorry the chip 's up there already . project manager : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . marketing : so we 're gon na have to scale this down to get within budget , there 's no doubt about that . project manager : a industrial designer : so wha what what each of us think about the because it 's measure point the lcd , um do you think it 's important ? user interface : or we could even replace them by buttons actually . industrial designer : because sometimes whe when you watch the tv in fact , you have a big display and maybe you do n't need one more in your hands ? i dunno , i 'm just asking . project manager : mm user interface : a actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you 'll have lcd display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two euros at least . marketing : mm . yeah . i think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the lcd display . user interface : okay so we can get rid of it industrial designer : yeah , it 's true yeah . user interface : and then add a couple of buttons . industrial designer : but uh , do we want that ? on the market point of view , yeah . what do you think uh , lcd is a major feature , or ? project manager : mm . i marketing : for the price , it 's gon na be what we can afford , and it 's looking like we ca n't afford the lcd display , there 's no way we can get it in there . mm . project manager : i think we have to come to a decision now , just i i think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the lcd uh display marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so industrial designer : you assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , right ? okay . project manager : yes . yes . one man one vote . industrial designer : okay . project manager : s so who thinks the the lcd disply display should be i should be in it ? marketing : i th i 'd like t it to be in but i ca n't see it happening . i ca n't see it fitting in . project manager : mm . mm-hmm mm-hmm . user interface : i think but industrial designer : we need to be . marketing : bu y you 're a power voter uh veto anyway as project manager . project manager : mm-hmm , i know , but industrial designer : yeah . . user interface : yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . marketing : well we have to make a decision now , that 's it . user interface : yeah . project manager : so uh uh having an lcd s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . is that acceptable ? ca can i have can the functions be implement in an you 've you you agree . user interface : w i i i just project manager : so hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . user interface : yeah . project manager : so that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons . industrial designer : because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . marketing : mm . i think then we we 're really losing ease of use . industrial designer : okay , . user interface : that will create another problem . for the people to use it . it 's not going to be easy . doing that . marketing : okay . project manager : mm . so um industrial designer : okay . project manager : i i think we should we should cut the lcd screen . that that 's that 's my opinion . user interface : no , it 's okay , you uh cut the lcd screen project manager : just user interface : and introduce two more buttons . marketing : okay . so lcd 's out , is speech rec out now ? we 've industrial designer : the speech recognition is out . because of the budget , yeah . project manager : uh where , l_c_ okay w we now we can just uh marketing : so are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . with these new costings . user interface : yeah . marketing : so just look at forget that one and look at that one now . project manager : yes . yes . i th i th i think w we just go for this one industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and that that now twelve euros is the is is the price , okay . marketing : okay . well that 's that 's project manager : my m my supervisor will be glad that it 's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . industrial designer : actually yeah , we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount , yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yep . so w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe project manager : okay . marketing : and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that 's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment . project manager : okay , good . then we the same . thank you . user interface : okay . project manager : that was it . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : thanks . user interface : that 's it . cool ."
