    "answer": "user interface : here we go again . industrial designer : my mouse is not working anymore . user interface : oh . industrial designer : he 's uh user interface : okay . industrial designer : when i put it in , is is going to beep beep beep . marketing : oh , i got a nice little screen here over here . user interface : marketing : i got like this big black border uh on every side . industrial designer : project manager : okay . user interface : mm , okay . project manager : everybody ready ? marketing : i 'll i 'll fix it . user interface : yeah , it 's okay . project manager : welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by maarten . marketing : yeah , whatever . user interface : marketing : project manager : uh this is the agenda , the opening . uh , we 've got three presentations . and i 'm gon na show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . and we 're gon na make a decision on the remote control functions . we have uh forty minutes . oh , well this is the the closing already . user interface : project manager : so uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then . uh , i think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order . user interface : okay . project manager : maybe the marketing : i do n't know what the right order is . so project manager : well , it oh that . it wo n't does n't maybe we should start with the the technical functions . industrial designer : okay , project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : how can i get this on the whiteboard ? project manager : well it 's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . user interface : in project . industrial designer : okay , i 've done that . project manager : you 've already done that ? user interface : no can that open . project manager : well let 's close this one . we 'll just uh open a new one . user interface : open it there . project manager : uh , well . yes . uh-oh . new thing . oh yeah , uh i have to say something . uh , due to some uh technical problems i have n't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . but i 'll uh make sure that uh happens next time . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : okay . about the get project manager : and i 'll get this one uh in digital uh form too . industrial designer : 'kay , we 're going to um uh talk about working design . um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . it 's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . mm , it 's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . um , the known technology can make a cost very low . uh , it 's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . and and the components are very uh very cheap . um , uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh led lights , they 're needed and they 're uh everywhere available . uh , again , it 's a fair price . it 's a common uh technology uh , like i told um uh , the circuit board , it 's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it 's it is uh can be made as fast as printing paper . it 's uh it 's all very uh project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah , they 're making it uh all the time . uh , project manager : okay . industrial designer : and it 's not uh very specialised uh technology . i have n't come to here , but um i 've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . they were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows . so i do n't know uh why i should put it here . uh project manager : okay . but it 's the technical side of the remote control . user interface : industrial designer : yes , but uh i uh have n't made it because uh of the time . project manager : oh . okay . well , we 'll we 'll have to skip that part then . industrial designer : what ? user interface : okay . project manager : but you do n't think it 's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? it 's gon na be easy ? industrial designer : no . yes . project manager : okay . user interface : but nothing restricted for user interface ? project manager : yeah . m user interface : with technical industrial designer : um , no , it 's uh it 's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah . user interface : i do n't know . project manager : okay . user interface : 'kay . industrial designer : remote control is nothing special nowadays . project manager : r regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . does n't really matter . user interface : okay . industrial designer : um user interface : but i kind of uh industrial designer : i do n't think so , project manager : okay . yeah , okay . industrial designer : because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , user interface : yes . uh project manager : okay . industrial designer : but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ? project manager : well , we 'll see . we 'll see later on . user interface : well , the technical functions . um , well i do n't know if you got the same uh pictures as i got , but uh i got these two , and i think they 're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . th i think it 's it 's very much uh depending on the user requirements , i do n't s uh know who 's doing t project manager : well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? the ones i i 've uh received from the account manager . user interface : yeah , but it i think that 's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control . project manager : yeah . well , we 'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on . user interface : yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it . project manager : uh-huh . okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v marketing : yes , i agree . yeah . project manager : yeah ? well , what that 's what you want trying to say . user interface : well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . project manager : okay . okay . user interface : but i do n't know . it 's it 's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use . project manager : yeah , well some of these uh , yeah . well , some of that will yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements . user interface : yeah , probably , yeah . project manager : so user interface : uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . i think that 's just basic what we need . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and from that on we can user requirements what we need more . uh yeah , i just um um i thought joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and i do n't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it 's com becoming less trendy or something like that . m you can just you can k marketing : i have n't really found a conclusion like that . user interface : you can keep it in mind that . marketing : yeah . user interface : i do n't know . uh , i th i thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh marketing : design . user interface : yeah , more trendier design , i think . i think . marketing : sounds interesting . project manager : user interface : yeah ? marketing : user interface : uh , well , that 's all i have to say , i think . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah , that was it . marketing : alright . project manager : well , then the marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market . marketing : yes . user interface : . marketing : yeah . it 's alright . um alright , i 've done some research for functional requirements . um yes . the working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . uh , i 've lined them up here . uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . i uh have found some interesting things . we do we do got a market . um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . so if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as i uh quoted here from the uh results . zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . that 's quite a lot . um , relevant options are , of course , power buttons . although , only used once per hour . uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . that does n't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . but it sure um says we should n't make it too uh complicated . fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . and um an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . and uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . so , what i was thinking oh , wrong side . we should n't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . group features for a higher usability , uh what i was claiming in the previous meeting . um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . project manager : okay . marketing : and um , if you want to implement v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ options , group them in the button , not too uh yeah . small buttons , so they wo n't be very um , how do you say project manager : visually presents . marketing : yes , wo n't be very present , thank you . and a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who do n't really care for trendy looks or whatever , i guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . that was kind of what i found . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : okay . project manager : well , then we i 'm gon na show you some of the new project requirements and then we gon na discuss on uh what features we find important . marketing : yes . project manager : uh , well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , i think . marketing : project manager : because um uh s decided to put they have decide to put two additional requirements forward . well , now i see four . marketing : two ? project manager : that 's kinda strange . well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . well , i think that may be so , but well , we ca n't just leave the teletext button off . user interface : well project manager : it 's impossible , i think . user interface : no way . marketing : no uh , i agree , i agree . project manager : so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and do n't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or marketing : not too much , no . project manager : you know , it 's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we have to think of that . the remote control should only be used for television . otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . so maybe we should leave all d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ related features off completely . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : i do n't know . i think that uh that 's what they 're trying to say . marketing : project manager : uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . new products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . so you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but , well , they 're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger marketing : i do n't really agree actually , to be honest . it 's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . it 's only like thirty percent of the total market . project manager : yeah , but it is it 's is a dif it 's a fact that the th th that bigger market you 're talking about , we already cover that . marketing : mayb yeah ? project manager : our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . that 's the one we have n't covered yet . so i think that 's what the problem is . we have n't got remote controls for uh marketing : okay . project manager : well i think , yeah . marketing : maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . project manager : yeah , i think so . maybe if it 's marketing : not too much then , bu alright . project manager : no no , but i think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . so maybe we can make a remote control that 's primarily interesting for the younger group , but is n't that bad for an older person either . uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . our product 's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . okay , something else nice to know . user interface : but what 's our slogan ? project manager : sorry ? yeah , you will have to look that up . user interface : the slogan uh marketing : yeah , i 'll have a look . project manager : i think it 's something about the user interface : puts fashion in electronics . marketing : we put the fashion in electronics . project manager : oh , okay . i thought it w might be , let 's make things better or something , but user interface : sense simplicity . marketing : sense and simplicity . project manager : okay well , let 's go back to the the agenda . so we 've now had to the three presentations . we know about the new project requirements . that means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . well , if i can uh make a start , i think it 's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it 's gon na be , and i already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . i think we 're we 're looking for some marketing : project manager : yeah , we we 're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic tv functions . y well , that user interface : yeah . marketing : well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that 's not very uh yeah , we do n't really need to have a simple remote control . project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : i think we can implement more functions then , because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology user interface : yeah , but wha project manager : yeah , yeah . marketing : and therefore will be a more project manager : m yeah , that 's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , i think they are are c are contradicting each other , user interface : but project manager : because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just tv , but they s do aim at a younger marketing : yes . project manager : well , ma user interface : yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions are n't used . marketing : yeah . user interface : so why should j we put this function in ? marketing : well , i think user interface : i think more i think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions . industrial designer : project manager : but i think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have y well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t tv and a d_v_d_ player . you can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the tv set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . we do n't want that . i think that was that became clear . we do n't want . but w maybe we should put some func uh , i know that the younger people will most likely have a d_v_d_ player they want to , you know , they want to uh marketing : yeah , control . user interface : yeah , but uh you said project manager : control , remotely . user interface : yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we 're making . marketing : project manager : no , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the the new project requirements told us not to user interface : it 's n yeah . project manager : but maybe w yeah . i think we maybe should user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . but just the basic functions . maybe like rewind and wind , or n what d what do you guys think ? industrial designer : but you can put them under the same button . marketing : not much more than that . project manager : yeah , if as far as possible . marketing : yep . or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever . project manager : but what do you think ? do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ? no , you do n't think so ? marketing : user interface : no , new requirements say no . project manager : yeah , the new requirements say so . user interface : so industrial designer : but you can put a play and stop and and rewind . project manager : well , maybe it 's marketing : yeah . project manager : maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions do n't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . user interface : yeah , but project manager : you know , a lot of d_v_d_ players have some tricky settings with industrial designer : yes , but we user interface : i i if it 's too simple uh th they wo n't use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions . marketing : y yes . project manager : yep , exactly . that 's that 's wha marketing : but but for for example , v_c_r_ , that 's better example in this case . i think on a remote control for television you do n't need to be able to programme uh the v_c_r_ to start recording at three p_m_ or whatever , project manager : no no , you do n't no no , you do n't need it . no , no . user interface : no , no . exactly . marketing : just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward . project manager : okay , but we have to think uh w we have to think d_v_d_ i th uh , i guess , marketing : yeah , i know , but uh project manager : so um but uh from my experience it 's kinda a lot of d_v_d_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . it 's c sometimes a bit difficult . user interface : mm , yeah . project manager : maybe if we just leave the d_v_d_ functional m uh well , i was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , i think we m should focus on the tv then . marketing : yes . user interface : yeah , but just keep it simple and look more at th project manager : and uh and it 's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . if you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . user interface : no . it 's only for television . so project manager : okay . it 's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , industrial designer : yes , but there are there are project manager : and it 's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , nothing more . exactly . project manager : okay . marketing : alright . project manager : um , but what televis industrial designer : but how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? there are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have project manager : yeah , we we 'll make w this one trendy . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : and simple . user interface : the user interface is easy . project manager : well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . so we should put uh zap buttons on it . um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels . user interface : and the basic yeah , basic functions , yeah . marketing : yes , definitely , yeah . user interface : it 's too much integrated in the other . project manager : okay , a t a teletext button should be there . but just one big teletext button , on and off . user interface : yeah . project manager : probably . marketing : yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that . i think stop function is very useful . if you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , project manager : oh , okay . marketing : then i think it 's very irritating if the next page shows up , but project manager : yeah , but uh i think that becomes too difficult , it 's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . marketing : well , i use it very regularly , the action . i re i use it quite often . project manager : yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but i 've never heard of it in the first place . and user interface : will you look marketing : industrial designer : project manager : we have to well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . user interface : look at the market . project manager : we just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . yeah . i do n't know . i think that that 's kin getting too complex for our remote . user interface : well project manager : i do n't know what you th guys think . marketing : might be . might be . user interface : yeah , i uh , it 's sunday i always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh project manager : yeah , but do you like to have a such a s stop button ? or do you think it uh i think it 's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function . user interface : well , uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um , a couple of weeks ago i looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th project manager : yeah . okay , it goes yeah , but that 's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . that 's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements . industrial designer : yes , but you could put user interface : yeah , but industrial designer : on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . project manager : well yeah uh , industrial designer : if you have seven pages , you can go up and down . project manager : lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using i think we should just put one teletext button on it . user interface : true . project manager : then we meet uh the new requirements . we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , i guess . user interface : a simple yeah . project manager : okay . um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ? or do we uh i dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . we have the zap and uh the volume . should we do m make them very big ? the the the zap button . d d marketing : i think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , project manager : th that 's that 's that 's considered to be trendy also . user interface : but trendy , yeah . project manager : or maybe you should place them on a uh , in a special way ? user interface : i do n't know . industrial designer : maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick . project manager : yeah , something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah , and quick . you have to use it very quickly . user interface : original . it was uh true . marketing : if you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus . project manager : yeah , and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace . oh , what should we decide on then ? i think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh were n't worked out already , but it w should n't be a problem then . industrial designer : but user interface : yeah . industrial designer : no , it 's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest . user interface : maybe uh project manager : no , okay , but we do n't have to uh , when we do n't want to uh control other devices , i think it makes it even more simple . user interface : uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe . if you use large batteries or small batter batteries . project manager : i think industrial designer : the most standard batteries . project manager : i think that we should use uh d user interface : yeah ? marketing : i think double a_ . project manager : yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh well , it has to be simple , and i wi user interface : yeah . marketing : the most ordinary uh batteries . project manager : which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know . user interface : okay . project manager : oh . how much time do we ha we have left uh ? m m m more than thirty minutes ? marketing : i think about twenty minutes . project manager : uh ten twenty minutes . well , uh these these should n't user interface : early break . industrial designer : but i in a way we have to be uh uh special . project manager : yeah . yeah , okay . but that 's that 's do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? how we can what the extra touch can be . do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or industrial designer : maybe th m project manager : well , it was something about how we lose them . maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . marketing : i think that 's n that 's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever . user interface : to find him . that 's maybe yeah . project manager : yeah . i do n't know . i do n't know . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : nah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . it w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i has something nice . marketing : yeah , yeah , that 's good one , yep . project manager : or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , user interface : yeah . project manager : or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener . maybe it contains some feature that you do n't normally link to a remote control . i think it 's very impor because we 're gon na make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . user interface : yeah . project manager : it 's gon na cost twenty five euros . marketing : ye i think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination . project manager : yeah , but the well , it 's already been done . user interface : yeah , but that 's yeah . project manager : nah . yeah , that 's true . but and i think it 's gon na be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . it has to be used something special , user interface : yeah . project manager : and you really it has to , you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . we 're really gon na use them . not some thing you you throw away next week , you know . marketing : no , that 's true . project manager : so maybe uh that 's i i think that 's when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it 's very important to find something like this . so there 's a very important task for you . and maybe we can all think about it . user interface : be original , yeah . project manager : uh , also for you maybe , when t you it 's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know . user interface : mm-hmm . and use friendly , yeah . project manager : so big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : project manager : uh-huh . user interface : must brain-storm . marketing : yeah , a swapable front or whatever . project manager : yeah , or just different colours would be uh i do n't know if people also wan na spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . user interface : well industrial designer : for the remote control . project manager : it could be be yeah , you never know , but user interface : why not ? marketing : yeah . user interface : more money for us . marketing : project manager : but it and i think we have to make it quite big . user interface : yeah . quite big . yeah , you think ? project manager : yeah , marketing : yes , definitely , definitely . project manager : people industrial designer : that 's to be uh a formed for your hand . project manager : so , and and also because uh it is expensive . if you want it to be something , you know , it 's ha does n't have much functions marketing : project manager : want to be you do n't want to get it l make it marketing : yes , it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room . as i uh as i said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o project manager : mm-hmm . and shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . i i think you m might wan na put it uh user interface : a standard or something . project manager : yeah , that it it it it stands up . yeah , you have to put it on its so it 's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . marketing : yeah . a face ? project manager : no no , put stuff inside it . but , it 's like like a statue or something marketing : or uh yeah , yeah . yeah . user interface : industrial designer : more like a joystick then . marketing : yeah , yeah , i see what you mean , yep . user interface : it 's like you have uh four phones . something like that . project manager : yeah yeah , but yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in marketing : if you do that , but i do n't know if that 's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half euros . project manager : that it 's it 's fashionable . user interface : project manager : i i do n't marketing : i in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . project manager : oh , yeah . marketing : that 's probably stupid , but uh as i found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ? industrial designer : but that 's that 's fun for the first time , and then the second marketing : uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control . project manager : yeah , but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it marketing : no uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in . project manager : oh , okay . user interface : on the television . project manager : uh , that 's kind of nice . user interface : oh , like this . marketing : if an a button in in that uh user interface : project manager : and then also you do n't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . industrial designer : or you can user interface : a char chargeable . yeah . marketing : yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . why not . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah , that w yeah , but yeah , the pro no , well i think that it might be t p well , nee but we do n't yeah . user interface : why not . project manager : maybe you , but we do n't know much about production cost , but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on a remote control and it 's a basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , rechargeable units . industrial designer : with recharger . user interface : marketing : it should only cost twelve and a half euros , of course . aye ? project manager : yeah , but we would d ma we 'd do it in taiwan and so , it 's not gon na be that expen user interface : production . marketing : yeah , okay . project manager : uh i i think it 's a great idea . user interface : it should be possible . i think it 's a good idea . marketing : yeah . project manager : s some kind of be i 've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays . user interface : to make a base or something ? marketing : yes . yes , definitely . yeah . industrial designer : yes , but is that handy ? project manager : well , i well it 's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . that 's one . user interface : it 's it 's it 's it 's project manager : and uh you can always find your remote control up user interface : it 's not the purpose to be handy , it 's industrial designer : but but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries . project manager : uh , okay . well , maybe yeah , you could when that 's when it 's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , industrial designer : and then you project manager : but you will you do need uh also an uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . does it makes it kinda industrial designer : yes . or marketing : well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . user interface : mm . yeah , but that 's not it 's ugly , i think . project manager : yeah , yeah . okay . yeah . marketing : i do n't know . project manager : yeah , but then it 's very easy to make it also a rechargeab i do n't think that is gon na cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . marketing : on the other hand , if you do n't do it , we can also make a nice bay . i mean , it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it , project manager : yeah . marketing : but um i think the bay is definitely uh project manager : i think it 's a good idea . and make it , you know , we we um well , we uh it 's it is n't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . we can save on the on the functions . we just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there 's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , marketing : sure , why not . yep . project manager : it 's also nice . and if you put it away , i think it 's uh w we have to we uh that 's uh marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's not a easy market . user interface : yeah . project manager : we have to something special . and for twenty five euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , marketing : yeah . user interface : true . project manager : and we ca n't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions , user interface : yeah . marketing : definitely . project manager : because we are n't gon na put marketing : with eye candy , ear candy , whatever . yeah , definitely . project manager : yeah . and then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing . yeah . i think i think it 's a good idea . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have . project manager : yeah . marketing : definitely , yeah . project manager : oh , if it let 's well , we will see what 's possible concerning the the costs , and if it 's possible we 'll do that . and we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . user interface : yeah . project manager : and the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . if that 's too expensive , we wo n't do that . user interface : yeah , we c project manager : but it would be nice . marketing : it would be nice , yes . project manager : it 's the idea . i know that batteries last long nowadays . and and what people just think about , well , i 'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it 's very annoying when your battery is empty . and you know then when you have n't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo i 've experienced that that marketing : most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes . project manager : yeah , okay . so , easy functions . well , we will we will i think we 'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi user interface : or just give a beep when the battery 's out or uh down . project manager : yeah . but it 's also annoying . marketing : yeah , why not . user interface : project manager : 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you 're not very motivated to do something about it . user interface : yeah . true . project manager : then it beeps all the time and . marketing : no , that 's true . project manager : you do n't want to have ever have those problems , and you wo n't have if if you have the rechargeable . and you do n't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people do n't like it . uh , i i in the in the ma marketing : why not . industrial designer : but you pay for it . project manager : yeah , but it w i mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that 's a great idea , i 'm gon na use it . and when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , i 'll never put him in the recharger , i think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . then when they look get m i i i know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they 're seeking for the remote control , they wan na see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , user interface : yeah . project manager : i think it 's brilliant . marketing : bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . yeah . project manager : yeah , i 've never it 's so simple , but i 've never seen it . user interface : yeah . project manager : m maybe we should really do this . user interface : and you can leave it just there . marketing : no . nearly . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? these clocks are n't uh synched . user interface : yes . marketing : project manager : oh , now i 've put uh well , it is twenty p user interface : yeah , i 'll project manager : okay , so we have ten minutes or something ? marketing : something like that , yeah . project manager : yeah , but we 're uh we 're done . i think . user interface : uh fifteen minutes . project manager : we 've decided on the functions . well , there is some oh . there is a closing sheet . we have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . user interface : project manager : oh okay , i 'll make sure i 'll i had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes wo n't be a problem , but i 'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it wo n't work , but you 'll see . i think these are more important than the first ones , so marketing : we 'll see . user interface : can you make an uh uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? project manager : . user interface : that not not everything in one one uh folder . marketing : maarten , five minutes . project manager : oh , five minutes . yeah , because uh i i d i did uh the first minutes i did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . then i did a s second one with a nicer layout , which i could uh , know , use for the other ones well , but uh i d think uh i forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it 's get it 's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something . user interface : yeah . maybe . marketing : no , that 's true uh , yeah . project manager : and then you you had to overwrite it or someth i do n't know . becau i d uh , it was not my uh pen . marketing : should we by the way draw um project manager : this kind of looks you like . marketing : on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of project manager : of the shape . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , probably , it would be nice . user interface : or the sh marketing : i dunno . has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? user interface : do you get an idea of the shape ? marketing : i do n't , for one . industrial designer : maybe like this pen . marketing : a bit bigger i guess , but project manager : no , bigger . user interface : a little bit bigger , yeah but marketing : the shape is nice , it 's um something different , and we want we want that . industrial designer : it has to feel nice in your hand . project manager : well , i i i have to say , i have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all , marketing : yeah . user interface : project manager : or i think some maybe we should no , that will be too costly . user interface : oh , uh look uh look at the pictures . project manager : we shou we could also , that was a would also be an idea , but i do n't think it i do n't know if it exists already , you should like make alessi or something design it . marketing : okay , yeah . project manager : that would also be nice . but that 's gon na then you c then you do n't marketing : yeah , but twelve and a half euros ? uh project manager : yeah , but then you do n't have t yeah it that 's not something i that 's in the production cost a one it 's a one time , you know s was it 's a single cost . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , m but but then you can nah , i do n't thin i think that it would be more expensive , because i 've bought the alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive . marketing : yeah , that 's true . project manager : would be a nice idea though . i do n't know . i think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something . like something like that or so or so marketing : something like that is very ergonomic . project manager : and on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . it 's also round . marketing : so project manager : put it in there uh wire on it . marketing : yeah . project manager : maybe uh , i do n't know , some some lights , a big but well . user interface : yeah , flash lights at the side . at the side , or something like that . project manager : volume and programme , yeah . marketing : yes , volume and programme should be there i guess , because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part . project manager : and some of the extra funct some of the extra functions over here . numbers . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , and the numbers on top , i guess . user interface : yeah . project manager : and and lights ? how we 're g well , maybe uh s a ring of no , no , you have to maybe on the side of it . marketing : maybe ro roun rounds user interface : yeah , side of it . marketing : uh uh l sorry . project manager : along the side uh strip of yeah . user interface : just two leds or something on the side . yeah . marketing : maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons . project manager : yeah , but i also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote . marketing : oh . okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : well , theys have to be user interface : well , uh probably at the side . you know look at the front , but project manager : yeah . yeah , yeah . exactly . when you you see it from the side , then it would look just like that . and then you have a strip of uh lights or something user interface : yeah , exactly , and then there is yeah . yeah , something like that , yeah . marketing : okay , yeah . project manager : well , uh i think it 's nice , for one thing . maybe put something on top of it or , you know , like that 's looks funny . user interface : no . no . marketing : project manager : i do n't know . or some bump . marketing : i think i think that 'll be too big tha too big then . project manager : maybe some yeah ? user interface : bumper or something . project manager : we 'll have to think about it . i think we 're we 're done . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yes , we are . project manager : we can save this one . user interface : lunch break . marketing : alright . yes , i guess it 's lunch time . user interface : okay then . project manager : mm mm . marketing : i do n't know . half and hour ? user interface : okay , five uh marketing : i thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour . project manager : yeah , that was what uh
