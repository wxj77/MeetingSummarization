    "query": "<s> what could they do to make the remote more modern and high-class in regard to its function design ?",
    "answer": "marketing : mm-hmm . and so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , much like any small appliance like a cellphone , user interface : lost . marketing : and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it 's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we do n't want to go we do n't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , yes . and so personally i think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . so saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , i think that we should go with something that 's more user-friendly . and also we found our team found that speech recognition is it 's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . project manager : and so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? marketing : i guess so , yeah . user interface : project manager : okay . user interface : to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . project manager : oh , that 'd be lovely . marketing : yeah , i guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . user interface : yeah . project manager : did n't they um did n't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the tv and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it user interface : it 's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . project manager : mm . oh , yeah , that 's true . user interface : you know like go to the base ."
