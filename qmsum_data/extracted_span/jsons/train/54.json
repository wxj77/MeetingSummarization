    "answer": "marketing : uh then uh the methodology i adopted to find out all this was market survey . a a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . and what we got was , we found that if you uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . they are not so good looking . so , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . and yes that 's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . so even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . project manager : excellent . marketing : then and the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because i think i believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . so this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . so we have to take care of this fact also . then . uh it was function i want to go to . project manager : oh you wan na go back ? just escape . marketing : uh , escape , okay thank you . then if we look at this slide , project manager : okay . marketing : uh these are in your shared documents , you can see , project manager : okay . marketing : like uh , sorry . user interface : so , sorry i was just gon na say , what was the question for this ? or is are you coming on to that ? marketing : ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . user interface : okay . so these percentages are are what ? marketing : yeah , these are different age group persons like uh sorry , i can open it in another way . project manager : okay . speech recognition . marketing : uh , yes . if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . industrial designer : marketing : so we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , and i uh and i think that most of the users of the rem uh tv are belong to this age group . so we should look project manager : hmm . we 're als we we 're looking at who buys it as well . marketing : yeah . we can look at that that factor also , so yes . project manager : uh , which i think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm , mm . marketing : so , and and then project manager : fifteen to twe marketing : yes . i think so . uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . project manager :"
