    "query": "<s> what did industrial designer propose when discussing energy sources ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : and so my personal preferences i i just think we need sorta big uh energy source that wo n't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it 'd constantly be charged , so you would n't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel 'll still be changed . uh also definitely a user-friendly interface um and i think we 've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . and that 's pretty much it . project manager : okay . uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um industrial designer : mm . project manager : i think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one . um i do n't suppose we 've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . um given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that 's uh , you know never needs replacing . industrial designer : project manager : um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one some sort of typical usage . you know , the the the battery will last know , five , ten years . by which time i mean when all 's said and done , the digital television will be taking over in that time scale . um marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh industrial designer : just having one that 's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? project manager : yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we 'll we 'll give 'em a new one . industrial designer : oh , cool . yeah , fair enough . user interface : project manager : um it 's , you know , it 's what it saves in cost and you know there there 's a well , it 's actually a marketing gimmick . i mean it 's hardly a gimmick , it 's uh it 's totally practical . uh so i th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you 're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it 's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it marketing : it could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm , mm . project manager : are are people really gon na use it though ? um . user interface : yeah , people are pro marketing : i suppose , yeah . industrial designer : mm yeah user interface : i would think that people might forget project manager : i i th i think user interface : i mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , industrial designer : mm-mm . project manager : yeah , it 's marketing : yeah . project manager : um i mean i know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh i should have put the phone on to charge and then then she 's had those for so long that if she has n't worked that out by now . um . industrial designer : 'cause i only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies . and that 's pretty much user interface : yeah . marketing : project manager : when it yeah , wh when it 's died is a problem . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , when it turns itself off , that 's when i plug it in , project manager : yeah , yeah , yeah , so uh um industrial designer : yeah . user interface : project manager : what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ? industrial designer : yeah , think that 's a good idea . marketing : uh . that sounds pretty good , yeah . project manager : is the uh you know , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here . um you know , cut cost within the manufacturing and uh you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective . user interface : do they make batteries that last that long ? project manager : i mean th th certainly . um i ca n't think of anything off the s top of my head , industrial designer : they usually have the little light uh source , project manager : but there are certainly things that you buy . i mean calculators for example . industrial designer : i dunno what the heck they 're called , user interface : yeah , they have that little solar industrial designer : the but project manager : som well some do , industrial designer : yeah , the little cells that project manager : i mean th th but there are battery ones industrial designer : yeah . project manager : that um are you know , sort of permanently sealed . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : in in fact i 'd user interface : yeah ."
