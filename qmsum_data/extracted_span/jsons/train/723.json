    "answer": "industrial designer : components design , um uh first of all uh i would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things i uh uh elaborate some of the things i did . i i elaborated on the concept . what should be um uh said about uh the components , uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . uh well first of all i 've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control 's formed . uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . i would like to uh give you an idea of uh how i thought about . marketing : do n't destroy my giraffe . industrial designer : giraffe 's gone now . marketing : user interface : industrial designer : okay um the case was is made from rubber , i suppose . there 's one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control marketing : drop it . industrial designer : and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option . but uh it 's a very expensive material . uh rubber is , i think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control . um it 's poss it 's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour . uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it 's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that 's sor uh that 's that 's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , so if you scratch it it 's still the same colour , perhaps uh it 's a little bit damaged . but it 's a very strong material . um i h i had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . user interface : industrial designer : uh so it 's t two dimensional . i think it 's uh it 's best to draw oh user interface : it 's a colour . industrial designer : green . marketing : bright colour . fancy colour . forward . industrial designer : uh new . blank . okay . marketing : you have to go t industrial designer : let 's make it uh black . okay . i thought of an idea like this . oh that . um delete . blank . okay . so it also looks nice when it 's on your table . so you get uh it does n't lay flat down on the table , but it 's c it 's stands . marketing : oh it 's a side view . industrial designer : side view yes it 's side view so uh i i 'm not technically good at th three d_ modelling , user interface : marketing : industrial designer : um uh it 's just an idea i had so it 's uh it 's very uh so its also looks nice when it 's on the table . um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . uh i thought about uh the lcd touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too . one of the great uh advantages of the lcd screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . user interface : industrial designer : and um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . well i already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and i think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . marketing : true . industrial designer : so uh uh that 's all about uh the buttons . uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . questions , ? user interface : no . marketing : no no no no no . just looking . industrial designer : and they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . and next step is the chip uh th the component that 's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but i think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it user interface : industrial designer : with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side . uh my personal preferences uh i also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . that was correct , was n't it ? project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay . i think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber . user interface : project manager : well , business colours i thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , so yeah , it needs colour , industrial designer : okay they should be m sh they should be in mind , project manager : but i do n't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . industrial designer : was n't it ? okay so it d it does n't says uh to uh have the slogan ? project manager : it must be recognisable . industrial designer : okay okay . well that 's possible of course . user interface : you can put the r_ and r_ . industrial designer : we could make a little r_ and r_ on the top of the machine . uh so they are pretty boring , i suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it 's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people in which people will find they 're uh interesting . and uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . uh s as i said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it 's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . and i personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , because it yeah it makes sense . user interface : industrial designer : okay . well that 's all about my uh my findings . user interface : alright . project manager : okay , thank you . user interface : i will go next . marketing : mm mm mm . next . user interface : alright so industrial designer : user interface : i thought a little bit about the interface . uh how it should look . and uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an lcd screen , so i had to uh look on that . and the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . and this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . and they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . and so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning joe or what 's your name . this uh and there 's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . um perhaps it 's useful , perhaps for because people um lose the remote , they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something . industrial designer : marketing : it 's true . user interface : and perhaps we could uh implement that . industrial designer : user interface : and then i have to go out of the presentation because i tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like industrial designer : oh my god . user interface : but i ca n't draw , so uh do n't make too much of it . i tried to uh the lcd screen i tried to sort of to draw . i thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . i do n't know if there is an icon for the program , but industrial designer : not just a p_ . user interface : yeah . marketing : p_ yeah , just a p_ . industrial designer : .. . user interface : and then the buttons above and uh below marketing : user interface : the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . um . marketing : where 's where 's the button for two ? user interface : i forgot that one . i thought i forgot something , marketing : okay . user interface : but uh . industrial designer : user interface : and uh and uh the numbers , that should be a bit larger i think it 's not really on scale and and so forth . marketing : does n't matter . user interface : um an options button . and i thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it 's not really options , i think . it 's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the tv and that kind of uh thing . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so could call it settings or something . but this is a bit uh how i thought it . and uh the lcd uh somewhere on the remote . perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it 's better in your hand or something uh . industrial designer : oh okay , user interface : but uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this . industrial designer : oh yeah , . user interface : and uh it 's also uh i thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people do n't really want to use uh these extra settings . and older people a also do n't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . so they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh and you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . industrial designer : mm . okay . user interface : that 's an option . and that was my uh finding dinge . project manager : thanks . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : now our third industrial designer : go danny , go danny . project manager : team member with his presentation . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : okay , i 'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . the trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . 'kay . the method i used was like i told i watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . so we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . findings i made . the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . the second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the lcd screen that 's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . and the third thing is it should be easy to use . i think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . the personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff . industrial designer : fruity ? user interface : grass green . industrial designer : fruity . marketing : yeah . like that . the round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . industrial designer : mm . okay . marketing : it should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s sponge bob like things . user interface : let 's build it into a sponge . industrial designer : marketing : th elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . they liked square shapes with round edges . and hard materials like wood , um titanium . they those kind of materials they liked . this is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . and then i th i i personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like project manager : oh y marketing : this or something . it 's it 's a bit like a banana . and the colour should be yellow , or something . and for the elderly people just plain old . because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ? user interface : it was one remote , i think , marketing : different colours , yeah . user interface : different colours . marketing : we should decide whether it 's going to be with round shapes . i think like my colleague , you said , is that 's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the ipod or something , with round squares . simple but easy to use . so that 's it . project manager : so for the older people , a more traditional uh form . industrial designer : okay . marketing : that is my yeah , like the older o older colours i can maybe user interface : you could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . i do n't know which shape you should should take , marketing : yeah . colours th the elderly people project manager : yeah , i guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh user interface : yeah . industrial designer : changing just the shape of the uh remote control ? project manager : the shape of it . user interface : perhaps you could find something in the middle . round but square . industrial designer : yeah , s round corners , but s but square , yeah . project manager : but maybe then both groups wo n't buy it . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : user interface : uh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i do you know what i mean ? industrial designer : yeah i know what you mean , kind of like a . user interface : wait , like like this uh a bit . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so it 's a bit square , but it 's also a bit uh round . industrial designer : kinda like a beer glass . yeah . user interface : so but then industrial designer : i know what you mean . user interface : same sides . but that 's uh industrial designer : it 's also easy to to have to to put in your hand . user interface : yeah but that 's also how other remotes are shaped , so that 's uh but perhaps that 's a good thing , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so that 's easy to use . people know the industrial designer : will recognise that 's as a remote control . user interface : yeah . marketing : uh look something like that . autumn colours like red , brown . industrial designer : uh when i saw your d oh . marketing : they liked the wood a lot . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . marketing : so maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , kinda like old cars , uh marketing : and a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : swords . industrial designer : let 's put it all together . marketing : those kind of yeah , those kind of things . so you see the big difference between the young people ? fresh , exciting . user interface : yeah . marketing : and the old people , old and boring . user interface : but that 's easily to do with the colour , i think . project manager : marketing : so sorry ? user interface : that 's easy to do with the colours , i think . marketing : yeah i think it 's it 's easier to do in colour than in shape . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah we think so too . marketing : because otherwise we have to get different shapes , and colour way easier than yeah the shapes . in material yeah rubber , rubber is , like i said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones industrial designer : marketing : and the old people like plain wood . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so we have to decide if we 're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . or something something between that . user interface : yeah think uh also in between . industrial designer : soft rubber . marketing : yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it . industrial designer : yeah i know what you um . user interface : i do n't think you should be able to mould it , marketing : or user interface : but industrial designer : it should should n't be . marketing : no . or or wh what 's something harder . no no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . that 's the bit you can press it in , user interface : yeah . marketing : or something harder . user interface : bit like this kind of rubber . this uh marketing : yeah , something like this , yeah . user interface : but it 's quite hard , this . marketing : yeah it 's quite hard but you can press it in . user interface : yeah . marketing : it 's feels kind s spongy . user interface : industrial designer : spongy . marketing : something . user interface : i do n't think it 's rubber . marketing : no . n n n project manager : so we need a spongy feeling . user interface : uh did you have something about uh marketing : are you going to invite sponge bob , maybe he can industrial designer : yeah . project manager : user interface : so we should first decide about shape , i think . industrial designer : ding ding . user interface : which uh marketing : yeah i think that 's the better thing to do . user interface : then you can fit the lcd screen in it , and can decide uh . industrial designer : um i also s uh ca n't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control user interface : industrial designer : and the lcd screen was uh rather small . um . marketing : w i think that lcd screen should be like user interface : it it 's supposed to be bit s bit s bit industrial designer : .. . this was your size , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but i think it should be larger . marketing : yeah three quarter of the of the industrial designer : yeah , three quarters . so uh so you do n't have to put your oh . marketing : yeah the buttons wo n't get that small when the lcd screen is industrial designer : uh new , blank . so uh when you get this uh user interface : ooh industrial designer : uh kinda like this . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : or should it be larger ? marketing : larger i think . industrial designer : larger ? because you want to put your hands user interface : but if you pu now you can put your hand there and then you wo n't touch the screen . industrial designer : you want marketing : becau because you have user interface : perhaps that 's best . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah okay , true , true , true true . industrial designer : your thumb here . user interface : but not on the screen because yeah industrial designer : yeah . user interface : that 's uh that 's an idea . marketing : yeah . user interface : looks a bit like a game boy now . industrial designer : because when you put your f yeah but if yo if you make the the lcd screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you 'll you 'll always get some user interface : you always touch it , industrial designer : you user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah yeah yeah yeah . industrial designer : going to be very greasy and stuff . marketing : but it wo n't get that small because you have how much ? nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . user interface : yeah . marketing : one to zero , the two digit , industrial designer : yeah you do n't want it too small . how yeah how large marketing : you have to you have to because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . industrial designer : yeah they have thick fingers . but if you wan na make it in international , japanese uh people got uh rather small hands marketing : yeah true , industrial designer : and we got these large marketing : but yeah , we have we have the zoom option , right ? industrial designer : zoom opt ah yeah of course , yeah . you can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button . marketing : yeah ."
