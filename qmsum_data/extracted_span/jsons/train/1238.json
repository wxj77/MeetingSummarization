    "answer": "user interface : well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? function-wise , what does that do that project manager : oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing ? marketing : yeah wh wh what 's the wh user interface : yeah . well it 's it 's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . project manager : mm 'kay industrial designer : but would we marketing : okay now what i see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . so from a marketing standpoint i have i have another door to walk through when we have something that 's unique . project manager : yeah . marketing : if it creates something more complex or more expensive , then i do n't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . but again , from a marketing perspective i want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we 're we 're co it 's a very competitive market . project manager : what i understand about scroll wheels is they 're they 're quite expensive to to make . user interface : yeah . project manager : so i d user interface : th they are gon na be more expensive , but on the other hand , i mean , it i mean it is an alternative if if you think that 's gon na sell some some uh you know if if we 're gon na make up the extra cost by extra sales i think maybe it 's worth it to do it , but i mean i would just use if i was gon na do this i would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . i do n't think volume or do you think volume would be industrial designer : i dunno . i 'll bet first in volume maybe . i dunno . user interface : no we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but so the scroll wheel , in or out ? project manager : mm pr my personal preference is out . i do n't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and i do n't s think it 's obvious and natural how it would be used . industrial designer : yeah . yeah i think we have like and it 's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , 'cause it 's it it breaks down easier . marketing : yeah . user interface : for me i think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . marketing : user interface : i do n't know exactly what the increased cost is gon na be , but i think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they 're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . i think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that . project manager : but then that that surely d depends a little on the tv because some tvs are quite slow at changing channels from like so user interface : sure . project manager : if you 've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you 're actually keeping in pace with the tv 's ability to to change channels . or do you have to go through and you wait for it ? marketing : yeah . project manager : you scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to user interface : well i think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it 's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it 's where it 's quantized into you know certain marketing : oh yeah . project manager : uh i see i see . that 's where you user interface : that was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be . marketing : yeah . project manager : ah i see i see what you 're talking about now . okay . marketing : user interface : it 's just it 's basically it it 's just a f look and feel thing . it has the same exact functionality as two buttons . marketing : i i think there 's you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers , and i see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . project manager : yeah if you 're just sitting there going marketing : instead of going button-to-bu you just j you 'd j j j j j j . user interface : yeah . project manager : that 's kinda cool actually . marketing : i really i really think that 's a really cool thing for surfing . project manager : i like that . user interface : now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of tvs wo n't re the tvs wo n't respond exactly the same . some of them are gon na be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it 'll be like flip , flip , flip . marketing : well there 's ano project manager : well not n necessarily . user interface : but project manager : you could basically make it so that it 'll i mean it 's just gon na be sending a signal to the tv yeah the tv 's ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it 's gon na flip once . user interface : right . marketing : that 's right . project manager : if you do that . user interface : yeah it just might be frustrating where you ca n't make it go as fast as you want , project manager : other than click click click . yeah . user interface : but i think once people get used to it i i do like the idea of the scroll wheel though . project manager : and if we 're marketing it as a high niche product , then we 're gon na be selling it to people who are buying good tvs as well , yeah , presumably . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : primarily . user interface : marketing : yeah i think so . i i think so . now the the only thing i i on the interface side of it , is that i i i see the dilemma . but if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so i can go uh presuming i have , on my television , something that tells me what channel i 'm on , i can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . i know what because it 's on the television . the television tells me what channel it 's on when i change it . so i do n't know that really that 's that 's gon na be a a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . okay ?"
