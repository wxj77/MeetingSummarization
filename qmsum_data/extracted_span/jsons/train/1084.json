    "query": "<s> what did the team talk about button design of the remote control ?",
    "answer": "project manager : so anyway , yeah , we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . i mean what do you want , do you want , but user interface : yeah , but we like some some curves or project manager : yeah , may maybe something like this . but though smooth inside . so you have the transmitter here for example . user interface : yeah . project manager : let 's see that you what would be handy . i think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . marketing : uh . and a light uh project manager : let 's see one , two god damn it . user interface : oh , we get the general ideas , yes . project manager : yeah , okay . another one here . let 's see what i think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here . user interface : yeah , and since you 're holding it like this , i suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume project manager : think it 's like this . marketing : volume . project manager : withi within the yeah , just take it . user interface : yeah yeah . so you have the up channel the down channel the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ? project manager : do you take triangles or marketing : uh it 's it 's fine , i think . project manager : um i think it should be i think it user interface : this is basically what people are accustomed to , project manager : maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . user interface : so industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , but this is just a g general idea . marketing : oh d project manager : yeah . user interface : uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . project manager : yeah , in the middle . it 's it 's usually uh there , but mm . user interface : whoa . industrial designer : perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it 's lost , for people that are deaf . they they wo n't hear the the beep . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , but for example if it 's lost in your armchair , we 'll not see the flash . user interface : you wo n't be able to find it . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and flash takes up a lot of batteries again . industrial designer : uh . yeah , it 's true , but it 's it 's only has to do so when you press the button that it 's lost . marketing : just project manager : yeah . user interface : we could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up . industrial designer : so . deaf people ? marketing : and l_e_d_ uh on it . project manager : yeah , i thought about for deaf people for example , so . we could do that . uh let 's see . marketing : just a light on it or user interface : so we have the basic channels we 've got here , uh the power button somewhere over here ? project manager : oh yeah , it 's true . um that thing should be central . marketing : very important . project manager : you should n't be you uh should n't press it by accident , but it should n't be stacked away somewhere . user interface : i usually press it on top . marketing : that 's it 's project manager : yeah . user interface : at least that 's what i 'm accustomed to . industrial designer : i have another idea , project manager : yeah , like that 's gon na work . industrial designer : i 'm not sure if it 's possible . marketing : and user interface : what would you like to ? project manager : yeah , i thought maybe we should move the buttons down marketing : but you r project manager : and put it here for example marketing : and you are reading from the t project manager : to marketing : you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . project manager : from top to bottom . yeah , that 's true , marketing : yeah , project manager : you should marketing : so it 's project manager : i think the bu the power button should be on top , marketing : yeah . project manager : 'cause it 's the first thing you do , turn it on . so power button on top . um user interface : okay , mute button . is that somewhere here ? project manager : mute . do we hardly i think it should be at the bottom somewhere . user interface : is that used often ? marketing : so i it 's user interface : the mute button ? do people use that often ? marketing : sorry ? project manager : mute . turn the sound off . marketing : no , it 's no . user interface : 'cause uh i 'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here , at least in general , marketing : uh . hmm . user interface : but project manager : i do n't think it 's important , but i think it i think it should be you c user interface : it 's not that important , no . project manager : you could put it somewhere here . marketing : or or with the volume selection . project manager : no , because it yeah , people are accustomed to that , marketing : around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection . project manager : it 's can i have that ? that 's j user interface : sure . marketing : i do n't know where exactly , project manager : take this out and here see marketing : but project manager : uh are we gon na take triangles anyway ? i 'm drawing triangles , but marketing : user interface : that 's pretty much what people are accustomed to , project manager : yeah , user interface : are n't they ? project manager : it 's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . so anyway , i think this is should be the channels and or sh user interface : well , i 'm accustomed to the channels being on top . marketing : no . yeah . project manager : here , industrial designer : yeah , me too . project manager : okay . okay , marketing : yeah , that 's better . project manager : should we chan marketing : on the right ."
