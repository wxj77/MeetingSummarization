    "answer": "grad c : i guess i 'm just a little hesitant to try to go whole hog on sort of the the whole framework that that nist is talking about , with atlas and a database and all that sort of stuff , phd f : so grad c : cuz it 's a big learning curve , just to get going . whereas if we just do a flat file format , sure , it may not be as efficient but everyone can program in perl and and use it . right ? phd a : but this is grad c : so , as opposed to phd a : i i 'm still , um , not convinced that you can do much at all on the text on the flat file that that you know , the text representation . e because the text representation is gon na be , uh , not reflecting the structure of of your words and annotations . it 's just it 's grad c : well , if it 's not representing it , then how do you recover it ? of course it 's representing it . phd a : no . you you have to what you have to do is you have to basically grad c : that 's the whole point . phd a : y yeah . you can use perl to read it in and construct a internal representation that is essentially a lattice . but , the and then phd d : yeah . grad c : well , that was a different point . phd a : right . grad c : right ? so what i was saying is that phd a : but that 's what you 'll have to do . bec - be grad c : for perl if you want to just do perl . if you wanted to use the structured xml query language , that 's a different thing . and it 's a set of tools that let you specify given the d - ddt dtd of the document , um , what sorts of structural searches you want to do . so you want to say that , you know , you 're looking for , um , a tag within a tag within a particular tag that has this particular text in it , um , and , uh , refers to a particular value . and so the point is n't that an end - user , who is looking for a query like you specified , would n't program it in this language . what you would do is , someone would build a tool that used that as a library . so that they so that you would n't have to construct the internal representations yourself . phd f : is a see , i think the kinds of questions , at least in the next to the end of this year , are there may be a lot of different ones , but they 'll all have a similar nature . they 'll be looking at either a word - level prosodic , uh , an a value , grad c : mm - hmm . phd f : like a continuous value , like the slope of something . but you know , we 'll do something where we some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort o uh , either at the word - level or at the segment - level , grad c : right . phd f : or or something like that . they 're not gon na be at the phone - level and they 're no not gon na be at the frame - level when we get done with sort of giving them simpler shapes and things . and so the main thing is just being able well , i guess , the two goals . um , one that chuck mentioned is starting out with something that we do n't have to start over , that we do n't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions , grad c : right . phd f : and being able to at least get enough , uh , information out on where we condition the location of features on information that 's in the kind of file that you put up there . and that would that would do it , grad c : yeah . i think that there are quick and dirty solutions , phd f : i mean , for me . grad c : and then there are long - term , big - infrastructure solutions . and so we want to try to pick something that lets us do a little bit of both . phd f : in the between , right . and especially that the representation does n't have to be thrown away , grad c : um right . phd f : even if your tools change . grad c : and so it seems to me that i mean , i have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want , but if we use the atlas external file representation , um , it seems like it 's rich enough that you could do quick tools just as i said in perl , and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve , we can use the whole atlas inter infrastructure , phd f : yeah . i mean , that sounds good to me . grad c : which has all that built in . phd f : i i do n't so if if you would l look at that and let us know what you think . grad c : sure . phd f : i mean , i think we 're sort of guinea pigs , cuz i i want to get the prosody work done but i do n't want to waste time , you know , getting the phd a : oh , maybe phd f : yeah ? phd a : um grad c : well , i would n't wait for the formats , because anything you pick we 'll be able to translate to another form . phd a : well ma well , maybe you should actually look at it yourself too to get a sense of what it is you 'll you 'll be dealing with , because , um , you know , adam might have one opinion but you might have another , so grad b : yeah . phd f : yeah , definitely . phd a : i think the more eyes look at this the better . phd f : especially if there 's , e um you know , if someone can help with at least the the setup of the right grad c : hi , jane . phd f : oh , hi . the right representation , then , i you know , i hope it wo n't we do n't actually need the whole full - blown thing to be ready , grad c : can you oh , well . phd f : so . um , so maybe if you guys can look at it and sort of see what , grad b : yeah . grad c : sure . phd f : um i think we 're we 're we 're actually just grad c : we 're about done . phd f : yeah , wrapping up , but , um yeah , sorry , it 's a uh short meeting , but , um well , i do n't know . is there anything else , like i mean that helps me a lot , grad c : well , i think the other thing we might want to look at is alternatives to p - file . phd f : but grad c : i mean , th the reason i like p - file is i 'm already familiar with it , we have expertise here , and so if we pick something else , there 's the learning - curve problem . but , i mean , it is just something we developed at icsi . phd a : is there an is there an ip - api ? grad c : and so yeah . there 's an api for it . and , uh , phd a : there used to be a problem that they get too large , grad c : a bunch of libraries , p - file utilities . phd a : and so basically the uh the filesystem would n't grad c : well , that 's gon na be a problem no matter what . you have the two - gigabyte limit on the filesystem size . and we definitely hit that with broadcast news . phd a : maybe you could extend the api to , uh , support , uh , like splitting up , you know , conceptually one file into smaller files on disk so that you can essentially , you know , have arbitrarily long f grad c : yep . most of the tools can handle that . phd a : yeah . grad c : so that we did n't do it at the api - level . we did it at the t tool - level . that that most many of them can s you can specify several p - files and they 'll just be done sequentially . phd f : so , i guess , yeah , if if you and don can if you can show him the p - file stuff and see . grad c : sure . phd f : so this would be like for the f - zero grad b : true . grad c : i mean , if you do `` man p - file `` or `` apropos p - file `` , you 'll see a lot . grad b : i 've used the p - file , i think . i 've looked at it at least , briefly , i think when we were doing s something . phd a : what does the p stand for anyway ? grad c : i have no idea . grad b : oh , in there . grad c : i did n't de i did n't develop it . you know , it was i think it was dave johnson . so it 's all part of the quicknet library . it has all the utilities for it . phd a : no , p - files were around way before quicknet . p - files were were around when w with , um , rap . grad c : oh , were they ? phd d : mm - hmm . phd a : right ? phd f : it 's like the history of icsi . phd a : you worked with p - files . grad c : mm - hmm . phd f : like phd a : i worked with p - files . phd f : yeah ? phd d : i do n't remember what the `` p `` is , though . grad c : but there are ni they 're the quicknet library has a bunch of things in it to handle p - files , phd a : yeah . grad c : so it works pretty well . phd f : and that is n't really , i guess , as important as the the main i do n't know what you call it , the the main sort of word - level grad c : neither do i . phd d : probably stands for `` phil `` . phil kohn . grad c : it 's a phil file ? phd d : yeah . that 's my guess . phd f : huh . ok . well , that 's really useful . i mean , this is exactly the kind of thing that i wanted to settle . um , so grad c : yeah , i 've been meaning to look at the atlas stuff again anyway . phd f : great . grad c : so , just keep phd f : yeah . i guess it 's also sort of a political deci i mean , if if you feel like that 's a community that would be good to tie into anyway , then it 's sounds like it 's worth doing . grad c : yeah , i think it it w phd a : j i think there 's grad c : and , w uh , as i said , i what i did with this stuff i based it on theirs . it 's just they had n't actually come up with an external format yet . so now that they have come up with a format , it does n't it seems pretty reasonable to use it . but let me look at it again . phd f : ok , great . grad c : as i said , that phd f : cuz we actually can start grad c : there 's one level there 's one more level of indirection and i 'm just blanking on exactly how it works . i got ta look at it again . phd f : i mean , we can start with , um , i guess , this input from dave 's , which you had printed out , the channelized input . cuz he has all of the channels , you know , with the channels in the tag and stuff like that . grad c : yeah , i 've seen it . phd f : so that would be i directly ,"
