    "answer": "industrial designer : shall we uh also look if it 's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? that you do n't have to buy new batteries if every project manager : well , marketing : yeah . project manager : for that is it 's on one part it 's um it 's a good thing to recharge it marketing : maybe it 's more ex expensive . industrial designer : mm , yeah . project manager : maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . you have just put penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it 's an it 's it 's it 's very annoying . user interface : but is n't that expensive in the entire package ? industrial designer : but that 's already possible . marketing : yeah . project manager : i 'm not sure y i 'm not sure it 's if it 's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . because if it 's it 's uh useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you do n't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wan na watch tv now , you wan na be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour . industrial designer : yes . yes . okay . uh you could make a device , but i 'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , project manager : i think i have a nice idea . industrial designer : but it you 're the remote also can act as a recharger . so then you can choose , you have every decision . know what i mean ? project manager : not exactly uh . industrial designer : you can uh put in normal penlites , rechargeable penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire . marketing : hmm . yeah yeah . project manager : i think it 's uh it 's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the tv . could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . industrial designer : so but marketing : yeah , that 's g industrial designer : but i think that will cost a lot . project manager : i 'm not sure . industrial designer : uh a normal wire would be better . project manager : a what ? industrial designer : like a like a p_d_a_ , a hand-held . you can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , project manager : well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal industrial designer : you do n't need basic station . yes . project manager : or so you could put that on a tv for example . industrial designer : that is possible , that 's true . project manager : it could be very flat , could be very small . marketing : but which project manager : it 's a very small yeah , i 'm drawing it big now , but so you can put your remote on flat for example . and at the backside of remote just just just a little hole marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : for example um you just put it down , it recharges for example . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : i do n't think it 's very expensive . user interface : but again , is n't that too expensive ? marketing : yeah . user interface : 'cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station industrial designer : project manager : i 'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that 's what he r that 's that you that 's what you buy yourself . industrial designer : yes . i 'm going to try to find that out . i 'm not sure if there 's information available on this , project manager : it 's just an idea , we have to find out if it 's possible . industrial designer : but marketing : but user interface : and do people actually want that ? to pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ? marketing : yeah , they want to pay for it . project manager : do they want but they want a rechargeable one ? marketing : yeah . project manager : i 'm not sure , you should find out if it 's if rechargeable is important . marketing : th uh there was not a el ask esque project manager : yeah . industrial designer : hmm . these are uh comfort issues . so i think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort . marketing : but project manager : they want to pay for comfort ,"
