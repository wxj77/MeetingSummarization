    "answer": "professor d : mm - hmm . i guess one thing that might also be an issue , uh , cuz part of what you 're doing is you 're getting a a spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds . um , and so it might matter how fast someone was talking for instance . you know , if you if if if there 's a lot of phones in one second maybe you 'll get a a really good sampling of all these different things , and and , uh , on the other hand if someone 's talking slowly maybe you 'd need more . so i do n't know if you have some samples of faster or slower speech but it might make a difference . i do n't know . grad c : uh , yeah , i do n't i do n't think the ti - digits data that i have , um , i is would be appropriate for that . professor d : yeah , probably not . yeah . grad c : but what do you what about if i w i fed it through some kind of , um , speech processing algorithm that changed the speech rate ? professor d : yeah , but then you 'll have the degradation of of , uh , whatever you do uh , added onto that . but maybe . yeah , maybe if you get something that sounds that that 's does a pretty job at that . grad c : yeah . well , uh , just if you think it 's worth looking into ."
