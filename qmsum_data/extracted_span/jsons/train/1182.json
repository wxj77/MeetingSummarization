    "answer": "project manager : well hi everyone again . user interface : hello . industrial designer : hello . project manager : um like before we uh i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and so here we go . uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote user interface : designer . marketing : project manager : and um it is to send messages of course to the tv . it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . um . should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose . user interface : project manager : um marketing : and she was challenged on that point project manager : that 's right . user interface : yes . industrial designer : project manager : but uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue . she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that 's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . uh and of course a circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider . marketing : okay . project manager : she would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . the marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . she feels that 's really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : just the look like , the button part i 'll explain . industrial designer : yeah . uh so this is our what uh we have made . this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um and it 's it 's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so it is a uh uh a looks-wise it is beautiful . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh and also compact in shape . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . good . industrial designer : yeah , project manager : industrial designer : oops , sorry . marketing : you used to have all the buttons user interface : industrial designer : um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als marketing : oh that 's good , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : no , that 's nice and friendly . industrial designer : yeah because uh uh you 'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . marketing : mm-hmm . mm . project manager : mm-hmm , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and then um uh for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and it 's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and and the button button 's part uh will be explained by f francina . user interface : okay . marketing : okay . user interface : now the um we decided upon including certain features on our remote . now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it 's the led or l_e_d_ the infrared . project manager : mm-hmm , marketing : yeah , okay , mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : now uh we have included the switch on and off button . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : now we have included another feature that is the mute button marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : on the side of the model . then we have included one to nine buttons marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : for controlling the programmes the different channels . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . project manager : what kind of button ? user interface : menu button . project manager : menu ? uh menu th menu , uh one one . user interface : yes , menu marketing : menu button . user interface : at the centre marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness marketing : mm-hmm . of the screen . mm , mm-hmm . user interface : of this uh picture . we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button . marketing : the next channel in the numeric pattern , or user interface : no , swapping is if if example you 're you 're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . marketing : yeah , mm-hmm . mm . okay , okay . user interface : and at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user 's voice and then it 'll act accordingly . project manager : okay . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : so this is our proposed model . marketing : okay . user interface : now the marketing expert has to marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : tell , yeah . user interface : give her suggestion whether it 'll be sellable or it 'll be cost effective . industrial designer : marketing : okay , well um what what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , user interface : yes , yes . marketing : that you can really hold it in one h you do n't need two hands industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : and it 's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ? project manager : yes the buttons are all raised , right ? marketing : the buttons are all raised project manager : are raised , mm-hmm . marketing : and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you do n't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , project manager : right . or have two hands to operate it , yeah . marketing : i really like that . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : you really did a good job on that , my little designers . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : um and um i like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . that 's that 's a really good good thing . project manager : yes , and it sort of sticks up so that you really marketing : yeah , that 's great . project manager : you do n't have to g first go like oh yeah here it 's on and yeah , mm-hmm . industrial designer : hmm . mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : abs okay . marketing : the colour 's very attractive . um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute user interface : no , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . marketing : and these mm-hmm on both sides they 're mute ? user interface : yes , yes . marketing : so you can push either one ? okay . project manager : so if you 're left-handed or right-handed it does n't matter . marketing : and this brings the menu up on the screen ? user interface : pardon me ? this is the menu yes , yes . marketing : this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are user interface : a the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , marketing : okay . user interface : and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels . marketing : f f okay . user interface : scroll up or scroll down the channels . marketing : right , very good . uh it looks mm looks like something i can sell . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : okay and now i 'm supposed to project manager : well , i have one question marketing : yeah . project manager : uh will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? user interface : yes , it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . industrial designer : ah . yeah , definitely . project manager : will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and does n't have to first learn it user interface : yes , which can be easily recognised . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . yeah . marketing : good point because we need the symbols 'cause we 're going into an international market we ca n't have anything that 's language dependent . industrial designer : yeah of course , and also project manager : yeah . but anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn industrial designer : yeah . yeah we can text . marketing : symbols on it . mm-hmm , mm-hmm . industrial designer : text that we can have on the case itself , project manager : that 's right . industrial designer : we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm . user interface : and and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . marketing : mm , 'kay , mm . mm-hmm . user interface : a shell shape . marketing : for the snail , yeah , mm-hmm , project manager : right , mm-hmm . user interface : yes , yes . industrial designer : yeah . so it is marketing : we have the snail shell . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yes , snail shell . industrial designer : yeah , marketing : he goes right back into his shell . industrial designer : yeah shell . project manager : right . marketing : well you know i think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that user interface : mm-hmm . y yes industrial designer : yeah , of course , yeah . marketing : you know that would , that would really work . project manager : now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? marketing : so project manager : that 's really the voice recognition that 's really unusual marketing : i think voice recognition is our big selling point industrial designer : mm . mm-hmm . marketing : 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range . project manager : and then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . you know . marketing : uh well i think that everybody 's gon na say their remote control is practical . i think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance . project manager : colours . mm-hmm . marketing : we 're really gon na have the be the project manager : cutest . marketing : cutest remote control on the block . project manager : yeah . marketing : so i think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : i think those are the two things to push . the look and the voice recognition . they 're gon na be our two selling points . project manager : okay , now uh having said that marketing : i 'm supposed to make a little presentation , are n't i ? project manager : no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done . marketing : okay . project manager : now we 're gon na talk about financing . marketing : ah , but in my instructions i think it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something . project manager : well , there is a production evaluation . is that you ? marketing : yeah , that 's me . project manager : but that 's after the financing . marketing : oh , okay . project manager : see ? fi see ? marketing : sorry , sorry . mm-mm . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : project manager : um . okay , we had looks and voice recognition . okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is . okay uh energy source we say that 's battery , right ? marketing : that 's right . project manager : okay , now . so we i guess we use one . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : what ? t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . well , that 's nice . she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would it does n't work . hmm . marketing : can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? or project manager : oh , okay yeah , okay , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : let 's see . okay , one , okay . oh go away . um kinetic source so that 's in the energy source that 's all we need . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : uh electronics , simple chip on print ? is that 's what we 're using ? industrial designer : yeah , project manager : one of those ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : come on . okay , one . uh regular chip on print . no . that 's all we need , the one industrial designer : no . yeah . project manager : case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved . marketing : well . industrial designer : this is a user interface : single curve ? mm . marketing : i guess it 's double curved . project manager : double curved ? one of those ? marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : case materi s supplements . plastic we said , right ? user interface : plastic . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh wood , rubber ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : rubber , because we 're gon na have the soft buttons . project manager : uh but , yes but industrial designer : i think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material . project manager : that 's just for the case material , user interface : is this for the case ? yes . project manager : so special colours though , we having that , marketing : oh okay , the mm-hmm , mm ' kay . project manager : right ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and then we have to interface push buttons . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : scroll wheel , no . integrated scroll wheel , l_c_ display ? button . marketing : 'cause we did n't put the clock in it after all , right ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : uh , button supplement special colour ? user interface : speci yes project manager : special form ? user interface : yes d we do have special form . project manager : and special material , rubber , wood , yes . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . total seven point six whatever that means . industrial designer : uh , i think that 's the price . project manager : that 's the price . user interface : one two three four five six seven eight nine industrial designer : maybe it is it just n project manager : eight , eight point two . that 's user interface : nine points , okay , yes . project manager : eight point two , right ? so , we looks like we are well within budget . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay . i guess i should save this i suppose , huh ? marketing : yeah . project manager : oops . uh-huh huh huh . user interface : on the desktop . project manager : i just tried that . my documents , computer . my compu ah oh here it is , yes . industrial designer : ami should for project manager : okay , fine . save . okay good , so that 's the good news . we gon na be popular . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : project manager : um . so that uh i think financing was pretty simple . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation . marketing : okay , i 'll take my file down so you can bring it up . 'kay should be able to get it now . 'kay , why do n't you move just to the next slide right away . project manager : you wan na go to the next slide ? marketing : yeah right away . project manager : okay . marketing : okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we have n't thought of . user interface : okay . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : we ca n't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we do n't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we wo n't sell any . industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm . marketing : so we have to get some input from those people . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it 's good , we 're gon na get behind it and sell it . um , next slide please . okay , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i did n't want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we 've got that . the size is small , the colour 's bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we 'll have the soft buttons industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : and the way this is shaped , even though it 's gon na be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that 's nice . and functionality i put last on my list because people are n't going to use it before they buy it . industrial designer : marketing : so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that 's what people are gon na get in the store . user interface : fee selling . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : they do n't have a television in the store , they ca n't play with it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um so they 'll be our main selling points . so um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please . okay , so um the shape um i think is a a one . that 's really , really excellent shape . the size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these are n't i in how i feel . i think that it 's i think that it 's plenty small enough to sell but i think we 're sort of right the scale is one to seven . i think we 're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors . user interface : okay . marketing : and our colour i think is great . the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . and given um the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we 'd disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . user interface : okay . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : so i think that basically we 've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . project manager : um i just realised one thing . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and uh i do n't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . marketing : well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? project manager : eight , eight twenty , yes . industrial designer : eight twenty so marketing : and so we 've got we 've still got four euros to go to spend . industrial designer : we have um four euros , yeah project manager : i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty . marketing : mm-hmm . well um that 's project manager : but i mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so um we just have to beware of that . i mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : well as we know in today 's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so we 're just gon na have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . industrial designer : yeah , user interface : yes , yes . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , still . marketing : as we 've seen with so many of these kinds of products . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : i 'm sorry to interrupt then but i just uh recog i just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features , okay ? industrial designer : included , yeah . hmm , user interface : yeah mm . project manager : so to beware of that . you wan na go to this next slide , marketing expert ? marketing : uh , well i is n't this my last slide ? project manager : i dunno . marketing : maybe . project manager : yes it is . mm-hmm . marketing : go ahead . i think that was my last slide , yeah . um . mm okay . and i 'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . um and we 're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . i 'm sorry i 've um forgot to do that , um . project manager : why ? wh why you need that up ? marketing : hmm ? well because i ca n't remember what i put on there . okay . industrial designer : marketing : now i 'm supposed to see how long my leash is here . project manager : i think you can make it there . marketing : mm 'kay . you ready . so now we 're all supposed to say what we think . um okay so on shape i gave it a one . wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst . user interface : worse , okay . marketing : um what do you think the shape is ? one , okay , and be betsy ? project manager : yes i think uh shape is one . industrial designer : yeah , even my yeah , shape is one . marketing : okay , uh-huh one , okay . and how about on size ? on size project manager : you you gave it a four . marketing : i gave it a four , yeah , i feel it 's just average . project manager : um , i dunno . i think i would give it at least a two . marketing : okay . mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , even i think it is one . it 's quite small . marketing : okay . okay user interface : marketing : you 're the designer , of course you wan na give it a one . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : um and then how about how we doing on colour ? project manager : colour uh i marketing : colour , i gave it a one . i really like all those nice bright , warm colours . project manager : i i like the colours . one . user interface : one . yes . industrial designer : yeah , one . marketing : one , one , one , okay . and how about the feel ? taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand . project manager : uh , i think i would give it a two . marketing : okay , i gave it a three , two , user interface : i 'll give three . marketing : yeah ? three . industrial designer : uh maybe two , marketing : two , okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and the next is functionality where i i admit i was a little hard on our team here , but project manager : well it 's also you ca n't really try it out uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view marketing : yeah . mm-hmm . project manager : but um i 'll give it a three . marketing : okay . two , okay . industrial designer : uh three , mm-hmm . marketing : three ? okay . well , um . it looks like we 've got got ourselves a pretty good product . um the functionality 's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but um otherwise i think we 're we 're ready to go to go with this product . anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? project manager : uh . here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . um . is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? user interface : we can always improve , yes . industrial designer : maybe we can yeah , include some more buttons and uh um user interface : yes , features . industrial designer : yeah features . we can make the buttons few buttons smaller . uh i think they are quite big , so i think i i mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . if we want to have more features than that . marketing : mm-hmm . well then again if we 're gon na um do the speech recognition thing we 're gon there gon na be some buttons that are gon na have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , definitely . user interface : yes . voices . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : so that that 's where we 're gon na have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . industrial designer : yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons . user interface : yes . yes . marketing : and um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control . maybe we can put that all on one button . um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . project manager : y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : and maybe project manager : and that we still you know we probably ca n't , with this particular item , we probably ca n't just uh add a whole lot of more things . marketing : mm-hmm . no . project manager : uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we 're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? uh i think personally i think uh i 'm pretty happy . marketing : i 'm pretty happy with it too , yeah um , industrial designer : even i 'm happy . marketing : it 's something i think i can market . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? uh marketing : i think you 've done a good job , miss leader . user interface : yes , yes you 've done a good job . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , definitely . project manager : and i think team work i think was very very good , i think we really industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah i d i do too i think we worked well together as a team , yeah . mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and uh i think we are we happy with the means we used ? we used whiteboard , we did n't use digital p well digital pens i guess are these things . marketing : yeah maybe we could 've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah , user interface : whiteboard more , yes , yes . industrial designer : yeah , probably . marketing : we did n't use that enough . project manager : yes , we could . uh , it 's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it 's positioned so that it 's much better visible for everybody and i think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit . marketing : mm-hmm . and we used the slide because it was better positioned . project manager : yes , i think so , i think absolutely , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm i think that 's true mm-hmm . project manager : and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . um did we new did we find new ideas ? marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i think we did . industrial designer : yeah , many . marketing : i think we were we were very good , yeah , mm . project manager : i think we we did , uh in more than one respect and uh so i think we did very well here . marketing : mm-hmm . okay . project manager : are the costs within budget ? yes , yes . uh is the project evaluated ? yes . marketing : yes , yes . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um then celebration . marketing : celebration . user interface : cel celebration yes , yes . industrial designer : ah . marketing : today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : project manager : so i i thank you all very much . um , i think this was very good and um industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i think we did come up with a new product that 's uh feasible . feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : so , thank you . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : thank you . industrial designer : thank you very much . marketing : okay . watch i i have my cord behind you here . user interface : okay . marketing : okay . project manager : i always get it on here , but getting it off is industrial designer : do we do we have some time left ? uh you have user interface : they say it 's forty minutes . project manager : ah yes we have time later marketing : but we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished . project manager : but we do n't user interface : okay . industrial designer : oh , alright ."
