    "answer": "marketing : so it meant three , project manager : , then i would say two or three . marketing : okay . industrial designer : wait , what 's the scale , one to seven , right ? project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , one is high . user interface : one 's high-ish is n't it ? ah , okay so yeah , two or three . marketing : 'kay industrial designer : okay , it 's upside-down . marketing : let 's go with two point five then . project manager : user interface : marketing : okay , um control industrial designer : marketing : high tech innovation . project manager : well it has the wee jog-dial marketing : we had to remove project manager : but marketing : yeah , so we 've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial industrial designer : say it 's more project manager : i 'd go with three or four , marketing : 's good . industrial designer : medium , project manager : maybe three . user interface : three . industrial designer : but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing . marketing : okay , project manager : yeah about three , okay . marketing : three ? okay , um industrial designer : marketing : style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . industrial designer : lemon . marketing : i should n't have said colour , but just industrial designer : okay , the blue the blue colours and do n't re do n't actually represent the colour , project manager : well that 's kind of marketing : sorta . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : except for the b the the red button , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : they because for want of a marketing : okay . project manager : but the yellow , i mean it could be a lemon yellow colour , marketing : right . yeah , could be . yeah . industrial designer : yeah , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , project manager : could n't it ? industrial designer : but the button itself , the blue can be anything else . project manager : yeah . marketing : okay . okay so we 'll go two . user interface : project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah ? okay , and um design is simple to use , simple in features . project manager : well yeah , i mean it 's really basic looking is n't it ? marketing : f f yeah f fairly basic , project manager : i mean i 'd give that nearly a one . marketing : you guys think ? user interface : yeah one . industrial designer : yep , that 's fine . marketing : yeah , one ? okay . um , soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? we 've used mostly plastic in the end so it 's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . user interface : yeah i think it 's about five . marketing : five ? project manager : five ? that 's really low . user interface : yeah well we have to use uh plastic project manager : yeah i suppose mm 'kay . marketing : that 's user interface : so it 's probably gon na be industrial designer : yeah , company logo . marketing : could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? was that an option ? industrial designer : i think it 'll be cost prohibitive , user interface : i think i 'd probably increase the cost . marketing : it would cost more than plastic . user interface : we 've only got like what , ten cents left so industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay , logo , we 've got it in there , have n't we ? project manager : yep . gon na have that on the side , are n't we , like there or something ? marketing : huh . and um it 's within budget , yep . it is , is n't it ? user interface : yeah . marketing : okay , so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here ? project manager : out of forty nine , i guess . marketing : yeah , out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . we are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . project manager : 's pretty good . marketing : so it 's pretty good . translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . right ? project manager : uh yeah . marketing : i think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about project manager : twice that , marketing : about thirty one , project manager : about thirty one . marketing : and then invert that , it 's project manager : so yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent yeah . marketing : oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent . project manager : it 's pretty good . marketing : okay , good . that was just a little formality for us to go through . project manager : okay . marketing : yep , oh hundred pound pen . user interface : project manager : marketing : sorry alright . project manager : nobody saw it , honestly . marketing : no . industrial designer : the cameras did . project manager : is that you all have all finished , or marketing : yeah that 's that 's me . i did have one other um one other frame i thought , i mean i i d not knowing how we would deal with this information , i thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : it 's not something i need to p push through , but i thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : could our design involve a series of colours so that it 's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , i do n't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , i dunno the whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon . project manager : okay . marketing : it 's just discussion . i mean obviously we can just abandon this , it 's fine . i 'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do . project manager : right . marketing : um , yep so there . that 's all . project manager : okay , great um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am i ? i do n't know what your instructions have been . marketing : um , i think to record it and uh i have n't been asked to submit it yet . project manager : okay , marketing : yeah . project manager : uh just wondering if i need to include it in the minutes , user interface : project manager : because if you 're submitting it anyway then marketing : i will , yeah . project manager : okay great . industrial designer : it keeps getting too big . project manager : cool . um right , uh well next up then , because we 've done finance , is the project evaluation . industrial designer : 'kay i 'm i 'm listening i 'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so i 'm playing with the play-doh as well . project manager : oh right , okay . user interface : industrial designer : just in case you 're wondering , why is he still playing with the play-doh ? just about right user interface : industrial designer : l_e_g_o_ lego . user interface : my leg . project manager : right , okay . um well do you wan na um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , sorry , forgotten that . you got a different uh industrial designer : marketing : yep . i like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . project manager : oh yeah , they 're good are n't they , yeah . marketing : it 's really quick . project manager : right okay , marketing : to use . project manager : um yeah here we are . uh as a note we 'll do this alphabetically . um do you wan na start andrew ? marketing : sure , um so what is it you 're asking of me now ? project manager : i do n't know , just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them . marketing : or sort of our work on setting this up . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . well , is it uh okay i 'll just go through your system then . the the room uh is fairly institutional , but um the main thing is , i think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know , project manager : uh-huh . marketing : as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we 've gone through this , it 's not really the centre point of creativity , it 's more just a project manager : well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ? marketing : d debating yeah , yeah but that 's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know . project manager : but i do n't i do n't think it means the room as in this room . i think it means like you know marketing : oh , oh right right , oh right okay room for creativ project manager : yeah . marketing : oh right i just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room . project manager : room . oh yeah . marketing : no , of course , yeah . project manager : well i dunno do you th i think it means um i think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so marketing : sorry . huh . yeah . yeah i th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms i 'd say that actually there 's sort of a tease of creativity because we 're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but then i then we 're told okay use the co company company colours . so what do we do . we 're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , project manager : okay . marketing : so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual industrial designer : you feel like you 're caged within whatever y project manager : okay . marketing : yeah within the constraints industrial designer : it 's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . marketing : the project manager : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : the constraints do come in very fast . project manager : okay uh do you know what , marketing : yeah , yeah . project manager : actually let 's take each point and everybody discuss it , i think . marketing : so project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : so still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is craig . user interface : um i agree with his point it 's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , got ta cut everything out 'cause we do n't have enough money . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . i think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back . marketing : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . yeah , yeah . industrial designer : and i guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , i think that 's a very big thing , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and i think the fact that we 're wearing these things restricts marketing : yeah , sure . industrial designer : i feel it 'cause i wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right project manager : yeah . industrial designer : it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . marketing : yeah . new creativity . industrial designer : i feel like i 'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know . project manager : so you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or marketing : right . industrial designer : not not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the the gear project manager : yeah , but actual environment ? industrial designer : yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also restricts project manager : okay . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : very good . um what about leadership ? industrial designer : project manager : i do n't know if that means like , if i did a good job or something . industrial designer : project manager : i do n't really know . marketing : yeah , well well i mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement project manager : from like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ? marketing : yeah from and you as well i think , just sort of acting as team leader . project manager : okay . marketing : um yeah i think i think it 's industrial designer : excuse me . marketing : i think it 's good . i mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and industrial designer : project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : you know , innovative thought with . in in reality i think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within . and so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so project manager : uh-huh , okay . marketing : but it 's not bad leadership , it 's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . it turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free project manager : so you think maybe a little too controlling or industrial designer : marketing : yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt . industrial designer : i think controlling is not the right word , i think the interactions are very structured . marketing : yeah maybe not co confining . industrial designer : i think structure is probably what you 're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling . marketing : yeah . yeah , yeah . mm-hmm , mm-hmm . project manager : okay . industrial designer : i do n't think there 's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm , mm-hmm . industrial designer : but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : it does n't tell you , you know , some ways that you might wan na be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the project manager : okay . marketing : mm . mm-hmm , mm-hmm . yeah . project manager : okay , uh what about teamwork ? marketing : um did , you wan na comment craig ? user interface : uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would 've been a lot easier . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : i think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , marketing : fully agree . industrial designer : but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um it it does n't have a , you know , a messenger will go . marketing : project manager : did uh did you guys get the email i sent you ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : oh that 's alright . user interface : not just yet . project manager : i was wondering if that got there okay . marketing : yeah , got the email . industrial designer : okay . project manager : okay , um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they do n't support collaboration , i think that 's the word . marketing : yeah , in it mm-hmm , industrial designer : they do n't support the team working together , you know , marketing : mm-hmm , mm-hmm , project manager : oh right , okay . marketing : exactly . yeah , i mean if you industrial designer : they 're still very individual tools . marketing : yeah , i mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way i see this i is that it 's uh the the s the structure in which we 've we 've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation i i do n't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different , industrial designer : we had play-doh fun . marketing : but um yeah , but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let 's say um a design concept , and we sit here together and do it , project manager : yeah . marketing : well that 's what teamwork is . to s to say okay go off and do n't talk to each other , it 's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork . project manager : yeah . okay . marketing : um not that we have n't done i think the best we could have done . project manager : okay . marketing : i 'm not dissatisfied with it . project manager : right , uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ? industrial designer : no , not really . project manager : okay , um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ? um did anybody think anything was like really useful , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : anything was pretty un f unsupportive ? marketing : i think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing i would use all the time , but it 's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text . um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . i know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it 's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss project manager : mm-hmm . yeah . and point at ? yeah . marketing : and and and in a way everybody 's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we 're just we 're actually just each of us discussing something that 's in each of our own minds . it was n't until we had this here , you know , project manager : yeah . marketing : like at one point i peeked across and looked at craig 's paper and i 'm like , now i know what he 's thinking 'cause i saw his book . but the b the b whiteboard could 've actually been this kind of continuing um project manager : so do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ? marketing : think could be , yeah . industrial designer : i think um the the focus of it a lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : and i think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things i think . marketing : yeah . yeah , yeah . industrial designer : it will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the powerpoint , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : or maybe the whiteboard and the powerpoint in the same place , marketing : yeah . yeah , yeah . industrial designer : you know in the centre of the project manager : okay . marketing : yeah , because the powerpoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas i can imagine if i 'd been encouraged to use paintbrush , for example , or whatever , i would 've actually used it , project manager : alright . marketing : um 'ca you know , just 'cause that 's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time . project manager : okay uh industrial designer : i think that there were too many powerpoints in the meetings . 'cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that . project manager : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and a lot of the information on the powerpoints , i do n't think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , project manager : yeah . marketing : no , not quite . industrial designer : especially my slides , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i felt that they just you know marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : as opposed to having to present them . marketing : yeah . project manager : what about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ? industrial designer : yep clunky . marketing : sure , yeah . user interface : oh they 're a bit clunky . industrial designer : agreed . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . yep . project manager : clunky , okay . um industrial designer : having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , 'cause you 're half way through a thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump . project manager : yeah . i know , i think at the very start of today i like wrote a whole load of stuff , did n't click note on one , marketing : yeah . project manager : then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so i 'm quite worried that i 've just written over the top of it or something , marketing : hmm . hmm . mm-hmm , mm-hmm . project manager : but they 'll have my paper anyway um and have n't done that since . industrial designer : but i think the pen is v is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we do n't have to worry . project manager : yeah , marketing : mm-hmm , industrial designer : so i think the pen 's good . project manager : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . industrial designer : it 's about the best thing . marketing : user interface : marketing : and o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually did n't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . project manager : yeah . marketing : it just occurred to me that they all industrial designer : yeah we only needed one computer and marketing : we only actually needed one computer . project manager : yeah , that 's true . marketing : if there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time . user interface : good point . industrial designer : and the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wan na have the urge to check something , you know , marketing : yeah . yeah . yeah . industrial designer : it 's useful but project manager : yeah . marketing : project manager : do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ? industrial designer : i think too many computers are just distracting . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um project manager : okay . i know i i like to have things written down in front of me actually , like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me i ended up you know like writing down there or something so i could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , marketing : mm-hmm . yep . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : um i do n't know about anybody else . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um what else uh any wh i do i 'm not really sure what they 're looking for when they say new ideas found . um i do n't know is user interface : is this for the project or project manager : could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ? marketing : well , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . project manager : mm . yeah if we just had uh marketing : so , that 's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , well you know it 's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you 're told you must now work away from your team . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah i i dunno i think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about marketing : oh yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : the only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , i thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah . marketing : mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . project manager : i really thi i i think maybe if we 'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : just to have like something written down , just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings , but marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : there you go . um so in closing , i have n't got my five minutes to go . thin oh there it i five minutes to go . user interface : project manager : wonderful . okay um are the costs within the budget , yes they are . and is the project evaluated , yes it is . so now celebrate . marketing : great . user interface : industrial designer : and we have ninja homer . marketing : so it so now we user interface : oh yeah . industrial designer : project manager : well apparently now i write the final report . what are you guys doing now ? user interface : do we know what the other ones are ? industrial designer : marketing : i i do n't know . project manager : you dunno ? user interface : oh wow . project manager : that is lovely . user interface : hey yeah , i said ninja homer . marketing : what did you call it ? industrial designer : ninja homer . see it looks like homer simpson marketing : huh , huh . industrial designer : but it 's electronic so it 's made in japan . project manager : so is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ? marketing : logo . user interface : industrial designer : yeah it 's just a logo . project manager : just a logo and then like ninja homer , industrial designer : ninja homer . project manager : right okay . industrial designer : the the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wan na print on the side of it . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i think it 's quite nice . marketing : fashion technology or something . industrial designer : you can wear homer , you can throw homer when you 're frustrated , doh . marketing : hmm , hmm , hmm . user interface : project manager : oh no , that 's cool , it 's got i 'm kind of industrial designer : it 's clunky . project manager : i 'm slightly gutted that we could n't get plastic and rubber , i think that would have been nice . marketing : yeah , yeah . project manager : ah well , maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : oh , i did learn something new , play-doh is useful . no it is it is . project manager : play-doh s marketing : industrial designer : it is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . marketing : huh . huh . industrial designer : 'cause like you say , it 's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . project manager : really ? marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : like we were playing with the play-doh and the ideas came with the play-doh rather than with everything else . project manager : did they ? industrial designer : you might wan na write that down . it 's just , i 'm just fiddling with the play-doh , and i 'm going yeah yeah it 's kinda cool . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . play-doh . marketing : no , it 's true , yeah . user interface : guess i 'd forgot how good s play-doh smells . project manager : yeah , it smells funny does n't it . um marketing : hmm . and some play-dohs are actually i think edible are n't they ? industrial designer : no , all play-doh is edible . project manager : yeah like the stuff for user interface : i think they 're all non-toxic 'cause it 's aimed for like two-year-olds . project manager : i think it has to be , yeah . industrial designer : it 's just wheat , it 's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh project manager : yeah um so to marketing : wow , hmm . project manager : wha what are your summarising words about play-doh ? industrial designer : it 's helpful to the creative process . um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and it helps you to understand marketing : taste . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : dimension as well . i think that that 's very helpful because it it starts to pop up , project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : whereas on a piece of paper , on a computer , on a board , um even with a three d_ graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of project manager : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm , yep . yeah . yeah . user interface : it 's not very tangible . industrial designer : yeah tangible , that 's a nice word . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm , mm-hmm , industrial designer : it becomes tangible . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : tangible . okay uh industrial designer : project manager : mm . i do n't know if there 's anything else we needed to discuss . industrial designer : nope . project manager : that that 's about it really . just sit still i guess for a little while . marketing : do we retreat to our , to continue our industrial designer : i think we could probably do it here as long as we do n't collaborate . project manager : um marketing : r reporting or what i project manager : well i dunno . um i 'm sure the little uh the little thing 'll pop up any minute now . marketing : industrial designer : can we turn off the microphones ? project manager : yeah , yeah if the meeting 's over then yeah i guess so ."
