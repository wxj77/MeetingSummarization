the chair : the honourable minister . hon . steven guilbeault ( minister of canadian heritage ) : mr . chair , the government remains committed to maintaining the openness and transparency of our government during this challenging time . the government of canada , along with provincial and territorial governments , have implemented exceptional workplace measures to curb the spread of covid-19 , and to protect the health and safety of federal employees . these measures have had an impact on institutions ' abilities to respond to access to information and personal information requests , since most employees are now working from their homes . mr. john brassard : frankly , i 'm surprised that the answer is coming from that minister when the minister of infrastructure and communities is in the house , but i will ask this question . can the minister tell canadians who pierre lavalle is ? hon . steven guilbeault : treasury board secretariat has provided guidance to institutions to continue to make the best efforts to respond to access to information act and privacy act requests and to provide published content the chair : we 'll go back to mr. brassard . mr. john brassard : can the minister of infrastructure and communities tell us who pierre lavalle is ?

hon . catherine mckenna : mr . chair , i ca n't give you the exact months . he was the ceo of the canada infrastructure bank since the beginning , but let 's be clear : crown corporations work at arm 's length from the government and must have the chair : we 'll return to mr. brassard . mr. john brassard : can i ask the minister how well she knows her file : 50 % , 75 % or 100 % ? hon . catherine mckenna : mr . chair , that 's quite a condescending little comment . i 'd like to say that i know my file very well . what i know is that canadians want infrastructure built , they want it built across the country , in the member opposite 's riding and in ridings across the country . they want cleaner , healthier , more connected some hon . members : hear , hear ! the chair : we 'll go back to mr. brassard . mr. john brassard : how much of the $ 35 billion of infrastructure money that was allocated to that bank has been spent so far ? hon . catherine mckenna : mr . chair , the infrastructure bank is a new , more flexible financing model for infrastructure investments . it was set up ; it is now in its new phase . we 're very excited that it 's going to be moving forwardand stay tuned . mr. john brassard : in the context of mr. duclos ' advice to his cabinet colleagues about openness and transparency , i 'd like to ask the minister how much mr. lavalle was paid annually . hon . catherine mckenna : mr . chair , as i said , crown corporations work at arm 's length from the government . our government follows the privacy act and the access to information act when it comes to employee compensation , but remuneration ranges are publicly available . i 'd note that this information for the bank 's ceos has been in the public domain the chair : mr. brassard . mr. john brassard : mr . chair , i 'm asking the minister how much mr. lavalle made . there was no answer to that . if it is in the public realm , she should know that . she said she knows her file very well . how much of a bonus was mr. lavalle paid recently when he left on april 2 ? hon . catherine mckenna : mr . chair , i am not involved in hr discussions when it comes to the canada infrastructure bank and mr. lavalle . crown corporations work at arm 's length from the government . they need to have flexibility to meet their commercial mandates . as i say , the information about salary ranges is publicly available , but personal hr the chair : mr. brassard . mr. john brassard : mr . chair , could you stop my ... ? i 'm hearing ... . the chair : i would ask those of us virtually to mute . mr. brassard , there is about 15 seconds left . i 'll cue you for a very short question . mr. john brassard : thank you , mr . chair . according to a table , mr. lavalle could have received a bonus after year one of zero to 75 % of his base salary , which was $ 510,000 to $ 600,000 per year ; or in year two , which he was in , zero to 120 % of his base salary . how much of a bonus did he receive ?"
