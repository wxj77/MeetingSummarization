    "answer": "project manager : yep . soon as i get this . okay . this is our last meeting . um i 'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . uh and then we 'll have a , the prototype presentation . um then we will um do an evaluation . uh or we 'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we 'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . um then we 'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we 'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . um let 's see , minutes from the last meeting . um we looked at uh the the trends . we had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . it was twice as important as anything else . um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . um and a spongy feel . so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . um looking at other other devices . um the ipod , we really liked the look of that . um we also had uh the kid 's remote for a simple idea . um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . but i think we 've still decided not to go with that . then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . so i 'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over . user interface : the prototype discussion . project manager : the prototype yeah . do you need a this ? user interface : no . project manager : okay . industrial designer : can try to plug that in there user interface : there is our remo the banana . marketing : industrial designer : but user interface : um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it 's basically designed around a banana . project manager : user interface : um but it would be held in such a fashion , marketing : user interface : where it is , obviously it would n't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . these would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . so that 's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . you have to use your imagination a little bit . and this here represents the screen , where you , where you 'd go through . project manager : very nice . user interface : and the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an ipod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . volume up and down . and then to access the more complicated functions you 'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . it 's that that simple . that just represents the infrared uh beam . that 's a simple on and off switch . um i do n't know , we could use the voice . t that blue bits should be yellow , that that 'd be where the batteries would be i suppose . and um that 's about it . it 's as simple as you , we could make it really . industrial designer : right . user interface : is there anything you want to add ? industrial designer : that 's what we have there . that 's plastic . plastic covered with rubber . we might uh add some more underneath here . maybe give it , give it a form . i mean you 're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so yeah , user interface : does n't make much make much difference . industrial designer : you have some rub yeah . user interface : you could work left-handed or right-handed i suppose . industrial designer : exactly , use both . might as well think about user interface : t the actual thing might be smaller . industrial designer : th think about the button as well . like either put either one one on either side or user interface : yeah . project manager : what but what 's that button ? industrial designer : not do it at all . it 's a quick on-off button . user interface : just the on and off . project manager : uh , 'kay . industrial designer : that 's um marketing : industrial designer : yeah i think it 's pretty important . so you do n't have to fiddle with that . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : right ? um that 's not um project manager : industrial designer : i 'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . you wan na play with that over there . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : there you go . user interface : it 's you know it 's flimsy 'cause it 's made out of heavy play-doh , marketing : project manager : would you like to uh industrial designer : right . user interface : but marketing : pretty impressive . project manager : well done . user interface : marketing : kind of a banana . user interface : and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything i suppose . with the scroll and the lcd . project manager : well luckily we are going to find out . or not luckily . um do you have a marketing presentation for us . industrial designer : marketing : i do . okay . you guys are gon na help me do an evaluation of the criteria . um . okay . so first i 'll just discuss some of the criteria that i found . just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier . and then we 'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . um so the criteria we 're gon na be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . so we 're gon na be doing it based on a seven point scale . and one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . with seven being false , we did not achieve that . . okay . so for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? industrial designer : . user interface : project manager : i think it 's definitely different than anything else out there . user interface : yeah . project manager : so if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes i would say , i would say most definitely . marketing : user interface : i would . project manager : it 's bright . user interface : it 's bright . it 's project manager : it still has your traditional black . user interface : it 's curved . it 's not there 's no sharp industrial designer : user interface : angles to it . project manager : yep , not angular . industrial designer : i 'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that 's definitely more beautiful than your average . marketing : industrial designer : however the colour , we do n't have a say in that . marketing : yeah i think the colours detract a little bit . user interface : some people might say it . yeah . industrial designer : that has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . so uh to answer that honestly i would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . project manager : yep . marketing : that 's true . yeah . project manager : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : 's nothing you can say about that . i mean i much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but project manager : yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form . industrial designer : right . right . it 's different . you do n't want your uh three feet huge lcd dis display in your living room that 's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . marketing : um okay so , do you think , since we this was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : does that sound good ? project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : what do you think ? three ? four ? project manager : i would say marketing : five ? project manager : four . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : four is fair . okay . project manager : very non-committal , four . marketing : okay , the second one . did we make it simple for new users ? industrial designer : it 's very intuitive , i think yeah . user interface : yeah . i think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . industrial designer : s give it a one . project manager : yeah . marketing : 'kay . okay . um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? user interface : uh yeah . 'cause we 've we 've brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume . marketing : i 'd say that project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : right . user interface : and then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . project manager : s scrolling through and selecting a few . industrial designer : right . so that 's a one . marketing : so one ? project manager : i think that 's a one . marketing : yeah ? okay . okay um the fourth one . how about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? one of the number one complaints . industrial designer : something that big and that yellow you just do n't lose anymore . project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : whether you want to or not , you 're not gon na lose it . user interface : it 's bright yellow . industrial designer : user interface : bright yellow 's hard to lose . but um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . that , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . that was what we 'd we 'd mentioned . project manager : so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could user interface : just just to use , to find it when it was lost . but like i said , like i do n't think you 'd lose something so yellow so easily . industrial designer : oops . hmm . user interface : and it 's not gon na fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . that 's gon na be a difficult shape to industrial designer : well what project manager : and it is quite bright and user interface : yeah . marketing : user interface : maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? project manager : uh marketing : okay . user interface : i mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , i mean a million ways . project manager : yeah . user interface : you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you 've lost it . marketing : that 's true . project manager : but if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit i think . industrial designer : oh yeah . you probably user interface : yeah . project manager : probably two . you know . if we eliminate the fact that you know it 's impossible to guarantee that it 's not gon na be lost then user interface : yeah . project manager : i 'd say two . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : with the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : y you could add an extra feature actually . which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we could add that but that 's nothing we have thought of so far . project manager : which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a user interface : yeah true . but i mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . they 're cheap . marketing : annoying alarm or something ? project manager : industrial designer : it 's it 's marketing : yeah . user interface : so it ca n't be that industrial designer : um the it 's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , user interface : expensive . project manager : some sort of proximity user interface : yeah . industrial designer : where you have one piece that 's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . that ca n't cost much . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your tv and the other user interface : stick it on the tv . project manager : pray that you do n't accidentally lose that piece . industrial designer : right . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : that 'd be tough then . well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : so . are we adding one of these two features ? industrial designer : let 's add one of those features and say yes . marketing : gon na say okay . project manager : okay . marketing : so we 're back to a one ? or a two ? two , 'kay . okay . are we technologically innovative ? industrial designer : uh user interface : i 'd say so . industrial designer : user interface : uh do n't get many mo remote controls with industrial designer : it 's all just user interface : screens on . industrial designer : it 's all just stolen technology when it comes down to user interface : yeah it 's stolen technology . marketing : from ipod yeah . project manager : it 's user interface : but we have . project manager : but there 's not a lot of yellow , there 's not a lotta yellow . marketing : but for remotes yeah . project manager : course that was n't really industrial designer : right right . project manager : we were kinda forced to take that colour . marketing : two ? three ? user interface : 'cause it 's stolen . project manager : i do n't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . user interface : no maybe not . industrial designer : yeah not really . marketing : but how many remotes do you see like this ? user interface : project manager : if we added the screaming factor then we go up . industrial designer : marketing : not so many . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : project manager : um i would say we 're probably at four . industrial designer : right . marketing : really ? okay . that 's gon na hurt us . user interface : marketing : okay . um spongy material ? industrial designer : yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . project manager : we have some spongy , yeah . user interface : yeah as much as as needed , i think . marketing : 'kay . industrial designer : it 's not a one though . one would be the whole thing project manager : yeah . because it 's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back . industrial designer : to fold and stuff . yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so that 's a four at most . project manager : probably a four at most . possibly even a five . marketing : and lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ? project manager : industrial designer : y yes . user interface : yeah . marketing : i 'd say we did . project manager : if your fashion is b is carmen miranda , you betcha . industrial designer : more user interface : yeah . marketing : industrial designer : well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the lcd and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , user interface : on the project manager : it 's true . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but it definitely is user interface : be what we were told , and they 'd say yeah , definitely . industrial designer : . marketing : 'kay . alright . now we just got ta calculate . six eight twelve sixteen . seventeen divided by s user interface : . project manager : seven is marketing : eight . project manager : two point marketing : project manager : two point four ? user interface : is that some long division ? no . project manager : something . marketing : well i have n't done math in years . industrial designer : marketing : what two user interface : marketing : i dunno . user interface : just , i 'm sure there 's a . marketing : okay we 'll say two point four two . right ? how does that look ? industrial designer : i 'm impressed . i ca n't do that without a calculator . user interface : no i ca n't do long marketing : it 's been a while . user interface : very impressive . project manager : and what what is the acceptable criteria ? is there like a scale that we have to hit ? marketing : oh no . they just told me to industrial designer : marketing : pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically . project manager : alright then . marketing : so that 's that . project manager : okay . well , let 's see . marketing : project manager : now we get to do the budget numbers . you did n't know that you were gon na have a budget . but we do . okay . user interface : yeah . yeah so . you 'd been going a long time dividing that . it 's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . marketing : oh my god . user interface : two point four two basically . marketing : okay . yeah we 'll go with that . project manager : so i have here an industrial designer : fifty percent , you 're kidding . marketing : not too shabby . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : p project manager : we want a fifty percent profit on this . oh you ca n't really see that very well . user interface : charge about three hundred quid for it . project manager : twelve and a half euros is what supposed to cost us . okay , so industrial designer : it 's too much . project manager : well let 's see . industrial designer : um project manager : the f the wonder if i can make this industrial designer : uh project manager : what the oh it wo n't let me do that . okay . alright so at top , i do n't know if you guys can read that or not . i ca n't 'cause i do n't have my glasses on , industrial designer : project manager : but so we 've got the energy source . there 's uh four , five , six categories . industrial designer : battery . project manager : we have energy source , electronics , case . then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . okay so uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? user interface : project manager : probably some e either two or four . two ? like it . industrial designer : at four it 's gon na be too heavy , so that that 's not our problem . people can change it every month . project manager : excellent . industrial designer : they wo n't know until after they bought it . user interface : marketing : project manager : this is consumerism . industrial designer : project manager : alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker . industrial designer : . user interface : we 're advanced chip are we ? industrial designer : that 's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . project manager : 'kay , we have one of those . 'kay then the case is a probably it 's double curved . industrial designer : double curved , yes . project manager : case materials are industrial designer : plastic . project manager : plastic . um i guess it 's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . industrial designer : n no . project manager : is that right or is it just one ? industrial designer : no that 's just one . project manager : maybe it 's one because of the industrial designer : it 's just one mo single mould , we can do that . project manager : 'kay . user interface : yeah yeah . marketing : right . project manager : i guess it does n't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . industrial designer : exactly , right . project manager : special colour ? industrial designer : that 's not a special colour . it 's a specially ugly colour , but it 's not special . marketing : bright yellow . project manager : interface type . we have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an lcd display . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : s user interface : that 's yeah . project manager : so we actually have the lcd display marketing : user interface : and then project manager : and then is it the integrated or is it user interface : i 'd say the integrated . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yes unfortunately . project manager : 'kay . button supplement ? special colour ? um special form ? special material . industrial designer : we could of course make the buttons wood . project manager : user interface : marketing : industrial designer : say mahogany or so marketing : it 'd look really lovely . project manager : or titanium . industrial designer : mm-hmm or titanium . project manager : they cost us all the same . marketing : yeah . user interface : remote control . project manager : well we only have one button so really we should n't be charged , industrial designer : uh just marketing : industrial designer : project manager : we should n't be charged anything for the the button supplements . user interface : no that 's getting a bit tiny . project manager : um user interface : yeah . marketing : user interface : i 'd ignore that . marketing : leave it blank . project manager : okay . we 're gon na leave that one blank because we run on a lcd and scroll . so our total is fifteen point five . which i believe is industrial designer : yeah that 's too much . project manager : by three euros over . industrial designer : it 's hard to believe . so we 'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? project manager : user interface : marketing : project manager : so the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . user interface : if it w what if we completely took out the the one single button we 've got on . marketing : industrial designer : user interface : and just had a scroll wheel interface . and the lcd display . i suppose the lcd c_ display 's the one that 's pushing it up a bit though . project manager : yeah 'cause the marketing : project manager : well 'cause we have to have both right ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i mean let 's let 's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so s yeah let 's take away the user interface : yeah you could maybe take out the lcd dis display even , industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the tv itself . industrial designer : right . project manager : so we may not need the lcd display ? user interface : uh that is possible yeah . industrial designer : right . we may not need it . there you go . project manager : well there we go . industrial designer : perfect . project manager : twelve point five . user interface : there we go . marketing : perfect . project manager : okay . so we just remove our marketing : industrial designer : user interface : screen . marketing : project manager : screen here . user interface : make it a bigger dial . industrial designer : user interface : easier to use . even easier to use then . project manager : industrial designer : okay , the user interface : marketing : project manager : besides look at what the lcd does to our lovely remote . user interface : marketing : project manager : back to the design room boys . industrial designer : so we can just take away a heck of a lot of the marketing : user interface : marketing : . industrial designer : there you go . central ? marketing : what 's the blue part ? user interface : that was just industrial designer : oh that 's just user interface : we ran out of yellow . marketing : oh that 's the batteries . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : there you go user interface : there you go . industrial designer : . oops . user interface : even simpler . marketing : looks more like a banana . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : there you go . user interface : for all those fruit lovers out there . industrial designer : one more criteria . project manager : marketing : project manager : okay so the costs under twelve point five euro . was no . we redesigned it . now it 's yes . user interface : yeah . marketing : project manager : next slide . project evaluation . uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . um so i guess that let 's see here . i think that perhaps the project evaluation 's just supposed to be completed by me . but i 'd like to hear your thoughts . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : fair enough . user interface : marketing : trying to fill in some time there . project manager : uh h what did you think of our project process ? industrial designer : great . user interface : i think we did yeah i think we did quite well . um industrial designer : yeah . project manager : good . marketing : good teamwork . industrial designer : just half a day , you have a remote . there you go . user interface : yeah . right from the start of the day . project manager : yeah i think user interface : we sort of knew where we were going straight away i thought . project manager : we st we started off a little little weak . our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . marketing : project manager : um um marketing : project manager : but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . um room for creativity ? there was that . um i think we tried a lotta different things and um i think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . um you guys worked together well as a team . and um the means ? which was the whiteboard and the pens . user interface : yeah . we 've used the whiteboard . industrial designer : super super . project manager : i had some problem with the pen i think , but minus your p marketing : minus your powerpoint fiasco . industrial designer : well that 's not my fault . that 's obviously the people i work for uh that work for me , marketing : no i know . i 'm project manager : well marketing : yeah . incom industrial designer : uh they 've just you know user interface : project manager : have a industrial designer : heads are gon na roll , believe me . project manager : we have a list of employees that you would like fired . user interface : marketing : user interface : industrial designer : yes yes . project manager : okay . n new ideas found ? um industrial designer : marketing : mm . kinda . project manager : yes for the remote . maybe no not f for user interface : technology used . project manager : technology . alright . closing . costs are within the budget . project is evaluated . um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . that 's it . user interface : excellent . project manager : and i still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . marketing : project manager : actually . um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . and then we 'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . marketing : we might have a while though . industrial designer : ."
