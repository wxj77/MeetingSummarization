    "answer": "phd i : and and and , uh , one of the obvious things that occur to us was that we 're since we now have thilo 's segmenter and it works , you know , amazingly well , um , we should actually basically re - evaluate the recognition , um , results using you know , without cheating on the segmentations . phd e : so phd i : and , that should be fairly phd e : and how do we find the transcripts for those so that ? yeah . the references for for those segments ? phd i : oh , ok . so , there 's actually phd e : it 's not that phd i : why do you ask ? grad f : i could phd i : no , actually , um , nist has , um m a fairly sophisticated scoring program that you can give a , um a time , grad f : hand ones . phd g : well phd i : uh you know , you basically just give two time - marked sequences of words , and it computes the um the , { comment } uh { comment } you know , the the th phd b : it does all the work for you . phd i : it does all the work for you . phd b : yeah . phd i : so , it we just and we use that actually in hub - five to do the scoring . um . so what we 've been using so far was sort of a simplified version of the scoring . and we can we can handle the the the type of problem we have here . phd e : so , basically you give some time constraints for for the references and for for the hypothesis , phd i : so , we ha yeah . right . phd e : and yeah , ok . phd g : yeah . phd i : right . phd g : maybe the start of your speech and the end of it , or stuff like that . phd i : right . it does time - constrained word - alignment . so . so that should be possible . i mean that should n't be a problem . uh , so that was the one thing , and the other was that , um what was the other problem ? oh ! that thilo wanted to use the recognizer alignments to train up his , um , speech detector . phd e : yeah . phd i : um , so that we could use , uh you know there would n't be so much hand labelling needed to , uh to generate training data for for the speech detector . phd e : yeah . i 'm just in progress of of doing that . so ."
