    "answer": "lynne neagle am : okay , good morning , everyone . welcome to the children , young people and education committee . we 've received no apologies for absence . can i ask members whether there are any declarations of interest , please ? no . okay . thank you . item 2 this morning is our evidence session with the cabinet secretary for education for our inquiry into the status of the welsh baccalaureate qualification . i 'm very pleased to welcome kirsty williams am , cabinet secretary for education ; kevin palmer , who is deputy director , pedagogy , leadership and professional learning ; and andrew clark , deputy director , further education and apprenticeships division . so , thank you all for attending , and we 're looking forward to hearing what you 've got to say . if you 're happy , cabinet secretary , we 'll go straight to questions . kirsty williams am : of course . lynne neagle am : and the first questions are from julie morgan . julie morgan am : thank you very much , chair , and bore da . i was going to ask some general questions about the value of the baccalaureate . could you give us your views on how the welsh bac is valued by learners and teachers ? kirsty williams am : bore da , julie , and thank you very much for your question . firstly , i 'd like to begin by saying that i as the cabinet secretary value the qualification very much indeed . i believe that it helps ensure that we are able to give our young people in wales a broad and balanced curriculum , recognising the need to develop knowledge and skills in core subjects but recognising also that the purpose of education is to help prepare our children for further study and the world of work , and i believe that the skills challenge element of the baccalaureate does just that . i meet with young people and teachers all the time who tell me about the positive experiences they have had studying for the welsh bac , and much of that was evidenced in qualifications wales 's review into the welsh baccalaureate . they did focus group work with a representative sample , and many of the learners expressed the fact that they have enjoyed studying for the qualification and have gained a great deal from it . i meet regularly with individuals who have been able to use their bac to successfully gain a place at university , so i believe there 's a huge value for welsh young people being able to study this particular qualification alongside the more traditional qualifications that perhaps we 're all used to . i think the challenge is that , given that many people are very familiar with what a gcse is and , as parents , we will know what that is and many of us will have done\u2014some of us are so old we 'll have done o-levels . we know what those traditional qualifications look like , and therefore a new qualification\u2014there 's always a job of work to do to communicate that , if people are n't used to it , but i value it hugely . i think that , whilst there is always room for improvement\u2014and , of course , you 'll be aware of the review that qualifications wales undertook and that has suggested ways in which we can further improve and refine the qualification , but i think it is a valuable piece of work for welsh young people to undertake . julie morgan am : it 's great that you 've been around listening to learners and what they have said about it . have you had any negative feedback ? kirsty williams am : well , occasionally , of course , we do have concerns raised with us , and those concerns are similar to the ones that have been raised in the qualifications wales review . so , for instance , we sometimes have concerns about how some students balance the welsh bac with other qualifications they may be taking . some teachers feed back around the workload issues associated with the welsh baccalaureate . for some students , there may be concerns about the nature of the welsh bac and whether that can impact negatively on their well-being . and , obviously , that 's why qualifications wales have undertaken this piece of work so that we can refine , if necessary , that qualification and how we continue to look at how we ensure my belief that taking the welsh bac should be the norm for students but also recognising that , in some cases , there needs to be flexibility to ensure that the well-being of the student is not compromised . julie morgan am : and so would you say that it 's valued by learners more or less at key stage 4 or post 16 ? kirsty williams am : well , i think that , as i said , the vast majority of students i meet report very positively about the opportunities that are afforded for studying at that level . occasionally , we hear from students who i believe think that in studying the subject they may be compromising their chances because they want to do additional a-levels , and i 'm sure we 'll come on to , later on , whether universities , and whether the russell group universities in particular , value the qualification . but i feel that there are particular strengths . and i think what 's really important , and , in talking to universities , since the qualification became graded , rather than just a pass/fail qualification\u2014i think that added rigour since 2015 has been particularly important in ensuring that there 's real value in students undertaking that work . julie morgan am : and what about the effect that the leadership in the school has on the way that the bac is received ? have you\u2014 ? kirsty williams am : as always , julie , leadership is crucial , and students ' experiences can be very coloured by the attitude towards the teacher delivering that particular course . and , therefore , we need to continue , alongside the wjec and qualifications wales , to ensure that the welsh bac is communicated to children in a positive way , the benefits are explained to children and their parents , and , also , we need to ensure that those who are tasked with teaching welsh bac in their schools or colleges feel confident in their ability to do so and to ensure that students have a really positive experience of that qualification , because if you 're being taught by someone who is telling you , 'oh , i do n't know why we 're having to do this ' , then , obviously that 's going to colour how you feel about it . and , if i 'm honest , i recently attended a youth forum , where young people from the county were discussing all sorts of issues\u2014everything from the environment to their experience in school\u2014and i was struck by the group of year 12 and year 13 students . i specifically asked them about the bac\u2014i always take the opportunity to ask them about their experience of the baccalaureate . one school , the group of students said , 'it 's fantastic . we really enjoy it . it 's really valuable . i 'm learning a lot . ' students from a school seven miles away\u2014just seven miles away\u2014said , 'oh , i do n't know why we 're having to do this . ' and i suspect that that has got more to do with how that is being delivered in their institutions than it has about the quality of the qualification . so , we need to keep ensuring that those who are tasked with this see it as important , communicate that to students , and have the confidence and the ability to deliver a really positive experience . julie morgan am : i think our experiences in the committee are very similar . within the same room , actually , we 've had two completely different sets of views . so , what do you intend to do to try to ensure that there 's consistent support and enthusiasm for the bac from the leaders ? kirsty williams am : well , first of all , we have the design group of qualifications wales looking to address some of the issues that arose out of the report around ensuring that , especially from a teacher workload perspective , it 's not too onerous in terms of assessment . so , there 's that to do to make sure that we 're not asking children to duplicate and do things over and over and over again , which , of course , for any of us , would be wearing and we would question to the value of . so , there 's the design group looking at the qualification itself . we are ensuring , as part of our professional learning for teachers that\u2014 . there are existing opportunities via the regional consortia for support for teaching of the qualification . the wjec has resources and support available , but we will look , as we roll out our national approach to professional learning , at that the professional learning needs of those already in the system are addressed . of course , our accreditation for our new initial teacher education is predominantly addressed at being able to deliver the new curriculum , but , if you think about the elements of 'successful futures ' and the skills and the knowledge and the pedagogy associated with that , it 's very much in line with the welsh baccalaureate challenge certificate . so , actually , there are opportunities via initial teacher education as well , and we continue to need to look to work with our partners to be able to reinforce why this is a worthwhile qualification . and i have to say i think the best people to do that\u2014 . it 's not me . i 'd like to see past students of the welsh baccalaureate being able to talk about their own experiences and why it 's made a difference to them . i come across individuals for whom their place at university has been secured by that welsh baccalaureate , and , all of a sudden , if that 's what 's got you your place , it becomes a lot more valuable than perhaps it was six months before . we need to make sure that students are aware , and teachers and school leaders are aware , of the importance that this qualification has . lynne neagle am : suzy , did you have a supplementary ? suzy davies am : yes . i 've got one on it , but i 'll leave that one . i just want to go back to julie 's question about whether there was a different perspective or a different sense of value for students who are post 16 and those who are pre 16 . when one of the college leaders here was asked whether he had people coming to him in his fe college who 've been through the pre-16 bac and had heard evidence or had stories of , basically , those children cobbling together their bac in the last four weeks of term before they got there , he said that yes , that is his experience . does that worry you at all , because , of course , the whole purpose of bac is to teach skills over a period of time , and its purpose can not be fulfilled by getting it all done in the last term of\u2014which year am i in ? \u2014year 11 , in order to satisfy the curriculum ? kirsty williams am : yes . obviously , that 's not the experience that we would want young people to have , and , as someone who has had a daughter just finish year 11 , that 's certainly not the experience that my daughter had in her particular school , and i have another daughter who has just gone into year 10 , where the welsh bac has started in year 10 and it is a a two-year course in which elements are undertaken . obviously , we will need to address , as part of the design group and the work that qualifications wales is doing , how that is playing out in individual schools . but that would not be a positive experience ; we want this to be taken in exactly the same way as we would expect a gcse to be taught over a period of two years . but , andrew , i do n't know if there 's anything you 'd like to add from the college perspective . andrew clark : i think it is variable . i think that it will depend on the feeder schools to the colleges and it 'll depend upon the delivery models that are in existence in those schools . it 's been around as a qualification now for about a decade , i think . there have been differences in the way that the subject has been\u2014sorry , not the subject , the qualification has been delivered . and i think it 'll be helped by a recent review by qualifications wales , because they 're doing a survey at the moment as to different delivery models in different locations , and that , perhaps , will inform more even practice as we move forwards . suzy davies am : yes , and estyn and consortia are looking at it as well . i do n't want to cut across questions , so , thank you . andrew clark : no , but it 's a known issue , if you like , that various people are attempting to address and bring a more uniform mode of delivery across the nation . suzy davies am : okay , thank you . lynne neagle am : we 've got some more detailed questions now on understanding , from si\u00e2n gwenllian . sian gwenllian am : just to drill down rather deeper into the issue of the variability in the way in which the welsh bac is provided , could you explain why you think that this inconsistency is happening , and then what the impact of the inconsistency and variability is on the value that learners attach to the bac and their understanding of it ? kirsty williams am : i think the variability can be perhaps explained by the fact that it 's a new type of qualification , the fact that different schools have adopted it at different rates\u2014 sian gwenllian am : ten years ? kirsty williams am : well , as i said , over that time , there were some early adopters who have done it in a certain way , there are some people who 've come later to it , who may be doing it in a different way . and , as i said , it 's quite a different departure from traditional o-levels , from gcse-type subjects , where there is a programme of work and a syllabus . so , it is a different nature of qualification , and , therefore , as andrew has just alluded to , schools have approached it in a different way . we are alert to that and qualifications wales , crucially , is alert to that , and we are looking to ensure greater consistency in how it is delivered in individual schools . we 're also aware , in the school setting , in pre 16 , there are some concerns about the onerousness of the workload associated with the evaluation of the students ' work . now , clearly , there is a difference between onerous and rigorous . we wrote the qualification to be a rigorous qualification for the students , but we do n't want it to be jeopardised by the evaluation of it being too onerous . so , there 's that balance to be struck . again , that 's one of the issues that the design group and qualifications wales are looking at . that process is a really important process , so there is the design group , but working alongside the design group , who they are testing the messages and testing their thoughts with , is a stakeholder group , and there is also a practitioners group . so , that work by the design group is being tested with those people who have an interest : business , for instance , the world of work\u2014is this qualification really giving students the skills that are valued by potential employers ? \u2014but it 's also testing its thinking with the practitioners , those people who will be charged with the delivery of the qualification , and i think that 's really important to be able to get an understanding of the challenges of making sure there 's a consistency , and what are the barriers to that , and what steps need to be taken to ensure a greater level of consistency in delivery . sian gwenllian am : is there a correlation between consistency in general ? because we know that there 's polarisation in the secondary school sector between the good schools and the not-so-good schools . and is there a correlation between\u2014if the schools are good according to estyn , or excellent , are they also good , excellent at delivering the bac ? is it a fundamental inconsistency across the sector that 's causing this inconsistency ? kirsty williams am : i do n't know . i do n't have that data to hand , but , of course , from next year , the bac will be a dedicated performance measure for schools . so , actually , we will be looking specifically at completion of the bac as part of the wider set of school performance measures . so perhaps we will be in a better position once that 's formally established to be able to track progress . sian gwenllian am : because some of the evidence we 've heard is that if the leadership is good around the bac in the school , well , everything else follows from that . so , it makes sense to me that it could be . kirsty williams am : absolutely . as i said , i do n't have the figures to hand , but , as i said , from next year , the bac actually becomes a formal part of the performance measures for schools . sian gwenllian am : fine . i 'll turn , therefore , to the understanding of employers of the welsh bac and the skills challenge certificate . from the evidence that we 've had , it appears that there is a problem in this area , that is , employers generally do n't value the qualification . is that your experience , and how can we improve that ? how can we elicit more engagement from employers of all sizes with the value of the baccalaureate ? kirsty williams am : well , the first thing to say is my understanding of the development of the bac is that employers ' voices were reflected and they were part of the process that drew up the qualification in the first place . you 'll be aware of the review by qualifications wales that found that many employers say that the skills that are developed through the baccalaureate are exactly the kinds of skills that they want young people to be acquiring whilst at school , that put them in a good place for looking for employment later . i would agree with you , si\u00e2n , and not just in terms of the bac , there are lots of reasons why we need greater working between education and employers . i sit down with employer organisations to try and explore better ways in which we can work together\u2014everything from ensuring that children have work experience opportunities through to , for instance , what more some of our companies could do to take up governors ' roles , for instance , in our local schools , so that employer voice and that business voice are heard at a school management level . i think these things are really important . it 's something that 's sometimes difficult . there are some excellent examples of really good practice where local employers work really closely with schools . i think of sony in bridgend doing a really , really , really good job working with their local schools . in other areas , where you have n't got such a big employer , it can be difficult , ca n't it , for a small business that is trying to do their small business to think about , 'oh my goodness , i 've got to do something to help improve the education system as well . ' so , i 'm always looking at new ways in which we can get that working together . as i said , the qualifications wales design group has a stakeholder group that is helping them with their review into the qualification at the moment , but there are really good examples where employers and other organisations are working together . we also need to continue , i think , to communicate more clearly with employers the nature of the qualification . again , because it 's relatively new , and the brands of the gcse and a-level are so strong , people know what they are , unless you 've either done the welsh bac yourself or you have a son or a daughter , or a grandson or granddaughter who has gone through the process , you 're probably going to be less familiar , and we need to continue to work together with the wjec and qualifications wales as a government to better communicate the value of the qualification . sian gwenllian am : so , you agree that there is a specific piece of work that needs to be done around employers and that the government should be leading that . kirsty williams am : yes , and we are working closely with , as i said , qualifications wales to develop a joint communication plan , and we continue , as i said , as part of qualifications wales 's review into the nature of the qualification\u2014employers ' voices are being heard as part of that particular piece of work . but more generally , yes , i think there 's more that we can do to better engage employers with the education system in lots and lots of different ways . sian gwenllian am : okay . thank you . kirsty williams am : not just on the welsh bac . lynne neagle am : just before we move off this section , the variability that the committee has seen has been quite pronounced , really . we 've been to a school where they 've got a passionate and dedicated welsh bac school leader , but then we 've spoken to other schools where it 's tagged on to a variety of teachers ' roles , and that clearly has an impact on the way it 's being taught . you said in your answer to si\u00e2n that you 're trying to ensure more consistency in the delivery of it , and you referred to the performance measures ; are the performance measures the main vehicle by which you 're going to ensure consistency , or are you planning to issue any more guidance to schools on how it should be delivered on the ground ? kirsty williams am : we will need to reflect the work that qualifications wales is undertaking . professional learning , i think , has a role to play as well as performance measures . so it 's not just one thing that we can do that will change this , it is a number of things\u2014everything from the communications plan to making sure that teachers who find themselves responsible for delivering this feel confident and have had the professional learning opportunities to give them the skills so that they do a great job in delivering a positive experience to students . the performance measures , of course , as we know\u2014sometimes in schools , it is those that make schools focus on something . so there 's a wide variety of ways in which i think we can look to ensure more consistency . but , in the end , i think it is professional learning and teacher training , ite , that will make the biggest difference . lynne neagle am : okay . and just on understanding , one of the things the young people in crickhowell told us was that they thought the name should be changed . they felt that it was n't reflective of exactly what the qualification is and that maybe having something that was clearer would be better . is that something you 've considered ? kirsty williams am : well , first of all , i need to declare an interest , because that 's the school my daughter goes to , and i do n't know if she was the one\u2014 lynne neagle am : she was n't . angharad was n't there . kirsty williams am : she was n't the one who said that . certainly , i 'd have to reflect . my gut instinct tells me that one of the issues that we have is developing an understanding of the brand and what that qualification is , and if we move away from 'welsh bac ' and suddenly start to call it something else , i think that could be even harder and set us back from where we are . so , that 's not to dismiss it , and i would want to reflect on those views , but i think if one of the issues that we 've got is developing a better understanding of the qualification ; if we were to suddenly change the name of it , that might have the unintended consequence of making that job even harder . but , obviously , if the committee was to make a recommendation , we would\u2014i 'm happy to reflect on that evidence , but , as i said , my gut instinct would tell me that there could be an unintended consequence of moving away from that brand . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you . the next questions are from dawn bowden . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . you touched on this once or twice in answers to questions about how rigorous the qualification is . we 've had mixed evidence , i would suggest , from groups of stakeholders . we 've heard people say that the welsh bac has no rigour , that pupils are spoon-fed . we 've heard that the welsh bac is passively marked , the grades are inflated , that there 's little rigour in the sampling and moderation , there 's a confusion about how the scc is graded , and i know that 's something you talked about , actually , that introducing the grading system is improving the rigour . i suppose my question to you is : if the welsh bac is being seen in this way by stakeholders , how are going to address that ? to what extent is that a real problem ? kirsty williams am : i think making it a graded qualification has been really important , and i make no apologies for this qualification being rigorous\u2014no apologies for that at all . that 's how it should be , and that 's how you create value , by ensuring that a qualification is rigorous . what 's really important is that it 's not just me saying that it 's rigorous ; there is an independent process that benchmarks qualifications . the fact is that at advanced level\u2014because i do n't know if you 're making these observations about the pre-16 welsh bac , or whether we 're talking about the advanced level qualification\u2014that is the equivalent of an a-level . it 's been benchmarked against a-levels . it has a ucas tariff associated with it . it is used by universities as a means of qualification that gains entrance into a university in just the same way as an a-level is . so , therefore , i do n't have any concerns about the rigour of the qualification . in terms of spoon-feeding , one of the reasons why universities like the qualification is that it 's very difficult , for instance , in the individual project work to be spoon-fed . it is very demanding of individual students , and it 's very difficult in a way . that 's one of the reasons why it 's valuable , is n't it , because it teaches a different set of skills ? because if you 're doing a traditional , say , history a-level or a science a-level , there 's a very strict syllabus and a course , there 's a textbook and people are taught to that particular syllabus ; with the welsh bac , it is individual students that have to think , for instance , of their own individual project . you ca n't get those off a shelf , and you ca n't necessarily just find that information easily . there 's real skill involved in being able to do that well and get graded well for that . so , i do not have concerns about the rigour . i do have concerns about some of the feedback by qualifications wales about the onerousness of the evaluation and what that means for teacher workload , which is one of the things that qualifications wales is looking at . but in terms of rigour and people being spoon-fed , then i do n't share those concerns . dawn bowden am : okay , because those were concerns , in the main , that were articulated by people delivering the welsh bac\u2014by teachers . so , i suppose the question then comes back to some of the other points that were being raised about the consistency , because that may well be from those teachers in schools where they 're not taking the bac as seriously as some others are . kirsty williams am : and , of course , there would be\u2014 . there is a professional responsibility for those teachers delivering that qualification to ensure that the ethos of that qualification and the skills\u2014 . it would potentially be a disservice to students if that qualification was being delivered in that way . dawn bowden am : and i think what i was trying to do was to highlight the different opinions , because we also heard from teachers who were saying that those involved with teaching and studying understood absolutely its rigour , so it was the mixed message , i guess , i was just trying to test out with you . similarly , on the skills challenge certificate , again we 've heard from various stakeholders about whether , in fact , this is considered to be an equivalent qualification . we 've heard people say that it is different\u2014it 's not the same as an a-level\u2014so , therefore you ca n't absolutely hold it up and say it 's the same as an a-level . it requires different skills , and so on and so forth . so , just your thoughts and views on that , really , as an equivalent qualification . kirsty williams am : it 's not a question of if this is an equivalent qualification ; this is an equivalent qualification . there is a rigorous process that is undertaken to evaluate these qualifications independent of the government , and it 's not a question . is it a different model and a different way of studying ? yes , of course it is , and that 's why we do it . that 's why i want children and young people to do both sets of qualifications , because it does engage and expand the acquisition of knowledge and skills . so , yes , it 's different . is it equivalent ? yes , it is , and that 's why , since the graded qualification came in , it is regarded by independent bodies as an equivalent to an a-level , and it has a tariff for ucas in the same way as a-levels would have tariffs . you only have to speak to the institutes of higher education who use this qualification as a way of setting grades\u2014you know , offers\u2014for students that they see that in the same way as well . lynne neagle am : suzy 's got a supplementary before we go on to talk in detail about universities . suzy davies am : is that okay ? because i just want to go back to this element of spoon-feeding at post 16 , where you said it 's actually very difficult for that to occur , because , obviously , we 're talking about the personal project , and so forth . we heard evidence in one of the schools sessions we did that baccalaureate students were being offered a very short and narrow list of subjects on which they could do their personal project , which actually limited the scope of what they were able to do . and we 've also heard separately\u2014it may have been with the colleges , i ca n't quite remember now\u2014that some students were being told , 'on your personal project , just put in what you did for your gcse-level baccalaureate , and add a few paragraphs . ' i 'm wondering how easy it is to disguise spoon-feeding at post 16 when we 've got two instances there that , to me , suggest it 's more about the convenience of the teachers , who perhaps may not be very enthusiastic about the bac , rather than making sure those children get the best out of the qualification . kirsty williams am : yes . and that would be really disappointing . and , again , if i can use my own personal family experience , my daughter has tried that on with her welsh bac teacher . she 's in a different school from where she did her earlier bac , and she said , 'oh , well , i 'll just rehash my `` votes at 16 '' that i did last year ' , and the welsh bac teacher has said , 'under no circumstances are you to do that\u2014no , that 's not allowed . ' this is about using your individual project , linked to something that maybe you hope to study at university , to get the value out of this qualification , and for you to be able to use this in your personal statement , and potentially in an interview . so , again , i guess what this does is show that there 's a variation , but certainly , where it is being delivered well , then that practice would not be encouraged , because it would be seen to be\u2014 suzy davies am : it 's gaming . kirsty williams am : \u2014denuding the students of the very valuable experience the qualification has to offer . suzy davies am : okay . thank you . cheers . lynne neagle am : okay . we 've got some questions now on how universities view it . hefin david . hefin david am : we 've had an online survey response , which was quite a stark comment , not from the vice-chancellor 's office , but from a member of staff within cardiff university . and it said : 'the welsh bacc is not a fair substitute for a full a-level , and should not be regarded as such . i consider it to be a disadvantage for welsh students , compared with their english counterparts . ' can you reflect on that ? kirsty williams am : i do n't agree . hefin david am : do you think that that 's a view that 's held within universities , and are you concerned about that ? because it is a view that 's obviously held within cardiff university . kirsty williams am : no ; i would say that that is a view held by an individual in cardiff university\u2014 hefin david am : who has influence over students . kirsty williams am : well , that is a view held by an individual in cardiff university . and , actually , cardiff university\u2014indeed , all welsh universities\u2014accept the welsh baccalaureate as an a-level equivalent . i think it is really important to reflect on the wide range of opportunities at higher education that the welsh bac affords individuals . that means that it is deemed as an equivalent to a-level for the vast majority of universities , to get in to some of the most competitive courses , such as dentistry , medicine , veterinary science . so , those courses where we know there 's a high demand and high competition for places , there are institutions that are using that , including cardiff to get into their medical degree . hefin david am : nick brazil , the deputy principal of gower college , said about 50 per cent of the russell group do n't value the welsh bac . kirsty williams am : well , i do n't know where he 's getting that from . i have made it a personal commitment to establish this with universities . i have visited both cambridge and oxford . i spoke again to cambridge , oxford , bath , southampton , st andrews , only last week , who were exhibiting at the seren conference . i specifically took the opportunity to meet with those universities and to talk to them about how they feel about the welsh bac . they have a high regard for the welsh baccalaureate in a variety of ways . first of all , for many of those universities , for many of their courses , they use the welsh bac as an equivalent to an a-level . if they do n't , there are some courses , for instance , where they will lower their offer to gain a place at that university if the welsh bac is passed at a certain level . so , for instance , rather than maybe offering a welsh student a , a , b , they would offer a welsh student a , b , b , plus a welsh bac , thus giving students two opportunities to gain a place at that university , either with or without their welsh bac qualification . even for those universities that do n't use the welsh baccalaureate as a formal part of their offer\u2014and this is the conversation i had again last week with oxford and cambridge\u2014they value it as part of a student 's personal statement ; they value it as part of the interview process in which a student may or may not then be offered a place at that university ; and they also recognise that the skills learnt by students whilst undertaking the welsh baccalaureate are exactly the skills that those students need to make a successful transition from a-level work to university-type work , which , if you can imagine , is very much based on individual research and being able to guide your own learning . so , i just do n't recognise that in some way welsh students are being disadvantaged . the message i get consistently from universities is that there are significant advantages to welsh learners taking this qualification . hefin david am : okay . you can not recognise it , but that is contrary to the evidence that we 've received . i 'm not saying that the evidence is conclusive , but it actually demonstrates inconsistency . so , would you go so far as to accept instead then that there is an inconsistency in the way that universities use the welsh bac as a tool for application ? kirsty williams am : you would know better than anybody , hefin , that universities are autonomous institutions and they set their own methods of entry into those institutions . what i 'm telling you is that the evidence that i have received from universities is that , whilst there is a variety of approaches to how they regard the qualification in terms of offers , consistently , absolutely across the board , all universities tell me that the welsh baccalaureate is a valuable qualification and does not disadvantage welsh students . hefin david am : if the committee were to produce a report based on the evidence we 've received , that would be contrary to what you 've just said . so , i think we 'd end up in a debate in which we are setting out different points of view . so , would you therefore commit to exploring that perspective ? kirsty williams am : hefin , i would argue that i have indeed explored that perspective because i have taken the trouble to find out first-hand\u2014not via my officials , but first-hand\u2014from those institutions , their views . so , this is not something that is hearsay ; i have undertaken to ascertain the views of those universities . we have written to all vice-chancellors\u2014last year\u2014with regard to the welsh baccalaureate qualification . qualifications wales has an individual whose specific job it is to ensure that universities across the united kingdom understand the value of welsh qualifications . that will become increasingly important as we see a divergence between english and welsh qualifications . but i have to say that the evidence that i have from universities is that the welsh baccalaureate , whilst it may be used in different ways in terms of an offer , the consistency from all universities is that it is a valuable qualification . if you 've heard differently from admissions tutors and from the universities officially , rather than from somebody who has e-mailed in , then i would be pleased to look at that evidence , because it would be in stark contrast to what i am being told by universities . lynne neagle am : hefin is not referring to an e-mail\u2014 hefin david am : no , i 've said that . lynne neagle am : \u2014we did do a survey and we 've also taken oral evidence . hefin david am : yes , and it 's representing the evidence that we received . kirsty williams am : and i 'm presenting you with the evidence that i 've received . hefin david am : but it will be presented to you as a submission from this committee , no doubt . let 's look at some admissions offers instead then . you do concede that there is inconsistency with how admissions offers are made with regard to the skills challenge certificate . how would you suggest that that is addressed ? kirsty williams am : hefin , each individual institution and university the length and breadth of the uk have different ways in which they make offers to individuals . what is absolutely clear to me , and if the concern is around the type of institution\u2014 . so , for instance , it is accepted as a third-grade offer in bristol , edinburgh , exeter , lancaster , leeds , leicester , liverpool , the london school of economics\u2014some of the highest performing universities and russell group universities . it is accepted as a fourth qualification or amends the offer in places like bath university , and it is accepted in tariff-point offers in places like hull and the university of the west of england . so there is a variety of ways in which universities use the qualification , and that is their prerogative\u2014that 's their prerogative as institutions . they will have different ways in which they recruit and how they offer places , just like different universities will have different views on unconditional offers . you know , there 's a difference in universities there , is n't there ? some universities do n't have unconditional offers at all ; other universities\u2014 hefin david am : so , what you 're saying is that the problem is n't connected to the welsh bac , it 's connected with just the way that universities make offers , and the welsh bac has got nothing to do with it . kirsty williams am : i \u2019 m saying there is a variety . just like any other qualification , there is a variety in how universities use qualifications for offers . what i \u2019 m saying to you is that , in the conversations that i have had with russell group universities , what they say is that there is certainly no detriment to any welsh student undertaking this qualification . they value the qualification . they think it is useful . it develops a set of skills that help students to make that transition into higher education . and therefore , i think it is a myth\u2014i would go as far as to say that it \u2019 s a myth\u2014that welsh students are disadvantaged in any way by taking this qualification . sorry , andrew . andrew clark : could i just add to that response ? there are , obviously , differences in the way that universities treat the skills challenge certificate and the welsh baccalaureate , which is the prime focus of this . the attitude of the universities has changed significantly since that was a graded qualification . kirsty williams am : yes , that has made a difference . andrew clark : and even those who do not make it part of their offer consider it exceedingly valuable in the way that young people are prepared to go to university and , therefore , as part of their personal statement , as part of their interview , the activity that the young person has taken by means of the skills challenge certificate is definitely recognised , even by those who don \u2019 t actually make it part of their offer . so , we \u2019 re still on a journey\u2014that graded qualification has only been taught for a couple of years , but the journey is taking us to the right place , towards the right destination . hefin david am : okay . so , it isn \u2019 t just about variable admissions practices across universities ; it is to deal with the skills challenge certificate as well , which needed changing in order to improve that . andrew clark : but that was changed in september 2015 . when it was a 'yes'/'no ' qualification , i think they held it in less regard than they do now that it is a graded qualification . kirsty williams am : and that \u2019 s the conversation we had with some of our russell group universities . andrew clark : and that was an important shift three years ago . hefin david am : okay . so , last question , then : are you absolutely confident that any concerns we are offering are nothing really to worry about ? kirsty williams am : we will need to continue to communicate to all audiences the importance of this and the value of this qualification . but i am confident that the university sector , in its wide variety of forms , regards the welsh baccalaureate qualification as a valuable endeavour for welsh students to undertake , and they certainly don \u2019 t regard it as a detriment to students . lynne neagle am : okay . si\u00e2n wants to come in on this , and then i 've got a question from suzy on seren . sian gwenllian am : yes , just that the committee , of course , has been trying to gain evidence on this sector from the universities themselves , but universities wales , which represents the interests of universities in wales , has rejected the committee 's invitation to submit any oral or written evidence . so , can you see the dilemma we 're in ? we are hearing a few things coming from some universities , we hear what you 're saying , but we ca n't get to the root of the matter because the universities themselves are n't willing to come to speak to us . are you also disappointed that they have rejected our invitation to come and speak to us ? hefin david am : where 's the enthusiasm , chair ? where 's the enthusiasm ? sian gwenllian am : and perhaps that 's a sign that they do n't want to be drawn into this argument between the government and us as a committee . kirsty williams am : well , it \u2019 s a matter for individual universities to decide whether they want to participate in the work of this committee . i would urge them to do so . all welsh universities regard the welsh baccalaureate as an equivalent to a-level , and all universities use it as part of their offer\u2014welsh universities . sian gwenllian am : yes , but you see what our dilemma is , though , because if we can \u2019 t actually ask them directly , it 's a bit difficult for us to actually probe this and to help move things on ? anyway , i 'll leave it at that . thank you . kirsty williams am : well , it 's a matter for them , and maybe the chair would like to take that up with universities wales . lynne neagle am : we have had quite an extensive dialogue with them about it . suzy on seren . suzy davies am : so , just briefly , you \u2019 ve said several times that having a welsh bac qualification is an advantage and certainly no detriment , and that it \u2019 s valued by universities . but advantage isn't the same as equivalence , and we have had evidence from\u2014i think it was cardiff university , again , where they had students with two a-levels and a bac who were actually performing as weaker students . so , even though on the face of it you 've got three a-levels , those particular students are n't matching up to the expectations of a student with three a-levels . i do want to challenge what you said about the students who are involved in the seren network about the baccalaureate being accepted for things like veterinary medicine and medicine itself . we 've had evidence from fe colleges , which are now significant players in producing our seren-style students , if you like , that they are exempting their students from doing the bac because it 's a distraction , effectively . what 's your comment on that ? because if this is a question of communication , which i suspect you 're about to tell me , one of the axioms of good communication is you can have the best marketing in the world , but if the product you 're selling is n't highly valued then you 're actually just doubling the problem . so , can you explain to me why fe is exempting their highest flyers from doing the bac ? kirsty williams am : i think sometimes colleges make the decision that four or five a-levels is of an advantage , and therefore , if you 're asking students to carry that workload , which is a considerable workload , that 's the preferred route for more able and talented students . again , what is quite clear in all the conversations that i have had with russell group universities , including oxford and cambridge , is that this is a myth . what universities tell me they want is not necessarily students with four or five a-levels ; they want students with three really exceptional grades at a-level and a welsh baccalaureate . i think that 's really , really an important message to get across\u2014that it is not necessary to do four or five a-levels if you aspire to go to these russell group universities , or if you decide you want to apply to oxford and cambridge . as i said , in the conversations that we have had\u2014and there is actually some research , and i will let the committee have links to the research . there is some research to suggest that those students who have been involved in project-based work\u2014and , of course , that 's not just the welsh baccalaureate , that would be the epq , which is a qualification that is rapidly gaining traction in england . that is an extended project\u2014research based\u2014qualification , very similar to the individual project element of the welsh baccalaureate . the epq in england is seen as a qualification taken by more able and talented students , and what we see in some of the research that is coming forward is that those students who have engaged in that type of work , project-based work , individual-led , research-based work\u2014those skills are the skills that are really attuned to the nature of university-type work . therefore , that is valued by universities and there is some indication to say that there is a correlation between the students who have undertaken that work and their potential success at undergraduate level . they also tell me that there is a link between , for instance , being able then to use those skills to gain work experience , placements and internships in the private sector and in the world of work , because , as i said , those types of skills are really , really valuable and therefore that 's why they value the qualification . suzy davies am : can i just add\u2014 ? it 's great that they 're telling you , why are n't they telling fe ? kirsty williams am : well , as i said , i think it 's really important that fe colleges understand that there is a myth around the fact that these universities are looking for four or five a-levels , and if that 's the reason why then colleges are not allowing students or dissuading students from taking the welsh bac , i think we need to reflect on what 's important to those universities\u2014which is the right a-levels . i think it 's really , really important that students are given the best advice about the a-levels they need to take , facilitating subjects to get into a university , and the value of the skills and knowledge they will acquire through the welsh bac as an assistance to them going forward . suzy davies am : okay , thanks . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : actually , it 's your set of questions next on universal adoption . suzy davies am : i 'll try and keep this on the shorter side , if that 's okay , everybody . you say in your evidence that you expect universal adoption , basically , by 2020 , i think it is , or it might be 2019 . what do you think universal adoption actually means ? what does it look like ? does it mean 100 per cent adoption ? kirsty williams am : what is means is that i expect all institutions to be in a position to deliver the welsh baccalaureate . i believe it should be an entitlement to all welsh students to be able to study this qualification , and i believe we should work to the situation where it becomes the norm to take the welsh baccalaureate . i also recognise that in some individual cases , there may be very good reasons why perhaps this is not aligned to the well-being of that particular student . but when i talk about universal adoption , i expect all our institutions to be in a position to deliver the qualification , and i believe it should be an entitlement for welsh students to be able to undertake this qualification . suzy davies am : but not an obligation\u2014that 's the bit i 'm trying to get at . kirsty williams am : i think it should become the norm , and if there are exceptions to that , and there could well be for very legitimate reasons , i think that that flexibility should be allowed . but i think , for those students who are not doing that welsh baccalaureate , there should be evidence as to why that decision has been taken . suzy davies am : okay , so there 's a presumption . i think the performance measures , probably , are likely to sharpen the minds of some school leaders , so i won't pursue that . but can you tell me what lesson you may have learnt from the universal obligation for students to study welsh language in schools when those schools were n't particularly ready to offer a quality course ? kirsty williams am : as we 've rehearsed earlier , it is important that all of our schools and colleges are in a position to deliver this qualification well and deliver a really positive experience to learners . that 's why there is existing support available , and via our new professional learning programmes there will be more support available for teachers to ensure that they have the skills and the confidence to deliver the qualification in a high-quality manner . suzy davies am : okay . well , that 's going to take some time . would you consider pausing the presumption of universal roll-out until you 're absolutely sure that all institutions are able to offer the bac to the quality that you would like to see it delivered ? kirsty williams am : not at this stage . i have no intention of pausing . we have evidence that schools are already delivering the qualification really well\u2014 suzy davies am : but you know that we 've had evidence , and you must have as well , that not all schools are doing it . kirsty williams am : what we do know is that some schools struggle to deliver existing qualifications . i do n't know why we would turn round and say that this qualification needs to be stopped when we wouldn't stop other qualifications , and we 'd say , 'well , there we are , we have n't got a 100 per cent guarantee that every single school is delivering this particular qualification especially well , therefore we 're going to denude the opportunity of students to study that particular subject . ' what we 're saying is , 'there is a responsibility on us , on individual schools and on our regional consortia to endure that there is professional learning in place so that all schools are in a position to deliver the qualification well . ' suzy davies am : is n't it irresponsible to ask students to be obliged to take a qualification that 's badly delivered ? kirsty williams am : what is irresponsible is not to invest in professional learning to ensure that all schools are in a position to deliver it well . suzy davies am : okay . well , i agree with you on that , actually , which is why i was a bit confused when you had some in-year additional money in this year 's budget that was being given out to consortia rather than to schools to improve the ability of their teachers to deliver the welsh baccalaureate in certain schools . can you tell me whether the money\u2014i think it was about \u00a35 million that was going to the consortia in-year\u2014will you will offer them suggestions that that is used for improving baccalaureate teaching ? kirsty williams am : the money that is available is going via consortia to schools . individual schools are best placed to understand the professional learning needs of their staff . and if that school understands that they have particular professional learning needs for the welsh baccalaureate , then i would expect the money to be spent on that . where a school is doing the welsh baccalaureate particularly well , then the school might identify other areas where they look to seek improvement . therefore , it is for the individual school to assess the professional learning needs of their staff . we ca n't second-guess that , and therefore it has to be right that school leaders are able to plan the professional learning of their staff accordingly . suzy davies am : i completely accept that and , as i say , it's not for all schools , but bearing in mind we 're facing evidence of polarisation of delivery , i'm just wondering whether there was n't a letter suggesting that they may want to focus on this in the schools that are n't delivering this well at the moment . kirsty williams am : well , again , that 's a conversation to be had between challenge advisors in our regional consortia who are aware of the strengths and weaknesses in individual schools , in conjunction with the leadership of those schools , to discuss how that professional learning money is best spent . there is n't a school that is fantastic at everything , nor is there a school that is not good at anything , if you know what i mean . there are strengths and weaknesses in all schools . it is for the regional consortia , via challenge advisers , and the headteacher , to have that conversation about what the professional learning needs are for that particular school , to ensure that all their teachers , across the length and breadth of the curriculum , are in a position to deliver good-quality lessons . but we ca n't second-guess that . kevin palmer : can i just make a further comment ? i 'll be this afternoon meeting with the regional consortia , estyn , the universities , and the rest of what we call 'the middle tier ' to discuss with them the configuration of a national curriculum for professional learning , premised on the priorities that are emerging from our current work with pioneer schools . and the shifts in pedagogy that you all know is found behind some of these issues , with the delivery of the welsh bac , those shifts in pedagogy are right at the core of the national approach to professional learning\u2014so , things like project-based learning , the kinds of things you talked about today , moving away from a spoon-feeding model , not just for the welsh bac but actually right across the curriculum . the new curriculum requires us to move in these new directions . so , it 's absolutely true to say that each individual school is different , each individual practitioner is different , but we must give the regions and the heis , as it were , a menu of things , and guidance around where there are clearly weaknesses in schools . those weaknesses need to be addressed . suzy davies am : i accept that we 're going forward towards donaldson , and i 'm sure that you will be getting questions on that at some time in the future . i 'm more concerned about this bac that 's been around for 10 years , and there 's still , as far as we can tell from the evidence that we 've had , poor delivery in some schools , where there 's the prospect of obligation on the horizon . that was the thing that was worrying me . anyway , thank you . lynne neagle am : i think the issue of the difference between entitlement and obligation is a very important one and is a concern to students . you were saying it 's an entitlement , not an obligation , but we have had very clear evidence from colleges that some of them are making young people do it , and schools are making young people do it . so , what do you say to those schools that are insisting on their pupils doing the welsh bac at post 16 ? kirsty williams am : as i said , i hope that it becomes the norm that at post-16 level students take the welsh baccalaureate , because i think it is of huge value . there may be circumstances that mean that the well-being of that student could be compromised by making them do this qualification . there could be a whole host of reasons why it is not suitable for a child to take this qualification , and therefore there has to be some flexibility in the system , and we have to trust in the professional leadership of our colleges and our headteachers to make that decision in the round , with the pupil and their parents , about what 's in the best interests of those pupils . but i do think a situation where , perhaps , an entire cohort of students are suddenly deemed it 's unsuitable for , i find that very hard to believe , but there could well be circumstances , for a whole host of reasons , where that particular qualification\u2014 . and we would not want to jeopardise the well-being of a student by forcing them to do a qualification that was n't in their best interests , and we need to have the flexibility in the system to allow school leaders to make that decision , but they should also then be accountable for that decision . lynne neagle am : but do you recognise there 's maybe a case for strengthening guidance , then , on this ? because , we 've had teachers tell us that they have insisted on pupils doing this , and then the parents have rung welsh government , and they felt undermined , then . so , do you think there 's a case for strengthening the guidance or clarifying what the position is to schools and colleges ? kirsty williams am : very happy to do that . as i said , from time to time , parents do indeed contact welsh government , and in that contact there is a whole variety of reasons why that parent feels the welsh baccalaureate is not in the best interests of those children . sometimes , that can go from the extreme of , ' i want my child to do five a-levels and i think that 's in their best interest to get into oxford and cambridge'\u2014i would argue that that is a myth , around the need to do that many a-levels\u2014through to , 'actually , my child has a range of learning needs , and actually this qualification is n't suited to them . making them go out and do voluntary work in an organisation with people that do n't understand their needs and they are unfamiliar with could jeopardise my child 's ability and my child 's well-being . ' so , there 's a whole range of reasons why sometimes people have concerns about the welsh baccalaureate . some of those are very legitimate concerns . sometimes , they 're based on information that , perhaps , is n't correct , or the myths around , ' i need to do five a-levels if i want to go to cambridge ' . schools , then , have some flexibility . i 'm aware of a case last year where a parent felt very concerned that the students were also having to study for entrance exams into cambridge . a conversation was had with the school . they were able to allow the student extra time to study for that qualification and pick up their welsh bac work later on in the academic year . so , they were able to be flexible in the delivery of that qualification . i 'm very pleased to say that we 've had correspondence from said parent to say that his son went on to do exceptionally well in his a-levels and his welsh baccalaureate and gained his place at cambridge university , and that 's about having the flexibility , even at a school level , to be able to respond to the needs of individual students . lynne neagle am : okay . just one final question from me on this , then . as you know , mental health and the emotional health of our children and young people is a very core issue for this committee , and estyn have said that studying the skills challenge certificate alongside three or four a-levels is a significant factor in causing stress for some young people . how do you respond to that ? kirsty williams am : well , i would be the first to acknowledge that studying a-levels can be a very stressful time . that 's because students , rightly , regard those qualifications as high stakes and as having a profound effect on the opportunities for the rest of their lives . so , the mere fact of studying a-levels can be a really stressful time for students because they understand how important they are , and students want to do well and they want to be able to move on to the next stage , either of work or of university . we also know\u2014and estyn reflects this\u2014that students are also often trying to combine that with part-time jobs . these students are of an age when they want to be out and about and earning some of their own money and being a bit more independent . so , that adds added pressure to them . so , undoubtedly , this is a stressful time in young people 's lives and we need to ensure that there is support in school to support young people through this time to make sure that students are making the right choices in terms of their a-levels and the qualifications that they 're doing so they 're not having to do more because they 're under the impression that , by doing more , that 's going to make them more likely to succeed . what we know , actually , is it 's about the quality of what you do rather than the entirety of what you do that 's important to universities , and we need to make sure that students are getting really good information , advice and guidance and support at what is a challenging time in their lives , because , of course , it comes on top of working really hard for your gcses and then you have , the following year , as-level examinations and a-level examinations after that . so , these are stressful times in children 's lives and they realise the importance of these as high-stakes qualifications . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . the next questions are from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : this is about the wider impact of studying the welsh bac on other curriculum subjects and education provision , and we 've had representations in that it is causing some concerns . so , do you have any concerns about the effect that the welsh bac may be having on wider education provisions , such as the narrowing of the curriculum at key stage 4 ? kirsty williams am : no . obviously , schools are responsible for planning their local curriculum offer , and that needs to meet the needs of their learners , and it also needs to meet the needs of the learning and skills ( wales ) measure 2009 . so , there should be a wide variety of choices available . i believe that the skills challenge certificate actually does ensure that there is a broad curriculum and that children are exposed to different learning opportunities . and so , rather than narrowing it , i believe the welsh bac helps us to make sure that there is an expansive curriculum , and that lots of different issues are explored in the skills challenge certificate that ensure not just academic skills are developed , but , actually , knowledge and skills of a wider range of subjects about you and your place in the world is available via this qualification . janet finch-saunders am : okay , thanks . and then , to what extent do you think that the welsh bac should be give priority over other curriculum subjects ? kirsty williams am : well , i do n't think it's\u2014 . it should n't be at the expense of other subjects . it should be part of that wide range of opportunities that are afforded to students , and i do n't think it 's more important or less important than other aspects of what we already ask schools to deliver . janet finch-saunders am : what about where we 've taken representations that there 's a lack of capacity in terms of all the extra pressures of studying the welsh bac along with other qualifications ? i went to a school in bangor , and , again , as has been said here , it 's very polarised , the evidence that we 're taking\u2014either some have found it very easy or some , including teachers , have found it extremely difficult to fit everything in , and they do believe that there is a lack of capacity there . kirsty williams am : and the onerous nature and the consequences of workload for teachers is acknowledged by the qualifications wales work and review into the qualification , and that is one of the things that we 're looking to address so that the assessment arrangements and workload implications for teachers are not too onerous . and , if there is any element of duplication\u2014students being asked to do things over and over\u2014then that needs to be addressed as well , and that 's why there is this review by the design group . janet finch-saunders am : okay , thanks . and then , how do you respond to concerns that learners are avoiding studying the welsh bac\u2014 where they can , that is\u2014by attending institutions in england or institutions that do not offer welsh-medium provision ? kirsty williams am : well , it 's interesting , is n't it , about where children choose to study and whether they are motivated by the avoidance of the welsh bac ? people make decisions about where to study for a whole host of reasons , and it 's difficult sometimes to quantify what those are . so , for instance , we often hear this along the border that , because\u2014 . the geography is not easy , but it can be relatively easy to go across into the english system and therefore you do n't have to do this . now , the reasons for that could be very variable . it could be about the nature of the offer . we know that , in some of our rural schools , the secondary sixth forms are n't able to offer a wide variety of a-levels , and perhaps , by going to a different institution , a larger institution across the way , then you can get that combination of the a-levels you want to do , which simply is n't possible if you do it in your home school . or , we do have some consortia arrangements where a-levels are delivered across a wide variety of schools , which require students to travel . some students do n't want to do that ; they do n't want to do their a-levels in three different schools , but they 'd rather go to an institution where they can do it all under one roof . and that means , sometimes , moving across the border or , in the area i live , children making the decision to go to merthyr college , because its a lovely , beautiful new building , the facilities are absolutely fantastic and a wide variety of a-levels is available under one roof . we looked at , in particular , also , the perception of quality . so , if we take the example of king henry viii school in abergavenny , a school where , in the past , there have been , i think , within the community , some concerns about the quality of that school\u2014whether it 's regarded as a good school . and , from that particular location , you can quite easily get to hereford college\u2014a college that has a fantastic offer , does very , very well and has a beautiful building . what we do , if we look at the tracking of the students who have been retained in king henry viii , as that school has been on its improvement journey and has done better and better and better , the number of students that they are retaining into their sixth form has grown . so , the perception is , 'this is a good school , i 'm going to get a good-quality experience here ' , and more and more students are choosing to stay in that school than perhaps make the decision to travel somewhere else . we also have to recognise that , for some students , staying in the sixth form is n't what they want to do ; they want a different experience , they want to go to an fe college . they want a different experience . so , we have to take into consideration that students could be motivated by a wide variety of subjects , and there 's no hard-and-fast evidence that it is avoidance of the bac that is the sole driver for some of these choices . lynne neagle am : si\u00e2n , on this . sian gwenllian am : the evidence that we 've had from one of the teaching unions\u2014robust and clear evidence\u2014is that this is happening , that is , that young people are leaving wales to go over the border to schools in england in order to avoid the welsh bac . that 's exactly what was said to us . but you do n't accept that evidence . kirsty williams am : i 'm not saying that i do n't accept it . i 'm saying that i think there are a wide variety of reasons why students make decisions about where to study . i 'm not aware of any comprehensive piece of work that has looked at those motivations , and i think there could be a whole host of reasons why children are deciding to move across the border . perhaps the welsh bac is an easy one to place that hook on , and that 's easier to acknowledge , is n't it , than saying that perhaps students are making that choice for other reasons . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . the next questions , then , are on teacher learning from suzy . suzy davies am : actually , i 've asked the question that i wanted to ask . lynne neagle am : okay , you do n't want to\u2014 suzy davies am : by all means you ask the others i had . lynne neagle am : okay . you have referred to training already . the committee 's got two concerns , really . one is about preparedness in ite to teach the welsh bac , so i do n't know if you want to expand on how teachers are being skilled up at that level to deliver the welsh bac effectively . kirsty williams am : in the accreditation process , which has not been without its pain , and some significant decisions made in that regard , the criteria for the ite programmes note that , and i 'm going to quote it : 'teachers should be able to help children and young people to make links across their learning , bringing together different aspects to examine , for example , important topics such as citizenship , enterprise , financial capability and sustainability . ' so , the prime driver for our ite reforms , obviously , is the preparedness for 'successful futures ' , but in preparing our teachers to be in a position to successfully deliver that , those are also the pedagogical principles and that shift in pedagogy that we see aligned to the welsh baccalaureate . so , it is actually a part of the accreditation process that the curriculum that the new ite providers will have to deliver\u2014ensuring that teachers have those skills and have that confidence to be able to deliver their teaching in a way that , as i said , ensures that we successfully deliver on donaldson , but also on the same pedagogical principles that are needed for the successful delivery of the welsh bac . suzy davies am : in the pre-donaldson period , then , bearing in mind what you 've just said , do you expect to see a surge in improvement on how the baccalaureate is taken up by those schools that are currently less keen on it ? kirsty williams am : i hope that we will see increased numbers of students taking the qualification and an increase in the quality of that experience for young people . as we discussed earlier , we 're not just waiting for the new graduates to come out of our ite providers . there 's a whole cohort of the workforce already out there . they should be given an equal opportunity to ensure that they have the skills to deliver on our curriculum reforms and our reform qualifications , and every time the previous government has brought in a reformed qualification there have been specific resources made available to ensure that teachers are in a position to do that . so , when we changed to maths numeracy , a new qualification that was to be examined , there was specific resource made available for the professional learning for teachers to make sure that they were in a position to do that , and that 's exactly the same as the offer that we have available for teachers who are delivering the welsh bac . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . and you 've already said about continuing professional development , that this is going to be a core part of the cpd . is there anything that you want to add on that ? is it going to be fully integrated into the professional learning offer ? kirsty williams am : yes , absolutely . there is already\u2014i do n't want to make the impression that there 's not already support available out there . there is already support out there via regional consortia for professional learning with regard to the welsh baccalaureate . there is existing support available from the wjec with regard to welsh baccalaureate , and it will continue , as we drive forward our national approach to professional learning . and , increasingly , there are interesting ways in which we 're supporting students , so i do n't know if members are aware of the new mooc . the university of bath , one of the russell group universities , delivered a mooc for the extended project qualification in england . lynne neagle am : what 's a mooc ? [ laughter . ] kirsty williams am : so , it is an online\u2014a massive open online course . so , it 's a course that is delivered free of charge , and it 's delivered by information technology . so , the university of bath have done this mooc to support students with the epq . they have just launched , in conjunction with aberystwyth university , a bilingual mooc for the individual project for welsh bac . it 's our understanding it is the first ever welsh-medium mooc , we think ; we 're not aware of any others . and this resource is there for students to give them advice on how they do choose the thesis for their individual project : how do you go about , then , undertaking good independent research ; how do you reference properly , to ensure that you do that correctly ? and we 've seen over 1,000 students already sign up for the mooc . so , increasingly , there are lots and lots of new resources out there for both teachers and students to make the most of . and the fact that bath and aberystwyth have worked together on this , i believe , shows their commitment and a demonstration of their support for this qualification , otherwise why would the university of bath bother , if they were n't interested in it ? lynne neagle am : okay . just one final question from me . i 've written to you about a young constituent who moved institutions and resat the welsh bac , but was n't able , because of the wjec policy , to obtain a higher grade in it , because they 've got a policy that the grade is capped when you resit it . given what the committee 's been told about the variability in the way this is taught in institutions in wales , do you think it 's fair that young people should n't be able to go and resit it somewhere else and get a better grade ? kirsty williams am : well , given that welsh ministers are independent of the qualification system , i would want to be careful about what i said , because it is for the wjec and qualifications wales to regulate this . but , clearly , we would want to reflect on making sure that students have an opportunity , and a fair opportunity . andrew , i do n't know if you 've got any observations that you 'd like to make . andrew clark : no , not really . i think it 's an individual case , this one\u2014 lynne neagle am : but it could apply to lots of young people , could n't it ? i mean , that 's the point here . i know it 's a constituent 's case and i do n't normally raise those in the chair , but i think , given what we 've learned about variability , it is a valid issue for young people in wales , really . andrew clark : yes , whether it 's particularly related to the welsh baccalaureate , though , i 'm not so certain . and i think that would be a better question to ask the wjec , perhaps , and qualifications wales , because it 's a deliberate act that that activity is at arm 's length from welsh ministers . lynne neagle am : okay . any other questions from members ? no . okay , well , can i thank the cabinet secretary and her officials for attending ? we 've had a very useful discussion this morning , which will inform our report on this . as usual , you 'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy , but thank you again for your attendance . kirsty williams am : thank you . lynne neagle am : item 3 , then , is papers to note . paper to note 1 is a letter from the llywydd to the first minister on the role of the assembly in the process of legislating for brexit . paper to note 2 is a letter from the cabinet secretary for education and the minister for welsh language and lifelong learning with additional information following the meeting on 8 november . are members happy to note those ? suzy davies am : can i just make a comment on the first of those letters , the one from the llywydd ? i recommend to assembly members that they read that again if they can , because , actually , it 's an important issue that is easily lost in the other things that we talk about with brexit , and that is the role of this assembly in scrutinising secondary legislation falling out of brexit . hefin david am : can i ask a question ? was that a reflection of all the chairs ? lynne neagle am : yes . it came to the panel of chairs\u2014 hefin david am : and it was obviously unanimous\u2014 lynne neagle am : \u2014and we agreed that we wanted that letter sent . suzy davies am : thank you for that ."
