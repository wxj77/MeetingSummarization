    "answer": "user interface : well i was just wondering about if we 're gon na do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . project manager : okay uh , let 's take like this . let 's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay . industrial designer : project manager : so no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design . okay ? so we will introduce m this model and uh let 's introduce in the market and let 's take the feedback from the customers , then we can uh go for the industrial designer : second generation . project manager : second generation . user interface : project manager : okay . there 's no end , there 's not limit . industrial designer : user interface : the problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we have n't thought of . project manager : every every custom industrial designer : marketing : well , then it may not be . project manager : okay . well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there 's no end , there 's no limit . marketing : like people do n't like wood . user interface : no , but there 's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we do n't really have anything to back it up . marketing : very specific . project manager : yeah , so that 's the reason you are here for uh the design , okay , i hope you made a good design . user interface : yes , but i 'm not everybody . industrial designer : user interface : i mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . we have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that does n't mean that that 's what 's gon na sell . project manager : yeah , but uh see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like uh you can eat uh you can all eat more chi i can eat more chilli , okay , so i it 's a depends on the individual taste , you know , industrial designer : project manager : so we have we have to balance somewhere . user interface : yeah , of course . i 'm just trying to point out that i think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and industrial designer : our project does n't um project manager : yeah . user interface : a lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy . industrial designer : disposable diapers is an example of that in fact . user interface : really ? industrial designer : yes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product , user interface : that i did n't know . industrial designer : and uh people the market had n't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it was n't uh user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , project manager : . industrial designer : but people had gotten the throw-away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they had n't um so , you 're right , timing is very important , user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but i think we 've got a good product . project manager : that 's the reason ed is here . user interface : yeah . project manager : i think he can promote the the brand value and the product value . industrial designer : that 's right . it 's gon na be very important to the company . project manager : yes . we are behind the scene and he is the front screen , so . he 's on the big screen . marketing : yeah , i 'm the one who takes the heat . user interface : exactly . industrial designer : good luck , ed . marketing : if it 's a flop , it 's the marketer . industrial designer : you look very relaxed , considering h you know , the uh the weight on your shoulders , yeah . marketing : yes . yes . stress ."
