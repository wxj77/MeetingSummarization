    "answer": "project manager : um therefore , younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that 's w we should make our our our r_c_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . user interface : yeah it 's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you do n't see two separate keys there actually industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh project manager : ma maybe maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh marketing : mm . but i think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we 're going after a younger market , user interface : yeah so . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : hmm . yes yes marketing : that 's the the the mm the new and the funky things , industrial designer : because they are already used to that , you know , product . marketing : that 's , project manager : yes it 's recognisable industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , there 's lot there 's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . project manager : mm mm . marketing : that 's project manager : and and they are skilled uh by using it . user interface : so for example uh well uh industrial designer : mm-hmm . .. . user interface : okay , it works . fine . so , for example you have uh presently uh keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that project manager : mael can you hand me over this uh ? industrial designer : yes . project manager : uh thank you . marketing : mm-hmm . okay . how much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? project manager : mm well marketing : 'cause we have n't talked about demographic at all project manager : i think fi five min user interface : forty minutes ? marketing : and it 's a very important issue . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so . too sorry , so we basically do n't change the uh original order of them industrial designer : user interface : but then the keys are more spacious , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : they do n't look uh so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , uh four , sorry four here uh five and six , marketing : mm . mm . user interface : so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : for you do n't have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to project manager : okay . 'kay i i think now that the idea 's clear . uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . which i think is quite tricky . industrial designer : marketing : um , basically we 're trying to get people to buy a remote control user interface : yeah . marketing : would n't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? user interface : project manager : of course they have already one . so our our our remote control has to be better . marketing : but it 's not going to have more functionality , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : 'cause it 's only a low market , it 's a cheap-end remote control , we ca n't beat modern functionality , we might we 'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that 's not a big seller , if they 're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so i 'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing . project manager : mm . i well i think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh r_c_ is is important when they are buying one marketing : mm . yeah . but why are they buying one in the first place ?"
