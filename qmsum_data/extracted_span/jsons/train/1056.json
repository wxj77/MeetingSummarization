    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about the new requirement and basic functions .",
    "answer": "project manager : first um , they say that 's uh about something about t teletext . uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date . out-dated . and uh because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it 's not useful to have teletext . um . so i think we can avoid the teletext . um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for tv , not for d_v_d_ and other devices , because it make it it makes it 's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on tv on the only specific tv remote control . industrial designer : i agree . project manager : the third the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . so um uh we should we should keep uh the the product should be recognisable . uh , uh it 's that mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of in electronics . so , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it 's from real reaction and he s they should recognise the company . so , um so now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . so , mm , are we going to use lcd , speech recognition ? uh . marketing : well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . project manager : yeah . marketing : and then we can move on to the more advanced features . user interface : mm . yes . project manager : maybe , maybe . industrial designer : okay , so the available things are lcd , the buttons and everything . uh radio frequency depends . and , well the recognition it depends on you guys . project manager : yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? industrial designer : you should probably speak . project manager : i mean industrial designer : okay . project manager : what do marketing : okay , well , i mean the obvious one is changing channels . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : i think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . marketing : yeah . project manager : so , yeah . marketing : yeah , okay . project manager : so , turning channel , of course . volume setting . industrial designer : uh just one note to the chan channel changing . do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? i mean those nine plus one or two ? project manager : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : i think it would be a b industrial designer : because it 's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . project manager : yeah . user interface : mm . project manager : on the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it 's marketing : yeah , i user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay so so we keep all these all these buttons . project manager : maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like user interface : yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . project manager : uh industrial designer : like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . project manager : yeah . maybe something like that . industrial designer : or using the names and the keyboard marketing : ah yeah . project manager : uh . industrial designer : i dunno . user interface : or project manager : maybe user interface : or something . project manager : oh i do n't know . oh . maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and industrial designer : you mean like hierarchical structure . project manager : and inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch . user interface : mm-hmm . okay . like categorising channels . project manager : if you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you 've you plus plus plus . industrial designer : okay , so s user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : oh sorry . project manager : i it just an idea . user interface : okay . project manager : i do n't know what you think about that but . industrial designer : so it requires the use of lcd probably , to to tell you project manager : yeah , probably , yeah , yeah . marketing : to have some feedback . yeah . industrial designer : okay , user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so i 'll make a note on lcd . marketing : we could maybe also c um incorporate petre 's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel . user interface : okay . project manager : okay . marketing : so we c you could quickly just through many channels . industrial designer : yeah . like roller for the yeah . okay . marketing : for the channels , perhaps . project manager : anything else ? marketing : so we 've got channel and volume . um . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ? marketing : i think so . project manager : yeah . marketing : i think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones . project manager : what about the settings of the tv ? because it 's button we do n't use very often , but it 's we need it anyway . so user interface : so uh we do n't have any uh we do n't have uh marketing : yeah . user interface : we should just design the remote control and we sh we do n't have any access to the to the tv design or we can change some design . because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can industrial designer : on the screen , you mean ? user interface : yeah . yeah b industrial designer : not on the control , but on the screen . user interface : not on the control , on the screen , on the tv screen . industrial designer : well , this would avoid lcd , then . user interface : and then marketing : i do n't oh , i do n't but i do n't think we 're we 're the ones . i mean this remote control we 're developing is a generic control for all tvs , i think . project manager : yeah , yeah . i do n't know if it 's possible to to watch something on tv user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : oh . w i i think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the tv to to to print these things . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the lcd and this stuff is no problem in the price . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . project manager : so , what are we doing with the settings ? because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . maybe with the lcd we can do something with less buttons , but user interface : yeah . marketing : but then you do n't want to make the lcd display too complicated at the same time . project manager : mm . industrial designer : two tvs . marketing : i mean there 's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some project manager : yeah . oh yeah . industrial designer : like ma project manager : oh , the . industrial designer : we we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode . user interface : project manager : industrial designer : or i dunno . user interface : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : or like children and grandfather 's mode , marketing : yeah . project manager : industrial designer : and the , well the the user project manager : industrial designer : not the user , the man mana tv manager mode . ah , i dunno . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . so we have five minutes left . um . project manager : yeah . marketing : so i think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they 're required . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : it 's just how to a project manager : we should hide them somewhere . industrial designer : hide them , okay . project manager : in the menus of the lcd or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . marketing : yeah . okay . yeah . uh , okay , what else ? industrial designer : um . yes . marketing : i mean a power button 's obviously industrial designer : this i was thinking . do we need a power button at all ? marketing : uh required . industrial designer : should should should n't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? because generally project manager : it 's it 's a kind of setting , i think . it should fit in those settings functions . user interface : mm . settings . project manager : because it 's not a very current useful function . marketing : uh , well i think when they say power button they mean to turn the tv on and off . project manager : no , i think it 's after after five minutes or something a timer industrial designer : yes . well i i uh project manager : i i think , no ? industrial designer : marketing : but if you 're watching tv for two hours , you do n't want your tv to turn off after five five minute industrial designer : project manager : industrial designer : you do n't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : uh probably . okay , so we should keep this button . user interface : yeah . marketing : i mean based on our usability studies again , um pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . project manager : oh okay , yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : um , you know , it was nine out of ten industrial designer : okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the lcd and all the buttons and stuff , marketing : re relevance . industrial designer : we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the tv and if you close it , it will project manager : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : turn off the tv . if if you like this , marketing : okay . b okay . industrial designer : because , well it 's maybe question for you t marketing : i think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . marketing : which is you sit down , you turn on your tv , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the tv off . project manager : yeah . so s yeah . marketing : um and all the other f functionality is industrial designer : user interface : yeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . marketing : not used very often . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : like covering cu . project manager : on the back , or industrial designer : yeah . i mean like the user interface : yeah , like mobile phone covering . industrial designer : yeah but since we have the lcd , we did n't need too much button too many buttons . um , okay , just um the decision of the power button . user interface : industrial designer : should we make it a button , or some some something which would be project manager : for what ? industrial designer : uh power button . marketing : i think a button . user interface : a button is better . project manager : ah oh yeah , yeah . marketing : i think it should be a bu industrial designer : if it if it 's a button or user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah a button , yeah i guess so . industrial designer : okay . marketing : its own button on the front . industrial designer : okay , one nice big button . marketing : industrial designer : old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers . project manager : user interface : project manager : user interface : marketing : okay . project manager : so , any other suggestions or functions ? marketing : s what about things like the clock and um timers ? industrial designer : do we still have the time ? i i just wonder . project manager : yeah , we have still one or two minutes to talk , yeah . industrial designer : okay . oh . well what w what was the question ? user interface : clock or marketing : uh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display project manager : usually it 's already on tv or something like that . industrial designer : yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : no ? because if if the tv turns on itself , it well you know , if the time the timer should be there . project manager : yeah . yeah . if we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ? i mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? this is the question . marketing : probably not . project manager : is it useful ? marketing : it 's a questi yeah , it 's a trade-off . project manager : w in my opinion we should have only useful thing and because apparently they want the simpler it 's is better . marketing : 'kay . industrial designer : ah , yeah . marketing : okay simple . industrial designer : did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the tv , user interface : project manager : industrial designer : well and based on your user interface : marketing : very , yeah okay , very occasionally . industrial designer : marketing : but i do use the i do use the display of the time quite often , but industrial designer : yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote . marketing : yeah ."
