phd h : you know , you can put this button anywhere you want , professor b : oh ? oh , i see . phd h : and you can put it the bottom of the message and say `` here , by you know , by clicking on this , i i agree uh , you know , i acknowledge `` professor b : that i i my first - born children are yours , and yeah . yeah . phd e : quick question . are , um grad f : well , i could put a url in there without any difficulty and even pretty simple mime readers can do that . so . postdoc a : but why should n't they just email back ? i do n't see there 's a problem . professor b : yeah . grad f : yeah . reply . phd h : right . postdoc a : it 's very nice . i i like the high - tech aspect of it , professor b : yeah . postdoc a : but i think phd h : no , no , no . i actually do n't . postdoc a : i appreciate it . phd h : i 'm just saying that grad f : well , i cuz i use a text mail reader . phd h : if ev but i 'm phd e : do n't you use vi for your mai ? phd h : yeah . professor b : wow . that 's that 's my guy . alright . grad f : you you read email in vi ? phd h : yeah . postdoc a : yeah . i like vi . phd h : so i i there 's these logos that you can put at the bottom of your web page , like `` powered by vi `` . grad d : yeah . i see . phd e : anyway , quick question . grad f : you could put wed bugs in the email . phd h : yeah . phd e : like , there were three meetings this time , or so or how many ? six ? but , no of different people . so i guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . but how i mean , it also depends on how many like , if we release this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ? in th grad f : well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready . phd e : i do n't know . oh . oh , ok . so this time was just the first chunk . ok . grad f : so . tha - that was my intention . it 's just yeah that we just happened to have a bunch all at once . phd e : well , that 's a good idea ."
