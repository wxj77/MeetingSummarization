    "answer": "project manager : so we 're now on to project process . now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . so , we 're actually now uh , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . industrial designer : marketing : uh-huh . project manager : so what did you and remembering that nobody 's just over the curtain . marketing : project manager : so , um marketing : finish your meeting now . industrial designer : we should just go through this quickly and then project manager : so marketing : yeah . project manager : i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which i will do . marketing : okay . project manager : so , uh i think i have to finish that page . right , okay , so marketing : oh . project manager : project evaluation . so , um creativity . did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough ? marketing : industrial designer : um , yeah . yeah . project manager : well um user interface : yeah . marketing : i thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary . project manager : individual meetings . how do you mean ? marketing : yeah . well , we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings , project manager : in you on your own . marketing : and they did n't the one meeting did n't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you 'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you 'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , project manager : um marketing : and i do n't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you 'd do that . you know , you 'd sort of you 'd probably present it at one or something like that . project manager : mm , the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . marketing : yeah . project manager : then you go away . you find out information . you then come back . you then discuss it . you then go and change things around , marketing : uh-huh . project manager : and then go back . so industrial designer : yeah , i suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time marketing : yeah . project manager : whereas , this time , you 're really getting it from a database source , industrial designer : and then diff things will be relevant . marketing : yeah . project manager : so it 's not uh well uh marketing : yeah . project manager : anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? user interface : marketing : project manager : i 've put , seemed okay . creativity , seemed okay . um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed . marketing : yeah . user interface : i think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . i mean a remote control is n't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . marketing : yeah , the thing itself . project manager : um user interface : i ca n't think of a better example at the minute . marketing : yeah . project manager : have could have used a different example pel to increase create creativity . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on . project manager : you have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . i mean it depends what sort of business you 're in , i guess . i mean this one seems . from the website it looks it 's quite innovative , but we 're coming up with some bucket shop product are n't we user interface : marketing : that 's , you know , fifteen quid . industrial designer : one of those things . like uh , companies can have like a range of products and project manager : i th i uh d industrial designer : i do n't know how it works but i guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of project manager : but the other thing is that uh they 're i 'm guessing that they 're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . i mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer marketing : yeah . project manager : um for um you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so what she 's doing is she 's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . and then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person 's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see joe bloggs , or whatever . so uh , and that was a project i suspect similar to this , because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work . and of course , you had the machine crashing industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and various things going wrong . so industrial designer : well , sh we look at the last slide , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : see if it 's got anything else . project manager : alright , industrial designer : i think there 's one one more to go . project manager : so we 've got uh marketing : yeah . i mean if you look at their products on their website here , real reaction , i mean it 's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . project manager : new ideas found , marketing : and project manager : did we find any , no . industrial designer : it was quite good with this um the white board , having that and the digital pens . project manager : alright . industrial designer : like , that 's something that made it a little easier . marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : leadership , teamwork . marketing : we did find a new idea , i mean sort of a kinetic remote control . i 've never seen one of them before . batteries , i think . so project manager : does industrial designer : voice recognition , especially not could project manager : you 've got voice recognition computers , marketing : mm yeah . project manager : that 's not remote controls . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : well it 's a different application of it . project manager : mm-hmm . okay , industrial designer : yeah , so it 's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . project manager : so how do you reckon teamwork went ? industrial designer : um marketing : that went okay , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , i guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm , yeah . project manager : to uh go uh reasonably well . okay . marketing : i do n't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything project manager : bit bit arbitrary . marketing : well , i mean i do n't think it i just do n't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . i mean , they 've got all these sort of , you know , high definition d_v_d_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and uh i 'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control does n't really fit in . project manager : so , we 're m we 're meant to comment on leadership and the means , e_ g_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . user interface : marketing : surely they they should produ project manager : and and new i new ideas found was the the other thing . user interface : well leadership 's a bit of a funny one , is n't it . marketing : yeah . user interface : but we ca n't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager . project manager : user interface : you were the leader . so our experience of leadership was n't really as much as yours . marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : now , i 'd much rather be in marketing user interface : marketing : project manager : but i certainly did n't get this uh computer to work as well as i would have liked . marketing : project manager : however , um alright uh means , so whiteboard um so really , it 's uh equipment . oh . marketing : yeah . it worked . user interface : yeah , very nice . marketing : comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but user interface : but i mean , i d i do n't i 'm not sure i see the value in these . i mean , they record what you 're writing , and then what do you do with it ? where do you get the recording ? do you plug the computer or something ? marketing : i think there 's a little there 's a little um chi industrial designer : so it 's not just for us , it 's for the experiment as a whole , so marketing : there 's a little there 's a little chip , i think you must plug it into something industrial designer : should we quickly look at the last slide ? marketing : and it produces a industrial designer : sh user interface : right . i think you watch a video of it kind of . marketing : i do n't know . whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you 've written or something , and page after page . project manager : right . new ideas found , so one or two . marketing : yeah . kinetic powered remote control . um , what was the other one ? user interface : voice um recognition thing . marketing : vo yeah . project manager : um and uh voice marketing : project manager : uh , was it voice activated um marketing : voice recognition , yeah . s project manager : recognition . marketing : almost . user interface : pretty much . marketing : to fill in these fill in these questionnaires project manager : right , so , uh are the costs within budget , marketing : oh no ."
