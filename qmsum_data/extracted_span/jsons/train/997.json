    "answer": "project manager : okay . uh good afternoon . this is our third meeting already . marketing : good afternoon . project manager : i hope you enjoyed your lunch . i did anyway . um let 's see . presentation three . okay this is um the second phase uh we 're going to discuss today . it 's the conceptual design meeting . and a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . uh conceptual specification of design . and also trend-watching . um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you 're going to show me in a few minutes . um but first i 'll show you the agenda . uh first the opening . then we have three presentations . uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . how we 're going to make it . and then we 're closing . we have about forty minutes . uh so i suggest let 's get started . uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? no ? everything fine ? that 's nice . then a little uh thing about the last meeting . uh these are the points um we agreed on . the requirements and the target market . uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . and we are going to use default materials . um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? maybe ? no ? these are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . and maybe we can uh work it out . and we 're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . so now everybody knows what we 're do we 're doing , um i suggest let 's get started with the presentations . so shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ? marketing : sure . project manager : okay . marketing : i 'll start off then . project manager : good luck . marketing : doh . 'kay i 'm uh gon na inform you about the trend-watching i 've done over the past few days . um we 've done some market research . we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . and um besides that um i deployed some trend-watchers to milan and paris to well get all of the newest trends . and i 've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . um okay these are some overall findings . um most important thing is the fancy design . um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . by innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . um for our um group , we 're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'kay these are some more group specific findings . uh the older people prefer dark colours . uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . um this leads us to some personal preferences . uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . just keep it simple and well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . so this would be very important that we at least include these features . um well the trend-watchers i consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . so you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . this is not really this is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . so they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . so it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . the wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . people with more money . uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . that would be all . project manager : okay . thank you . any questions about the the trends ? marketing : any questions ? user interface : mm no . project manager : no ? okay , we go on to the next one . user interface : um 'kay um yeah . uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . so uh um uh that 's w what i what i want to uh uh to do in uh our design . so um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . um the uh i found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . so maybe uh we can uh use uh that . um uh and uh using a little uh display . so um findings . um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . so uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . um uh let 's see . um yeah and uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . so uh it 's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . um and yeah overall um user-friendly . so uh using uh large large buttons . um it 's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . so uh uh yeah . and and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or a and uh yeah . television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . um let 's see . uh yeah . i was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who ca n't uh read small uh subtitles . so uh um yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we 've got um the buttons we have to use . the on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . and um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . so um made a little uh picture of uh it . um see . um yeah . just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . industrial designer : user interface : so um d display uh of it , it 's uh just a small display . uh um you can put it uh on top . um it 's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of looks at . so uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it 's uh on place where um the thumb of of the so you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . um it 's uh quite uh handy place . so um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh i think uh so uh the form of it so project manager : okay . user interface : and that 's it . project manager : uh thank you . industrial designer : okay . about the components design . um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . but if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . so i do n't think it 's really an option . uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . it 's really up the the design that we 're gon na use . it 's uh does n't uh imply any technical restrictions . uh as a case supplement , we could um , i thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . and the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we 're using an lcd uh screen . and as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it does n't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . form should follow function overall . um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . but depends on what we want . i think we should disc discuss that . um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . and the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . and that 's it . project manager : okay . thank you . so that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . mm . marketing : project manager : 'kay . so these are the points we have to discuss . um first i think we can talk about the energy source , since that 's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . uh so uh f i think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , i think . industrial designer : yes w there there are four options . we could use the basic normal battery . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh a hand dynamo . project manager : okay . industrial designer : but i do n't think that 's really an option . user interface : industrial designer : you do n't wan na swing before you can watch television . marketing : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh solar cells . but not every room is very light so it 's not a very good option . or the kinetic energy . project manager : yeah . okay . marketing : and how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? industrial designer : well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . marketing : you just you use it and it works . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : okay . well personally i do n't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . that 's true . marketing : and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . and i think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product . project manager : yeah . marketing : um wel user interface : what 's the function ? yeah f for loading up uh the batteries . marketing : yeah you could load up the batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . user interface : okay but uh it wo n't use uh much e energy uh i i believe . uh it 's uh just a small display so i believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . so i believe one battery uh is just enough . project manager : uh user interface : uh so project manager : uh well i think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . marketing : that 's true . project manager : and i do n't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . user interface : okay . project manager : so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . user interface : yeah . that 's true . yeah . project manager : and also what you said . um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : but i think it 's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . user interface : yeah . project manager : so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . user interface : okay . project manager : and then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . user interface : yeah . uh . project manager : that 's safe . marketing : i 'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? project manager : yeah . that 's a good point . industrial designer : mm i do n't have any information on pricing . so i 'll have to ask the manufacturing department . marketing : 'cause in our earlier um market research , if you 'd allow me to go to the flat board , smartboard . project manager : yeah , sure . go ahead . marketing : um so it was open here . um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . well you can see here , our target group would not do that . so if that would increase the price for which we 're selling our remote control i would greatly advise not to do it . project manager : yeah . marketing : i think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the project manager : yeah . marketing : younger people . user interface : 'kay . industrial designer : but that would also go for the lcd screen then i guess . it 's a bit higher percentage , but marketing : um well this is yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . so that does n't really mean they would n't pay extra for it . and on top of that the lcd screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : and i think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . project manager : easier to use ? no , i think that 's a good point . user interface : but uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh lcd sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ? marketing : um well this was for like an lcd screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones . user interface : okay . marketing : so pretty large . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : i personally think the lcd screen we wan na use , with the extra information , i think nobody has anything against it . because it 's just uh some extra information , and it 's easy to ignore as well . so if you do n't wan na use it you just do n't use it . user interface : yeah . project manager : and um yeah i think the um maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . and i do n't think the i do n't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . user interface : yeah . project manager : so that brings us back to the energy . if we do n't have the voice recognition , it will it wo n't use a lot of energy to use . um user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . and much cheaper as well . user interface : yeah . project manager : so industrial designer : and that 's the best choice . project manager : okay let me just choose for the battery . that brings us to the chip . industrial designer : well there is n't any choice there because we 're using the the the the display . project manager : just the advanced . industrial designer : so it 's got ta be advanced . marketing : 'kay . project manager : , advanced chip . and then we get to the point of the case . um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . uh if we wan na choose for wood or the black and grey . or both ? um as we saw there is not yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um but i think it will attract elderly people who wan na have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : look i 've got a new remote control , and uh industrial designer : user interface : uh i dunno . marketing : well and i think most important factor there is the wooden colour . so it would n't actually have to be wood , project manager : yeah . that 's right . marketing : if it 's just wood-coloured . project manager : but with colour was a lot more expensive ? or ? industrial designer : mm i dunno . project manager : you do n't know ? industrial designer : i 'll have to uh research . project manager : i think so because yeah . marketing : probably . project manager : it 's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . user interface : mm . uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . so um uh you 'cause uh yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . project manager : yeah . change the cases . yeah . user interface : maybe it 's possible uh possibility . so um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh project manager : you can sell the cases . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . i think that 's a very good option . because um then you can advertise as well with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : because that 's a it 's something extra , it 's something other remotes do n't have , user interface : yeah . project manager : which we can get a great advantage point . marketing : yeah that is true . project manager : so and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as well . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . we would have to look carefully into the design though . project manager : costs . marketing : 'cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . the more original one , or the more standard one . project manager : yeah . yeah . so marketing : so that would project manager : you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . marketing : well i would n't design a telephone industrial designer : marketing : but user interface : marketing : well no i think w we should just , we should then just design one um project manager : remote . marketing : one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . project manager : yeah . okay . marketing : so , but that should n't be too much of a problem . project manager : so everybody 's okay with the changing covers ? i think that 's a good uh good option . user interface : yeah . project manager : changing case covers . marketing : um i heard our industrial designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . project manager : yeah . marketing : could you explain that a little more ? industrial designer : well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . marketing : and what would single curved and double curved mean ? industrial designer : um it would just only affect the form , for as far as i know . so it 's j really just up to the design department what we 're gon na use . it does n't really matter for the price or the functionality . marketing : okay . so we can pretty much just do whatever we want . industrial designer : pick one you like , yes . project manager : mm . okay . marketing : 'kay . that 's good . project manager : uh but the form has to be um it has to it 's has to be possible to stand up ? or just only to lie down ? marketing : no just to lie down . user interface : okay . project manager : and the the cover of the the docking station is also marketing : we 'll go for that . project manager : on top of the television then ? or not ? marketing : well or besides it . project manager : and you can just yeah then click it in . that 's okay . um so the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ? um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : on the the board . does somebody have ideas for a form or user interface : uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it 's um not quite uh fancy . so um yeah . marketing : um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , user interface : yeah . marketing : so you could , so your thumb would be easily user interface : yeah . marketing : well uh i think that was a very good point 'cause i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause r_s_i_ . so that would be great for that . um i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . user interface : for uh uh for marketing : for left-handed users also . user interface : yeah yeah . mm . yeah we is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? and on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? or or is n't it ? marketing : for the volume . um well that could yeah we could do that but i 'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . project manager : usabili yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , user interface : yeah okay . project manager : and then it 's marketing : but if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . 'cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . project manager : but you have extra buttons . user interface : but project manager : so people can get confused . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : that is true . user interface : yeah . project manager : especially if they have the same writings on it . user interface : see um yeah . or we have to make a left uh for lefties project manager : ca n't we make uh ca n't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same user interface : and um project manager : functions as the normal one ? user interface : you mean um project manager : then you have to user interface : yeah if project manager : let 's see if i ca a blank one . and then you get here 's a little lcd screen . uh now i have to think . it 's a plus and a min . no it 's not very handy i think . because the plus and the min will be opposite user interface : mm no . project manager : and all kinds of user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : no that 's not gon na work . i guess . maybe we should user interface : um project manager : yeah . but is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? i think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel marketing : yeah . that is true . project manager : or user interface : yeah . it 's just uh u using uh your thumb . project manager : y yeah . yeah . user interface : so um it 's project manager : i think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . in one or ano another way . user interface : yeah . um industrial designer : i think we should start by by choosing a case . because that 's the basis you 're building on . user interface : yeah yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : um yeah industrial designer : so i could draw them out . project manager : just industrial designer : let 's look at the flat case . oh . it 's from the side so it 's rather normal . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the the single curved so i 'm not really sure what they 're gon na look like , but i think it 's something like this . so this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . project manager : easier ? industrial designer : and the double curved s looks something like this i guess . so th those are the three options we have . project manager : 'kay . i suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it 's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . user interface : so um do you say this um s uh uh you got like uh sort of a i believe there ? marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : so um you want to put a display over here ? or not ? project manager : yeah . i think so . yeah . user interface : yeah . um yeah . uh project manager : but now it 's user interface : we can make it um project manager : do you have it upside down or do you have it user interface : that 's the top . project manager : this that 's top ? okay . user interface : so uh this top . this down . um maybe it 's possible to uh make this side like um let 's see . um colour uh okay . uh to make this side um like mm the right colour . project manager : user interface : um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . so um uh it 's an project manager : yeah . user interface : so so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . so uh it 's possib um yeah for s so and project manager : so get your mouse . yeah . user interface : and to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh project manager : yeah . that 's a good one . but i think it 's better to put the screen uh on top . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : uh rem project manager : so just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here . user interface : yeah but this place um project manager : if you can have this one , you turn it like this . and then flip it upside down . user interface : uh it 's yeah i dunno um project manager : because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : it 's more logical to have it on top as well project manager : i think i industrial designer : because , like on your mobile phone , it 's always above . user interface : yeah so project manager : on top . marketing : yeah . user interface : so project manager : yeah . user interface : industrial designer : oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page . project manager : . so marketing : yeah . project manager : then we get here 's that 's the curve . user interface : five minutes . project manager : here the display , and then buttons . yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . just that 's for left hand and right hand users . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and then h the rest of the buttons over here . user interface : yeah . but um the on-off button , um still on the top uh project manager : yeah still here user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : that 's marketing : and i 'd prefer the corners to be round . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . 'kay . project manager : should be more bit more friendly , marketing : think that would be better . project manager : yeah . marketing : friendly on the eye . project manager : 'kay . supplements . that 's okay . where 's my mouse ? then we 've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we 're going to use . so now for the next meeting uh we 'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . it 's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . so check out the corporate website maybe . the user interface design , it 's the same story . and product evaluation . so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one . but you 're going to get your instructions i think sended by the coach . so just um i will put these um minutes on the in the folder . industrial designer : okay . project manager : and then we 're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , i think . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : project manager : which are uh let 's see . i 'm not sure if you 're going to start right away to work together or i think you 're going to fill in the questionnaires first . user interface : yeah . project manager : and then you 'll get a message . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : so that 's uh basically it . maybe this one ? then we can save this one in the folders group . uh yes , it 's here . marketing : yeah . project manager : smartboard , there it it . so if you wan na have a look at it , it 's over there in the projects folder . user interface : yeah . project manager : and then i guess we 'll start in thirty minutes again . thank you . marketing : very good ."
