    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year .",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : yes . so , if you look at it\u2014with the usual caveats about whether you can make direct comparisons on level 2 plus between the exams the year before and the exams that we had last summer\u2014on the face of it , the gap has increased . i think what 's important to recognise , hefin , is a direction of travel . i 'm sure we all want to , because i want to , have a discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year . but , if we look at the period that we have been employing pdg , over that period , we have seen a narrowing of the gap . i think what 's quite stark , if we think about it\u2014 . so , if we look at where we started from : in 2009 , one in five children on free school meals got level 2 plus\u2014one in five\u2014by 2016 , we had got that down to one in three . obviously , there 's still a way to go , but , sir alasdair , who knows about these things , says that that is a significant improvement . last year , we got some challenges . we need to understand why that happened , but i do think it's\u2014 hefin david am : why , do you think ? kirsty williams am : why , do i think ? what i do think is there is no one answer . there is no one answer to this . i think we could look at and we can have discussions around the move from btec to science gcses . i think we have supplied figures to the committee about the significant change in the number of children on free school meals who were n't doing a single science gcse and are now doing science gcses . we can look at the unintended consequences of literature . again , we 've supplied figures . where children have done language and literature , whether that be through the medium of english or through the medium of welsh , there is more resilience . so , it 's that exposure to literacy in all its forms that i think could potentially make a difference . so , i think there 's no one answer to why free-school-meal children were not so resilient last year . we continue to have discussions with qualifications wales to get a better understanding of this . at my next ministerial policy board , in may , we 'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject . hefin david am : so , to what extent would exam boards be responsible for lack of grade stability ? kirsty williams am : it could be one of the contributory factors . what i think is important is that there is no one , single reason why there seems to be less resilience in this cohort of children . hefin david am : will you be speaking to the exam boards about this and raising concerns ?"
