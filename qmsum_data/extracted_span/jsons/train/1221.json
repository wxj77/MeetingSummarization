    "query": "<s> why did llyr gruffydd disagree with eluned morgan when discussing the official commitments to help the wales universities to get through the transition period ?",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : okay , right . we 'll move on , then , to questions from llyr . llyr gruffydd am : thank you . i just wanted to pick up on the funding of apprenticeships and the long-term funding , because the esf\u2014the commitments take us to 2023 , which takes us beyond any transition period . so , i just want to hear from you that there are assurances that the apprenticeship programme can be delivered as a whole , come what may . eluned morgan am : well , we 're fine until 2020 , because we 've had that guarantee from the government . the issue for us is the n+2 that we would have if we do have some kind of transition deal or an agreement with the eu . so , there is a risk and there is concern , beyond 2020 , that that would create problems if they do n't agree to fund that , which is the expectation that we have . llyr gruffydd am : but it is a prospect that this would n't be achieved as you foresee . eluned morgan am : well , we do hope , because we 've had the pledges and commitments from the government , that they will respect what we expected and what was expected by these institutions that have had the commitment of the funding . llyr gruffydd am : so , to what extent does that undermine the current work ? because institutions want to enter into agreements with providers and so on . businesses want to know , if they 're starting on some sort of journey , that they are going to get to the end of it some years down the line . that must be undermining a lot of the work that 's going on now . eluned morgan am : well , as i said , because the guarantee is there until 2020 , i think that , for now , people are willing to go into those agreements , and i hope that we 'll have a better outlook by november of the direction we 're moving in . but i do n't think it 's had an impact . you have to remember that the number of apprenticeships in wales is rising , while they 've collapsed entirely in england . so , it is important that we do continue , and it 's important that we do n't create an atmosphere here that 's going to undermine the confidence of our employers in committing to training in the workplace . llyr gruffydd am : are you confident that the government will achieve its targets in this context ?"
