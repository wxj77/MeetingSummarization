    "query": "<s> what did dr frank atherton said about legislation to build a healthy environment ?",
    "answer": "dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . in the draft plan , some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks , and that sort of thing . do you think that , if we go down that road , there 's going to be time within this assembly to introduce such legislation ? and , if not , what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation ? dr frank atherton : it may well be that there are things in wales that we might wish to legislate on , and you 've mentioned two of them , and they 're good examples . we would , obviously , need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and , in a way , we need to mirror what 's happening in england and in scotland to some degree around the consultations they 're having on energy drinks . we also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that . as to your question of legislative time , i 'm not really in a position to answer that . what i could say is that legislation may well be one of the outcomes of the consultation . there may well be things that we wish to choose to legislate on . the timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures , and i come back to the point that legislation , of course , is one of the tools that we 've got\u2014we need to deploy them all . dawn bowden am : sure , i understand that , that you could do other things . i know\u2014 . we 've heard from the government , on other calls for legislation , that the programme 's very tight , certainly for this term , so i was just wondering whether we might get that in , but okay . if i turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of ; i 'd just welcome your view on this , because , when we discussed with stakeholders , we talked about whether the planning system , for instance , could be used to , as an example , restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on . would that be a measure that you would support , something like that ?"
