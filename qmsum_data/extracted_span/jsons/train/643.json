    "query": "<s> which groups were thanked for their efforts ?",
    "answer": "ms. yasmin ratansi ( don valley east , lib . ) : mr . chair , our government has shown leadership during the covid-19 pandemic by ensuring that canadians remain safe and get the financial assistance they need . eight million canadians are receiving the canada emergency response benefit . the canada emergency business account and the canada emergency wage subsidy ensure that the economy is ready to start up post-pandemic . seniors received top-ups to the oas and gis , and families , the child care benefit . all of these measures are helping thousands of seniors and low-income families in my riding of don valley east . the feedback from my regular virtual town halls has also helped to fine-tune many of the programs . many canadians have shown generosity during this crisis . i want to particularly thank saravanaa bhavan and happy pops for donating food and frozen treats to our superhero front-line workers at local hospitals . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll now go to the honourable member for vaughanwoodbridge , mr. sorbara . mr. francesco sorbara ( vaughanwoodbridge , lib . ) : mr . chair , even though this year 's festivities for italian heritage month will be done differently , the same spirit and vitality exists throughout virtual events happening across the country . virtual events have seen italian canadians , through their generosity , raise over $ 1 million to help italy during covid-19 . today , june 2 , italian citizens celebrate the founding of the modern day italian republic . the italian canadian story remains one of passion , an adopted homeland filled with hard work , sacrifice and optimism . generations of italian canadians have contributed much to shaping the inclusive and generous canada that we know today . our diversity is our strength , and i 'm proud to be italian canadian . let 's all join together in proudly celebrating italian heritage month . thank you , mr . chair . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll now go to the honourable member for calgary skyview , ms. sahota . ms. jag sahota ( calgary skyview , cpc ) : mr . chair , as communities begin to ease restrictions , i remain mystified that , according to this government , parliament is not an essential service . if it were up to the prime minister , he would not have to answer to anyone . that is not how democracy works . we in the opposition have been long calling for the return of parliament , which would be possible while still maintaining public health guidelines . canadians deserve to be represented in the house of commons by the elected member of parliament . while the work we do in our constituencies is incredibly important , it is equally important to bring those voices back to ottawa to debate , to question and to hold the government to account . this is fundamental to the role of an elected representative . the role of the opposition is crucial now more than ever when billions of dollars are being spent with little oversight . our role as members of parliament is to uphold our democracy and to be present . this is the greatest pandemic in our lifetime . now is not the time to hide behind a podium . if this government were doing the best job for canadians , they would not need to hide . thank you . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll now go to the honourable member for brampton east , mr. sidhu . mr. maninder sidhu ( brampton east , lib . ) : mr . chair , i would like to take a moment to highlight displays of generosity in my riding of brampton east . this is just a small sample of the many individuals and organizations that have stepped up across canada . khalsa aid has been providing food supplies with the help of sperenza banquet hall , which has graciously provided the space to run a province-wide campaign out of brampton east . care4cause has sent hundreds of prepared meals on a weekly basis to good shepherd ministries to lessen their load . navraj brar at pharmasave has offered free care packages to health care workers and hand sanitizer to the peel regional police . aujla salon and spa has partnered with globalmedic to help deliver over 10,000 pounds of food to local food banks . i would also like to point out the heroic efforts of our truck drivers , taxi drivers , grocery store clerks , nurses , doctors , paramedics and countless other front-line heroes . we see you and we are immensely grateful for the bravery you display each and every day . thank you to everyone in brampton east who has stepped up for their neighbour in their time of need . you are setting a great example of the kind of progress we can make as canadians when we come together and support each other . i am truly honoured to represent you in ottawa . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll now go to the honourable member for wellingtonhalton hills , mr. chong . hon . michael chong ( wellingtonhalton hills , cpc ) : mr . chair , the house of commons is shut down . let 's be clear . this is not the house of commons . it 's a committee where only statements , petitions and questions are allowed . there is no power to introduce motions , to test confidence or to vote . the government came to office promising greater democracy but they broke their promise on electoral reform . they tried to give the pmo the control over this house in motion 6 , and yesterday 's report confirms that they rigged the leaders debate in their favour in the last election . now they 've shuttered parliament . parliament sat through two world wars , the october crisis and previous pandemics and it survived the test , but not now . the people 's representatives need to sit . people need their representation . parliament and this house of commons with its full powers needs to reopen and it needs to reopen now . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable member for reginaqu'appelle . hon . andrew scheer : mr . chair , these past few months have been tremendously difficult for so many canadians : sickness , losing loved ones , job losses , economic hardships , loneliness and isolation . the pandemic has taken its toll on so many . it is in these times of suffering and adversity that we have seen canadians coming together to support each other and that brings us hope . mosques , churches , synagogues and gurdwaras have all answered the call to help their communities . whether it 's providing meals to the hungry , clothing for the cold , or technology for those who need it most , these actions are true reflections of the kindness and generosity that canadians are known for . while there are too many groups to mention them all , i want to thank vikas sharma and care4cause out of brampton for the meals that they have been providing their community in that area and across the gta . this group and thousands of others like it across the country are working tirelessly to ease the suffering of others and help those in need . thank you , and god bless all the volunteers . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : now we will go to the honourable member for winnipeg centre . ms. gazan , go ahead ."
