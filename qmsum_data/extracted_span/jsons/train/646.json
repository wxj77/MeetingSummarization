    "answer": "mr. mel arnold : mr . chair , it took months for dfo to realize that fish passage on the fraser river was blocked at big bar . then it took them seven more months to tender a contract to clear the blockage . now that contract has tripled from $ 17.6 million to over $ 52.5 million without a single communications post from the minister 's office . the original contract amount was clearly inadequate , so who ordered it ? hon . bernadette jordan ( south shorest . margarets , lib . ) : mr . chair , since we found out about the landslide at big bar , our government has been extremely active in making sure that the salmon have a passage through . we know how critically important the salmon are to the fraser river , as well as to the indigenous communities along the fraser . we 're working diligently to make sure that we get that passage cleared . so far , we 've made significant progress , but we know there 's more work that needs to be done . that 's why we 'll continue to work with indigenous communities and the province to make sure that these mr. mel arnold : mr . chair , the fisheries minister 's mandate letter from november of last year directed her to make new investments in fighting invasive species . half a year later , the minister has failed to deliver . canadians on the front line of prevention wrote the minister , and when they got a response five months later , it was devoid of any help . this government 's delays are hurting canada 's fight against invasive species . when will the minister follow her prime minister 's directive and make new investments in the fight against invasive species ? hon . bernadette jordan : mr . chair , i want to thank my hon . colleague for the question . invasive species are a real challenge for our waterways . we know that a lot more has to be done . we 're working diligently to find the answers to deal with some of the problems we are seeing from invasive species . we are continuing to monitor situations in waterways . i am committed to making sure that i meet my commitments within my mandate letter , and i will have more to say on that soon . mr. mel arnold : mr . chair , the list of hunting and sport shooting firearms banned by minister blair 's order in council continues to grow . what other hunting firearms does he plan to ban ? hon . bill blair : mr . chair , to be very clear , the weapons we have prohibited are weapons that were not designed for hunting or sport shooting but for soldiers to use in combat . as law enforcement leaders right across the country have said many times , they have no place in our community , and we agree . mr. mel arnold : mr . chair , i continue to hear from constituents in the north okanaganshuswap who are unable to access supports under the canada emergency business account or the emergency commercial rent assistance program . business owners have also lost employees and ca n't get them to come back to work because of the lack of flexibility in the emergency response benefit and the emergency student benefit . when the liberals shut down parliament , they removed our ability to amend legislation and fix their failures . when will the government fix these problems and the programs ?"
