    "answer": "darren millar am : yes , it is on this . i was just wondering\u2014 . i mean , one of the problems that i know you 've identified in the past is this lack of good practice being able to travel into all parts of wales , and , of course , we 've got local authorities , we 've got regional consortia , we 've got the welsh government\u2014all of which want to see good practice replicated where possible . what opportunities are there , perhaps , to develop some other further opportunities for good practice to be shared and promoted ? i know that the wales audit office , for example , has its good practice exchange . is there something similar that schools can engage with to make things happen ? meilyr rowlands : it 's a good question . i mean , specifically to do with foundation phase , there is a foundation phase\u2014i ca n't remember what it 's called now\u2014excellence network i think , which is being relaunched . i think it was supposed to be relaunched during the snow period . so , there are networks being established . there 's one for mathematics\u2014a national network for excellence in mathematics\u2014there 's one for science and there 's one for foundation phase in particular . so , i think it is a challenge that we have n't cracked yet in wales : how do we make sure that good practice does travel ? i think one specifically for foundation phase is a good idea , because we 've got a specific issue with the foundation phase . mark reckless am : when you say that\u2014 john griffiths am : mark , just before you go on , i think julie wanted to come in on this point as well . julie morgan am : yes . i just wondered if you could give us some examples about how the foundation phase is not being implemented in the true spirit of the foundation phase in the three quarters of schools that you think fall\u2014 . meilyr rowlands : well , what we mean by that is schools not necessarily teaching badly , but in a more traditional way . and where we 've seen that most obviously is in year 1 and year 2 . some schools actually reverted , after the introduction of the new tests , from what was pedagogy that was in line with the foundation phase . and basically , if i understand it correctly , it 's more to do with the children making their own choices about what they do . and that is pretty common in nursery and reception classes , but it 's less common in year 1 and year 2 ."
