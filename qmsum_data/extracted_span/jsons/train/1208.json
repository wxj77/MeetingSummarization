    "answer": "undergrad d : well the there 's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you 're really not being powered . so th there will be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people , uh , rewire things . grad a : right . phd b : yeah , i mean , we i had that last time . but uh there are actually that you know , there 's an extra there 's a mix out on the radio receiver ? undergrad d : mm - hmm . phd b : so there are actually six xlr outs on the back of the radio receiver and only five cables going in , i had the wrong five , so i ended up not recording one of the channels and recording the mix . undergrad d : how interesting . d did you do any recognition on the mix mix out ? wonder whether it works any phd b : but i subtracted the four that i did have from the mix and got a pretty good approximation of the @ @ . undergrad d : got the fifth ? cool . postdoc e : oh , how great . grad a : and did it work ? phd b : yeah . grad a : did it sound good ? phd b : it 's not bad . undergrad d : is it is phd b : it 's not bad , yeah . undergrad d : ai n't science wonderful ? postdoc e : that 's amazing . phd b : yeah . grad a : so what 's the schedule on these things ? undergrad d : so phd b : but , you always undergrad d : uh , well i was wrestling with th with literally the w number of connectors in the cable and the the , uh , powering system . and i i was gon na do this very clever phantom power and i decided a couple days ago not to do it . so i 'm ready to build it . which is to say , uh , the neighborhood of a week to get the circuit board done . grad a : mm - hmm . so i think the other thing i 'd like to do is , do something about the set up so that it 's a little more presentable and organized . undergrad d : i agree . grad a : and i 'm i 'm just not sure what that is . i mean , some sort of cabinet . undergrad d : well i can build a cabinet . the the difficulty for this kind of project is the intellectual capital to design the cabinet ."
