    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about industrial designer 's presentation on energy source and case material design of the remote control ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which would n't be v would n't be v v project manager : i do n't think any of us remember the fifties . user interface : is it like a crank thing or something . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . it would n't be very fancy . marketing : industrial designer : you can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . so if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . or you can use solar cells , but i 'm not sure about that indoors , really , but user interface : well , there 's sometimes combinations , i mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? does anybody know ? industrial designer : i dunno actually . user interface : uh i think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but i do n't know . industrial designer : i dunno . um . think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and uh if we want something fancier , i think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but i do n't know if it 's worth the cost . so we 've got to discuss that . project manager : mm . okay , jolly good . industrial designer : for the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . you can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what i mean , so project manager : what 's a double curved one ? industrial designer : you know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . and th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you ca n't use it for if you if we 're choosing a double curved case , we ca n't choose titanium . and if we are choosing um solar cells then we ca n't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . but if we 're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . and i think we discussed earlier on the r_ s_ i_ problem thing , so we could uh project manager : so that might be an idea of using the rubber , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : but then it should , you know user interface : let 's have a squeezable remote . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . and also it does n't break as easily maybe , project manager : when a tv programme 's got one industrial designer : i dunno user interface : project manager : watching the match and your team 's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it 'll bounce off the wall back at you . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , i like that idea . industrial designer : so rubber would be okay . marketing : i think rubber 's project manager : rubber , we 're all we 're all going we 're all liking that idea ? you think you can market that ? marketing : but after my after my fashion thing , i think you 'll realise that rubber is more project manager : ooh , we like rubber , ooh . industrial designer : uh s so if d marketing : people . industrial designer : okay . and then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um lcd , which gives you a display . um scroll buttons , as well . project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : so if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . so if we 're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . project manager : well , we 're gon na go with i think we 've decided that it 's gon na be a rubber case so industrial designer : so it 's a constraint . yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? if it 's not a double curved , then we 've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it 's a double curve , we 've got ta go for rubber push-buttons . if that makes sense . project manager : push buttons instead of the wheel ? industrial designer : yeah . . user interface : if it 's rubber , is n't it malleable anyway , it does n't matter if it 's double i mean is n't a rubber case , mean it 's completely flexed , i mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? mean so what 's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? project manager : rubble double double . industrial designer : no , but na le you see , you 've got , okay , the energy that 's one thing , project manager : i 'll have a big mac , please . industrial designer : then you have the case is uh , whether it 's flat or curved . and that 's we do n't care if it 's rub rubber or not , but then we 've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . so if we 've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it 's flat , single curved or double curved . and i 'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go i dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . so , either user interface : okay . industrial designer : i dunno we just need to decide on the on the case . project manager : let 's have rubber push buttons , hey . user interface : okay . go rubber . go rubber the whole way . industrial designer : let 's go crazy . and then , do i have a last slide ? yes , i do . um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that 's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gon na be the cheapest . uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that 's a higher price range . if we get an advanced chip which is um used for the lcd , the display thing , then that 's even more expensive . project manager : simple , yeah . chip on print . it 's a bit . okay , uh what i 'm not understanding here is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which i presume is like one p_c_b_ and that 's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? industrial designer : . yeah . marketing : industrial designer : the infra-red . yeah . project manager : right . um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? industrial designer : well , if if it 's not chip on print then , i guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and does n't include the infra-red . it 's less expensive mm project manager : so it sounds industrial designer : technically speaking , it 's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . project manager : so , why would we not go for that ? if it 's something that 's inside the the unit . i it does n't affects whether the customer 's gon na buy it or not . industrial designer : fo it does n't , yeah , yeah , yeah . totally . yeah . project manager : um we wan na go for an i i all industrial designer : so let 's not go for the project manager : so long as it works , industrial designer : yeah , yeah . i agree . project manager : you know . so let 's not let 's uh not bother with the chip on print . industrial designer : so it 's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . project manager : yeah . s yeah , push buttons . marketing : what about the just developed uh sample sensor ? user interface : i think push-buttons is project manager : what about what ? marketing : g there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . industrial designer : well project manager : well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? marketing : mm , i dunno . be cool . industrial designer : it 'd be it 'd be cool , but they are saying they 've just developed it , user interface : yeah . marketing : channel two . industrial designer : i 'm just guessing . but it 's gon na be the most expensive option , probably and user interface : th the the speech recognition um option is it does n't seem really very promising for us uh , project manager : yeah . it 's not something that we wan na t go into with this product . user interface : 'cause uh the yeah the example that they 're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um that when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . so you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello rick , or whatever . project manager : yeah . user interface : but , i mean , it 's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the tv on like , turn the tv on , and i turns comes on , but it 's not that . it just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response . marketing : oh , it just gives an answer . user interface : so , yeah , i mean , like what 's the point of saying , hello remote , i mean , hello , how how are you ? marketing : oh , then then project manager : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : just if you are really lonely , maybe . marketing : i thought i thought it was when they said user interface : yeah , if you 're really lonely , it is it 's marketing : i thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , industrial designer : channel five . and then it switches on . marketing : channel five , and it will change . user interface : no , tha that w that w that would be more promising . marketing : like you talk to it . can i have channel five ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : it it 's just a remote that talks to you . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : uh . i mean to certain cues . marketing : oh , then forget about it . oh right okay . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay , so i 'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . so for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the user interface : 'kay . yeah , i 'm fine with the basic battery . project manager : basic battery . it 's cheap , it 's cheerful , it 's worked , does work . industrial designer : cheaper option . are you happy with that ? marketing : mm . yeah . industrial designer : okay . so we 'll go for the battery . then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? project manager : we were go we were going with the late with the the r_s_i_ rubber , were n't we ? user interface : yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . project manager : the the marketing : so it will look like something like this . industrial designer : double ? project manager : the double whopper , please . industrial designer : okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , project manager : yep , but we 're going for the simple buttons . user interface : so rubber rubber keys , yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and that 's fine ? project manager : and it 's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it user interface : yeah . project manager : as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the r_ people were getting the complaining about r_s_i_ , and this is anti-r_s_i_ . marketing : . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : so that 's another marketing point that we can use . marketing : well the rubber push-buttons . do n't you have to move your project manager : but anything is gon na have buttons . even if it 's a jog wheel , it 's still repetitive . you industrial designer : i thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a project manager : you see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . industrial designer : that they do n't . project manager : it 's the v it 's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . user interface : . project manager : it 's not actually what you are doing . industrial designer : project manager : but the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-r_s_i_ ps specific user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , the rubber 's good . user interface : we 're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , so they can sit there and go like user interface : not that watching tv should be that stressful . project manager : and you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah . marketing : user interface : oh yeah , i guess tv can be stressful , yeah , if you 're watching sports . marketing :"
