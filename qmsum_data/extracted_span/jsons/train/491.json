    "answer": "ms. heather mcpherson ( edmonton strathcona , ndp ) : thank you , mr . chair , for the opportunity to represent my constituents virtually during this challenging period of physical distancing . i 'd like to start by asking about supports for workers . in alberta , meat-packing plants are directly responsible for nearly a quarter of all covid-19 cases . the government and management ignored the pleas of workers and did not put effective safety protocols in place to deal with covid-19 . now , two workers are dead , at least six more are in intensive care and covid-19 is spreading like wildfire through these communities . there are over 1,400 cases . yesterday , employees were forced back to work even though their concerns had not been addressed . on march 27 , regarding the cerb , the minister of finance said that if workers do n't feel comfortable in their work , if they decide to stay home , they can apply for the benefit , yet the website says differently . will the minister guarantee that every canadian receiving cerb , ei or the cesb will not lose their benefits if they refuse to return to work or to accept work that is unsafe due to covid-19 ? hon . chrystia freeland : let me thank the member , first of all , for her really very important question . i think all of us share the concern for canada 's essential workers who are keeping us safe , putting food on our tables and often working in difficult conditions . when it comes to the cargill plant , this is an issue that our government has been very closely engaged in . my colleague , the minister of agriculture , has spoken with her provincial counterpart and the head of the plant . the decisions about suspending and reopening are taken by local and provincial health authorities . to the question my colleague asked about workers , it is absolutely the case that no canadian should feel they need to work in an environment that is unsafe , and it is also very much the case that any canadian who is feeling unwell should stay at home . this is the way that collectively we take care of ourselves and we take care the chair : we will go on to ms. mcpherson for the next question . ms. heather mcpherson : i just want to be clear , because i 'm not a hundred per cent sure that i got an answer in that response , so i 'll try one more time . knowing that workers have a fundamental right to refuse unsafe work , can the minister confirm one hundred per cent that if workers refuse unsafe work , they will be able to access the cerb , or was the minister of finance incorrect when he spoke on march 27 ? the chair : the honourable minister . hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm sorry , but i was struggling with my mute button . i apologize . let me just be very clear . no canadian worker at any time should feel obliged to go to work in unsafe conditions . ms. heather mcpherson : but then could they access the cerb ? hon . chrystia freeland : in a time of coronavirus that is even more the case , and the government of course should not penalize workers for doing the right thing and declining to go to work in unsafe conditions . the chair : i want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the chair to avoid back and forth , just to try to keep some order in the meeting . ms. mcpherson , please continue . ms. heather mcpherson : i 'm sorry , chair . i have another question on the protection for workers . at the meat-packing plant , workers are calling for the plant to be shut down . in fact , we know that 85 % of workers are afraid for their safety . if the provincial government wo n't shut down the plant , will the federal government shut down unsafe plants through the canadian food inspection agency ?"
