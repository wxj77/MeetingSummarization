    "answer": "phd c : yeah . professor a : um , uh , ok . postdoc f : i i did i it did occur to me that this is uh , the return to the transcription , that there 's one third thing i wanted to to ex raise as a to as an issue which is , um , how to handle breaths . so , i wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know where the breaths are . and the reason i ask the question is , um , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode , uh , the fact that there was some i had the indication from dan ellis in the email that i sent to you , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : and you know about , that in principle we might be able to , um , handle breaths by accessi by using cross - talk from the other things , be able that in principle , maybe we could get rid of them , so maybe and i was i i do n't know , i mean we had this an and i did n't could n't get back to you , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : but the question of whether it 'd be possible to eliminate them from the audio signal , which would be the ideal situation , professor a : i do n't know think it 'd be ideal . postdoc f : cuz phd g : uh - uh . professor a : we - see , we 're we 're dealing with real speech and we 're trying to have it be as real as possible phd e : yeah . professor a : and breaths are part of real speech . postdoc f : well , except that these are really truly i mean , ther there 's a segment in o the one i did n the first one that i did for i for this , phd e : yeah . postdoc f : where truly w we 're hearing you breathing like as if we 're you 're in our ear , you know , and it 's like it 's like professor a : yeah . postdoc f : i y i i mean , breath is natural , but not professor a : it is but it is if you record it . phd c : yeah . postdoc f : except that we 're we 're trying to mimic oh , i see what you 're saying . you 're saying that the pda application would have uh , have to cope with breath . professor a : yeah . postdoc f : but phd g : an - any application may have to . grad b : the p d a might not have to , phd e : no i grad b : but more people than just pda users are interested in this corpus . phd e : yeah . grad b : so so mean you 're right postdoc f : ok , then the then i have two questions . grad b : we could remove it , postdoc f : yeah ? grad b : but i i think we do n't wan na w remove it from the corpus , in terms of delivering it because the people will want it in there . professor a : yeah . if it gets postdoc f : ok , so maybe the question is notating it . yeah ? professor a : yeah i right . if if it gets in the way of what somebody is doing with it then you might wan na have some method which will allow you to block it , but you it 's real data . you do n't wan na b but you do n't postdoc f : ok , well professor a : if s you know , if there 's a little bit of noise out there , and somebody is is talking about something they 're doing , that 's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting , even and we have the f uh the uh the the fan and the in the projector up there , and , uh , this is it 's this is actual stuff that we we wan na work with . postdoc f : well this is in very interesting because i it basically has a i it shows very clearly the contrast between , uh , speech recognition research and discourse research because in in discourse and linguistic research , what counts is what 's communit communicative . phd g : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and breath , you know , everyone breathes , they breathe all the time . and once in a while breath is communicative , but r very rarely . ok , so now , i had a discussion with chuck about the data structure professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and the idea is that the transcripts will that get stored as a master there 'll be a master transcript which has in it everything that 's needed for both of these uses . professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and the one that 's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts . you know , like , don 's been writing scripts professor a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and and , uh , to process it for the speech recognition side . discourse side will have this this side over he the we we 'll have a s ch sorry , not being very fluent here . but , um , this the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative . ok . so then the then let 's let 's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths . so what i would r r what i would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically ? could we get a breath detector ? grad b : oh , just to save the transcribers time . postdoc f : well , i mean , you just have no idea . i mean , if you 're getting a breath several times every minute , grad b : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate , to put the boundaries in , to to type it in , i it 's just a huge amount of time . grad b : mm - hmm . phd e : oops . professor a : wh - what phd c : yeah . postdoc f : and you wan na be sure it 's used , and you wan na be sure it 's done as efficiently as possible , and if it can be done automatically , that would be ideal . professor a : what if you put it in but did n't put the boundaries ? postdoc f : well , but professor a : so you just know it 's between these other things , postdoc f : well , ok . so now there 's there 's another another possibility professor a : right ? postdoc f : which is , um , the time boundaries could mark off words { comment } from nonwords . and that would be extremely time - effective , if that 's sufficient . professor a : yeah i mean i 'm think if it 's too if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , we are gon na be building up models for these things and these things are somewhat self - aligning , so if so , we i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a `` breath `` or a `` breath - in `` or `` breath - out `` , the models will learn that sort of thing . uh , so but you but you do want them to point them at some region where where the breaths really are . so postdoc f : ok . but that would maybe include a pause as well , phd g : well , there 's a there 's postdoc f : and that would n't be a problem to have it , uh , pause plus breath plus laugh plus sneeze ? professor a : yeah , i you know there is there 's this dynamic tension between between marking absolutely everything , as you know , and and and marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods . basically the more we can mark the better . but if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area , and this might be one like this although i i i 'd be interested to h get get input from liz and andreas on this to see if they cuz they 've - they 've got lots of experience with the breaths in in , uh , uh , their transcripts . grad b : they have lots of experience with breathing ? phd g : i professor a : actually well , yes they do , but we we can handle that without them here . but but but , uh , you were gon na say something about phd g : yeah , i i think , um , one possible way that we could handle it is that , um , you know , as the transcribers are going through , and if they get a hunk of speech that they 're gon na transcribe , u th they 're gon na transcribe it because there 's words in there or whatnot . if there 's a breath in there , they could transcribe that . phd e : yeah . yeah . postdoc f : that 's what they 've been doing . so , within an overlap segment , they they do this . phd g : right . but right . but if there 's a big hunk of speech , let 's say on morgan 's mike where he 's not talking at all , um , do n't do n't worry about that . phd e : yeah . phd g : so what we 're saying is , there 's no guarantee that , um so for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed . but outside of those boundaries , there could have been stuff that was n't transcribed . so you just somebody ca n't rely on that data and say `` that 's perfectly clean data `` . uh do you see what i 'm saying ?"
