    "answer": "the chair : we will go to mr. lloyd . mr. dane lloyd : mr . chair , it has been months since the liberals shut down this parliament and months since the minister of finance should have presented a budget or at least an economic update to canadians . since then we have seen billions spent with little oversight and no plan . the minister says that he needs certainty before he can table a budget . well , that did n't stop stephen harper and the conservatives from tabling a budget in the depth of the last great recession . when are these liberals finally going to take their job seriously and table an economic update ? hon . mona fortier ( minister of middle class prosperity and associate minister of finance ) : mr . chair , we 're taking this very seriously . we 're working for canadians and bringing forward supports to make sure that businesses , workers and canadians can put food on the table and pay their rent . we will continue to support canadians , and when we have a clear projection to present , we will do that . mr. dane lloyd : mr . chair , the results are in , and businesses are n't happy with the so-called support programs from these liberals . in fact , the oil and gas industry has been shut out of many of these economic programs . when is the government going to recognize that their business support plans have been an absolute failure with only a fraction of the billions promised being accessible to businesses ? hon . seamus o'regan ( minister of natural resources ) : mr . chair , our government has taken swift and immediate action to support our sector throughout this challenging time . we had the bcap , which is critically important to providing liquidity to support the smes that make up 85 % of the jobs in our sector . it has taken an enormous team effort . people are working around the clock to get money where it needs to be . we are helping hard-working canadians , small businesses and large businesses right across the country , but in particular in our energy sector . mr. dane lloyd : mr . chair , i 'm pleased to see the minister of natural resources online . he tweeted recently to praise the alberta carbon trunk line and the north west redwater partnership refinery in my riding . can the minister tell us what , if any , support they have given to the innovative carbon capture and sequestration technology in this country ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr . chair , we see carbon capture and sequestration as an integral part of lowering emissions , making emissions more competitive and making our oil and gas industry more competitive . we 're seeing where the investment dollars are going . they are going to jurisdictions that are committed to lowering emissions . obviously , this government is committing to net zero . mr. dane lloyd : i note that the minister could n't name a single example of government support for carbon capture , utilization and sequestration technology . we have spent a lot of time talking about the covid-19 pandemic , but canadians are living with another horrific reality , that being the intensifying opioid overdose epidemic . reports indicate that in the past four years , 14,000 canadians have died , and the numbers during covid-19 have been skyrocketing , with british columbia seeing a 39 % increase this year alone . i know this because i 've lost a family member to a fentanyl overdose . when is the government going to take this scourge seriously and take action to save the lives of canadians ? hon . patty hajdu : mr . chair , i share the member 's deep sadness about the number of lives we 've lost to opioid overdose . our government has been steadily making it easier for people who live with substance use to access medications to treat substance use , such as prescription suboxone and methadone . we have made it easier to rapidly establish safe injection sites in communities and have supported community-based projects that work with people who are using substances . we need to understand that this is a complex issue , and we need to support people to get the help they need . the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ( algomamanitoulinkapuskasing , ndp ) ) : the hon . member for thrse-deblainville . ms. louise chabot ( thrse-de blainville , bq ) : madamchair , i will come back to the bill introduced last week . as parliamentarians , we felt like we were watching a very bad play , as i imagine the public did . i say that it was theatre , even though it should n't be in this place . the government decided to stage a play and act alone and , unfortunately , there were several acts missing . a very important part of this bill was about supporting people with disabilities in this time of crisis . however , the government did not see fit to negotiate with the opposition parties , even though it is in a minority position . despite this arrogance , the bloc qubcois proposed solutions . one of the things we proposed was to split the bill so that we could give this support to people with disabilities , but the conservatives did not want to do that . we came back and asked for time to negotiate and give support to people with disabilities , but the government defeated the motion . we asked that the house be recalled today so that we could pass this part of the bill concerning support for people with disabilities , but we are still in the dark . why are we abandoning people with disabilities ? hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : i thank the hon . member for her question . we know this pandemic has deeply affected the lives and health of all canadians and has disproportionately affected canadians with disabilities in particular . from the very beginning , we 've taken a disability-inclusive approach to our emergency response to ensure that canadians with disabilities get the support they need . that is why we announced a one-time payment of $ 600 for persons with disabilities to address these expenses . this will go a long way toward helping canadians with disabilities . we encourage and urge all parties in the opposition to support this measure . we 're confident that this measure , along with other investments , will benefit canadians with disabilities , and we hope to get the support of the other parties very soon . ms. louise chabot : madamchair , i remind you that this measure was n't passed because we were n't allowed to do so . a measure to help people with disabilities has been put in an omnibus bill . we 've tried here , in the house , to provide the means to give that support , so i ask again , can the government be counted on to give a response to people with disabilities ? hon . pablo rodriguez : madamchair , it was absolutely not an omnibus bill . it contained assistance for the disabled , of course , but it also contained assistance for our seasonal workers , as well as a number of other measures that the bloc qubcois opposed . they refused to debate and , when the question of splitting the bill came up , the conservatives refused to do that . that is why there is no bill at the moment , and that is very unfortunate . ms. louise chabot : it was a bloc qubcois proposal to split the bill . the government had not thought of it , but they found that it was a good idea . let me return to the attack . this bill proposed changes to the wage subsidy program , it was supposed to make the cerb more flexible , it proposed fines for fraudsters and , since there was a little section about a benefit for the disabled , the government took it for granted that we would support it without any negotiations with the parties . however , we set one very important condition : that the liberal party must get its hands out of taxpayers ' pockets in terms of the wage subsidy . hon . pablo rodriguez : madamchair , as we listen to the bloc qubcois members , we might think that they invented peanut butter and apple pie . this bill contained a number of measures that all quebeckers and all canadians needed , but the bloc qubcois refused to debate it . no , we did not follow the bloc qubcois ' example in splitting the bill ; we had thought of it a long time previously . we have not been able to do that because of the conservatives . because of them , we can not help those living with disabilities . the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : ms.chabot , you have 45seconds left . ms. louise chabot : we asked on a number of occasions for the house to be able to sit starting today to pass the part of the bill dealing with those with disabilities . what is the status of that , madamchair ? we have not heard about it since . hon . pablo rodriguez : madamchair , my colleague knows very well that things are not as simple as that . there are procedural mechanisms unique to the house . i hope that , one day , we will be able to pass this bill and be able to provide assistance for those living with disabilities . i hope that the conservatives will change their minds and give us their support ."
