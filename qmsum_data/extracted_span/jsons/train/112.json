    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about differences of care provision in different parts of wales ?",
    "answer": "janet finch-saunders am : thank you , chair . what is the welsh government doing to address the big differences in the amount of early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of wales ? julie morgan am : right . well , thank you very much for that question . i mean , obviously , it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency , but i think it 's important to acknowledge that there are reasons for that variation . now , early education , of course , is the responsibility of the minister for education , and we are aware that different local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education . for example , local authorities are funded to provide 10 hours minimum of the foundation phase for three and four-year-olds across wales , but there 's quite a variance in how much is actually provided , with some local authorities providing a lot more historically . so , it does mean that there is a different pattern across wales , according to what local authorities do . but what i could say is , of course , the quality is very good , as the estyn reports have shown ; that the quality provided , the delivery of the foundation phase , is very good . but it does vary in terms of what is offered throughout wales , and that is the decision of the local authorities , and it is a historical thing . i refer to this pilot in flint , which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare . we 're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon , in november this year , so that will help us . obviously , i think local authorities ' role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local , nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas . and then , of course , we 've got flying start , which is geographically targeted , which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered . and that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households . so , again , that determines the pattern throughout wales . with flying start being geographically targeted , with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is , we know that there is a variance throughout wales . we 'd like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas . lynne neagle am : before you move on , janet , si\u00e2n 's got a supplementary . sian gwenllian am : just in terms of the foundation phase , there have been cuts , of course , in expenditure in that phase . how concerned are you about that and the impact that that will have on the way in which the foundation phase is taught in our schools ? the foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant , which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent , and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding . so , are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase ? julie morgan am : i have n't seen any evidence . obviously , i must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the minister for education , but i have n't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered , and the reports from estyn are very good . in fact , i think the foundation phase is one of our great joys , that we absolutely celebrate it , and so i 'd be very concerned if i thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase , and i certainly have n't had any evidence of that . i would want to guard against that . sian gwenllian am : exactly , but if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system because of the cuts , it 's going to impact on standards , at the end of the day . julie morgan am : i think we have to be very careful to see that lower standards are not implemented , because it was groundbreaking when we brought it in , and it has proved to be a great success , so we want to make sure that 's guarded . lynne neagle am : thank you . janet . janet finch-saunders am : going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of wales , the welsh and uk governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market , with subsidies mainly given to working parents . is that a mistake ? should it be more universally available ? julie morgan am : well , some of our provision is universally available in certain areas . for example , the flying start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas , and i think that 's very important , because that does mean that there is n't stigma , and so , in those areas , everybody can take advantage of it , and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it 's reaching those areas . so , i think that there is a purpose behind that . in terms of when you say demand led , could you elaborate on that ? janet finch-saunders am : i know that\u2014we 've just had a useful briefing from david dallimore , and , basically , there is this theory that there are too many resources\u2014the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors : geographic spread in terms of it being more universal , and whether that 's the right way . how do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds , in their own peer or age group ? julie morgan am : it is demand\u2014 nicola edwards : [ inaudible . ] \u2014because the offer is targeted at working parents\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : yes , yes . nicola edwards : \u2014obviously , then the amount of availability is based on how many parents apply for it and take it up . is that the context of demand led in that\u2014 right , okay . julie morgan am : it is universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working , and i think what you 're saying is that it should be available to everybody ."
