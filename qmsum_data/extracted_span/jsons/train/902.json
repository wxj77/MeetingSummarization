    "answer": "phd c : so the frame - dropping is the last thing that we do . so , yeah , what we do is we compute the silence probability , convert it to that binary flag , professor b : uh - huh . phd c : and then in the end you c up upsample it to match the final features number of phd e : mm - hmm . phd a : did that help then ? phd c : it seems to be helping on the well - matched condition . so that 's why this improvement i got from the last result . so . and it actually r reduced a little bit on the high mismatch , so in the final weightage it 's b b better because the well - matched is still weighted more than professor b : so , @ @ i mean , you were doing a lot of changes . did you happen to notice how much , uh , the change was due to just this frame - dropping problem ? what about this ? phd c : uh , y you had something on it . right ? phd e : just the frame - dropping problem . yeah . but it 's it 's difficult . sometime we we change two two things together and but it 's around maybe it 's less than one percent . professor b : uh - huh . phd c : yeah . phd e : it professor b : well . but like we 're saying , if there 's four or five things like that then pretty sho soon you 're talking real improvement . phd e : yeah . yeah . and it yeah . and then we have to be careful with that also with the neural net professor b : yeah . phd e : because in { comment } the proposal the neural net was also , uh , working on after frame - dropping . professor b : mm - hmm . oh , that 's a real good point . phd e : so . well , we 'll have to be to do the same kind of correction . professor b : it might be hard if it 's at the server side . right ? phd e : mmm . well , we can do the frame - dropping on the server side or we can just be careful at the terminal side to send a couple of more frames before and after , and so . i think it 's ok . phd a : you have , um so when you uh , maybe i do n't quite understand how this works , but , um , could n't you just send all of the frames , but mark the ones that are supposed to be dropped ? cuz you have a bunch more bandwidth . right ? professor b : well , you could . yeah . i mean , it it always seemed to us that it would be kind of nice to in addition to , uh , reducing insertions , actually use up less bandwidth . phd a : yeah . yeah . professor b : but nobody seems to have cared about that in this evaluation . phd a : and that way the net could use if the net 's on the server side then it could use all of the frames . phd c : yes , it could be . it 's , like , you mean you just transferred everything and then finally drop the frames after the neural net . phd a : mm - hmm . phd c : right ? yeah . that 's that 's one thing which phd e : mm - hmm . phd a : but you could even mark them , before they get to the server . phd c : yeah . right now we are uh , ri right now what wha what we did is , like , we just mark we just have this additional bit which goes around the features , saying it 's currently a it 's a speech or a nonspeech . phd a : oh , ok . phd c : so there is no frame - dropping till the final features , like , including the deltas are computed . phd a : i see . phd c : and after the deltas are computed , you just pick up the ones that are marked silence and then drop them . phd a : mm - hmm . i see . i see . professor b : so it would be more or less the same thing with the neural net , i guess , actually . phd e : mm - hmm . phd c : so . yeah , that 's what that 's what that 's what , uh , this is doing right now . phd a : i see . ok . professor b : yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : um . ok . so , uh , what 's , uh ? that 's that 's a good set of work that that , uh phd c : just one more thing . like , should we do something f more for the noise estimation , because we still ? professor b : yeah . i was wondering about that . that was i i had written that down there . phd c : yeah . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : um phd e : so , we , uh actually i did the first experiment . this is with just fifteen frames . um . we take the first fifteen frame of each utterance to it , professor b : yeah . phd e : and average their power spectra . um . i tried just plugging the , um , uh , guenter noise estimation on this system , and it uh , it got worse . um , but of course i did n't play with it . professor b : uh - huh . phd e : but mm - hmm . uh , i did n't do much more for noise estimation . i just tried this , professor b : hmm . yeah . well , it 's not surprising it 'd be worse the first time . phd e : and professor b : but , um , phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : it does seem like , you know , i i i i some compromise between always depending on the first fifteen frames and a a always depending on a a pause is is is a good idea . uh , maybe you have to weight the estimate from the first - teen fifteen frames more heavily than than was done in your first attempt . but phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : but phd e : yeah , i guess . professor b : yeah . um . no , i mean um , do you have any way of assessing how well or how poorly the noise estimation is currently doing ? phd e : mmm . no , we do n't . professor b : yeah . phd e : we do n't have nothing that phd c : is there was there any experiment with ? well , i i did the only experiment where i tried was i used the channel zero vad for the noise estimation and frame - dropping . so i do n't have a i do n't have a split , like which one helped more . phd e : yeah . phd c : so . it it was the best result i could get . phd e : mm - hmm . phd c : so , that 's the professor b : so that 's something you could do with , um , this final system . right ? just do this everything that is in this final system except , uh , use the channel zero . phd c : mm - hmm . for the noise estimation . professor b : yeah . phd c : yeah . we can try something . professor b : and then see how much better it gets . phd c : mm - hmm . sure . professor b : if it 's , you know , essentially not better , then it 's probably not worth phd e : yeah . professor b : any more . phd c : yeah . but the guenter 's argument is slightly different . it 's , like , ev even even if i use a channel zero vad , i 'm just averaging the the s power spectrum . but the guenter 's argument is , like , if it is a non - stationary segment , then he does n't update the noise spectrum . so he 's , like he tries to capture only the stationary part in it . so the averaging is , like , different from updating the noise spectrum only during stationary segments . so , th the guenter was arguing that , i mean , even if you have a very good vad , averaging it , like , over the whole thing is not a good idea . professor b : i see ."
