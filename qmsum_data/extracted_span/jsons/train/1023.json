    "query": "<s> what did the team decide to do for the logo to remain visible on the remote ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : we have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we 'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo 's available . user interface : well i sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the r_r_ like that . and that 's at the bottom of it . marketing : yeah . project manager : i think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , user interface : which button ? project manager : i do n't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button , i do n't know , but you know if we 're gon na put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one . are they all gon na have our company logo on them ? every cover ? industrial designer : yeah , i do n't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so i think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea . user interface : i 'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button . industrial designer : it 'll wear off . user interface : what 's the button marketing : yeah , buttons wear off . user interface : well , w w then what 's the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ? i guess . just looking at examples , y you just do n't ever see the logo on a button , it 's always on the actual casing . project manager : right . industrial designer : there 's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual user interface : project manager : on the back ? user interface : but you do n't marketing : but we want it to be seen . project manager : it d visible user interface : but uh , yeah , you do n't see it . project manager : visibility though marketing : we need it to be seen . project manager : 'cause if it was only on the back really the only time you 're gon na see it is when you drop it or when you 're changing the battery . user interface : well , hang on . the other option is , i do n't know if you can see it but it 's like if project manager : i can find it again . user interface : yeah , it 's like the second to last slide . project manager : okay . and yours was called interface concept ? user interface : interface , yeah . project manager : this one ? user interface : yeah . um . project manager : well , for some reason i ca n't get it to just go to that slide directly . user interface : okay , it 's the very right one . you see at the bottom , it 's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it 's like the top . it does n't necessarily replace the entire top . and so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in . project manager : okay , yes user interface : if c you envisioning it ? and so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that 's the bit that changes . project manager : okay . industrial designer : the only problem is we 're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , so i was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . user interface : yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : like a little cut-out kind of industrial designer : yeah . user interface : right . project manager : okay . user interface : that 's like , you know , a a cellphone it 's like the the screen is always just left opened ."
