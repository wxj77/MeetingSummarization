    "query": "<s> what 's their opinion in intervening neath port talbot and erw about addressing the issue of safeguarding their schools ?",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : we have discussed this at length with them . my preference would be for school improvement officers to be employed in the centre , and we continue to have those discussions , but what 's really important to understand is that the regional consortia are not a beast of the government ; they are a beast of the local authorities that have worked together to create a school improvement service that meets their needs . so we ca n't impose that solution , and we continue to discuss with erw what is the optimal way , and they continue to discuss with their constituent local authorities about how that should be organised . hefin david am : are you concerned that neath port talbot have given notice that they want to withdraw from regional working ?"
