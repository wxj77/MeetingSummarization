    "answer": "phd g : um . well , preparation of the french test data actually . so , it means that um , well , it is , uh , a digit french database of microphone speech , downsampled to eight kilohertz and i 've added noise to one part , with the actually the aurora - two noises . and , @ @ so this is a training part . and then the remaining part , i use for testing and with other kind of noises . so we can so this is almost ready . i 'm preparing the the htk baseline for this task . and , yeah . professor f : ok uh , so the htk base lines so this is using mel cepstra and so on , or ? yeah . ok . phd g : yeah . professor f : and again , i guess the p the plan is , uh , to uh then given this what 's the plan again ? phd g : the plan with these data ? professor f : with so so does i just remind me of what what you were going to do with the what what what what 's y you just described what you 've been doing . so if you could remind me of what you 're going to be doing . phd g : yeah . professor f : oh , this is yeah , yeah . phd g : uh , yeah . grad c : tell him about the cube . phd g : well . the cube ? i should tell him about the cube ? grad c : yeah . professor f : oh ! cube . yeah . phd g : yeah . phd e : fill in the cube . phd g : uh we actually we want to , mmm , uh , uh , analyze three dimensions , the feature dimension , the training data dimension , and the test data dimension . um . well , what we want to do is first we have number for each uh task . so we have the um , ti - digit task , the italian task , the french task and the finnish task . professor f : yeah ? phd g : so we have numbers with uh systems i mean i mean neural networks trained on the task data . and then to have systems with neural networks trained on , uh , data from the same language , if possible , with , well , using a more generic database , which is phonetically phonetically balanced , and . um . professor f : so - so we had talked i guess we had talked at one point about maybe , the language id corpus ? phd g : yeah . so . professor f : is that a possibility for that ? phd g : ye - uh yeah , but , uh these corpus , w w there is a callhome and a callfriend also , the callfriend is for language ind identification . well , anyway , these corpus are all telephone speech . so , um . this could be a a problem for why ? because uh , uh , the the speechdat databases are not telephone speech . they are downsampled to eight kilohertz but but they are not uh with telephone bandwidth . professor f : yeah . that 's really funny is n't it ? i mean cuz th this whole thing is for developing new standards for the telephone . grad c : telephone . professor f : yeah . phd g : yeah , but the the idea is to compute the feature before the before sending them to the well , you do n't do not send speech , you send features , computed on th the the device , professor f : mm - hmm . yeah , i know , but the reason phd g : or well . professor f : oh i see , so your point is that it 's it 's it 's uh the features are computed locally , and so they are n't necessarily telephone bandwidth , uh or telephone distortions . phd g : so you yeah . yeah . phd a : did you happen to find out anything about the ogi multilingual database ? professor f : yeah , that 's wh that 's wh that 's what i meant . phd g : yeah , it 's professor f : i said @ @ , there 's there 's there 's an ogi language id , not the not the , uh the callfriend is a is a , uh , ldc w thing , right ? phd g : yea - yeah , there are also two other databases . one they call the multi - language database , and another one is a twenty - two language , something like that . but it 's also telephone speech . phd a : oh , they are ? ok . phd g : uh . well , nnn . professor f : but i 'm not sure phd g : so professor f : i mean , we ' r e e the bandwidth should n't be such an issue right ? because e e this is downsampled and and filtered , right ? so it 's just the fact that it 's not telephone . and there are so many other differences between these different databases . i mean some of this stuff 's recorded in the car , and some of it 's i mean there 's there 's many different acoustic differences . so i 'm not sure if . i mean , unless we 're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the in the training database , i 'm not sure if it 's completely rules it out phd g : yeah . professor f : if our if we if our major goal is to have phonetic context and you figure that there 's gon na be a mismatch in acoustic conditions does it make it much worse f to sort of add another mismatch , if you will . uh , i i i i guess the question is how important is it to for us to get multiple languages uh , in there . phd g : yeah , but mm - hmm . um . yeah . well , actually , for the moment if we w do not want to use these phone databases , we we already have uh english , spanish and french uh , with microphone speech . professor f : mm - hmm . yeah . so that 's what you 're thinking of using is sort of the multi the equivalent of the multiple ? phd g : well . yeah , for the multilingual part we were thinking of using these three databases . professor f : and for the difference in phonetic context that you ? provide that . phd g : well , this uh , actually , these three databases are um generic databases . phd e : yeah . phd g : so w f for for uh italian , which is close to spanish , french and , i i uh , ti - digits we have both uh , digits training data and also more general training data . so . mmm . professor f : well , we also have this broadcast news that we were talking about taking off the disk , which is is microphone data for for english . phd g : yeah . yeah , perhaps yeah , there is also timit . professor f : yeah . phd g : we could use timit . professor f : right . yeah , so there 's plenty of stuff around . ok , so anyway , th the basic plan is to , uh , test this cube . yes . phd g : yeah . phd e : to fill in the cube . professor f : to fill i fill it in , yeah . ok . phd g : yeah , and perhaps , um we were thinking that perhaps the cross - language issue is not , uh , so big of a issue . well , w w we perhaps we should not focus too much on that cross - language stuff . i mean , uh , training training a net on a language and testing a for another language . professor f : uh - huh . but that 's phd g : mmm . perhaps the most important is to have neural networks trained on the target languages . but , uh , with a general database general databases . u so that th well , the the guy who has to develop an application with one language can use the net trained o on that language , or a generic net , professor f : uh , depen it depen it depends how you mean `` using the net `` . phd g : but not trained on a professor f : so , if you 're talking about for producing these discriminative features that we 're talking about you ca n't do that . because because the what they 're asking for is is a feature set . right ? and so , uh , we 're the ones who have been weird by by doing this training . but if we say , `` no , you have to have a different feature set for each language , `` i think this is ver gon na be very bad . phd g : yeah . you think so . grad c : that 's professor f : so oh yeah . yeah . i mean , in principle , i mean conceptually , it 's sort of like they want a re @ @ { comment } well , they want a replacement for mel cepstra . so , we say `` ok , this is the year two thousand , we 've got something much better than mel cepstra . it 's , you know , gobbledy - gook . `` ok ? and so we give them these gobbledy - gook features but these gobbledy - gook features are supposed to be good for any language . cuz you do n't know who 's gon na call , and you know , i mean so it 's it 's it 's , uh , uh how do you know what language it is ? somebody picks up the phone . so thi this is their image . someone picks up the phone , right ? phd g : well , i { comment } chh professor f : and and he he picks up the ph phd g : yeah , but the the application is there is a target language for the application . professor f : yeah . y y y phd g : so , if a professor f : well . but , no but , y you you pick up the phone , phd g : well . professor f : you talk on the phone , phd g : yeah ? professor f : and it sends features out . ok , so the phone does n't know what a what what your language is . phd g : yeah , if yeah . if it 's th in the phone , but professor f : but that 's the image that they have . phd g : well , it that that could be th at the server 's side , professor f : it could be , phd g : and , well . mmm , yeah . professor f : but that 's the image they have , right ? so that 's that 's i mean , one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years . but the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the uh , on the phone . so that 's that 's what we 're involved in . we might might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years , but that 's that 's that 's what they 're asking for . so so i think that th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language . now , it 's the ogi , uh , folks ' perspective right now that probably that 's not the biggest deal . and that the biggest deal is the , um envir acoustic - environment mismatch . and they may very well be right , but i i was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true . if that 's true , we do n't need to worry so much . maybe maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that that that the rest does n't matter . um , the other thing is , uh , this notion of training to uh which i i guess they 're starting to look at up there , { comment } training to something more like articulatory features . uh , and if you have something that 's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across , you know , a wide range of languages . phd g : yeah . professor f : uh , but yeah , so i do n't th i know unfortunately i do n't i see what you 're comi where you 're coming from , i think , but i do n't think we can ignore it . phd g : so we we really have to do test with a real cross - language . i mean , tr for instance training on english and testing on italian , or or we can train or else , uh , can we train a net on , uh , a range of languages and which can include the test the test @ @ the target language , grad c : test on an unseen . phd g : or professor f : yeah , so , um , there 's there 's , uh this is complex . so , ultimately , uh , as i was saying , i think it does n't fit within their image that you switch nets based on language . now , can you include , uh , the the target language ? phd g : yeah . professor f : um , from a purist 's standpoint it 'd be nice not to because then you can say when because surely someone is going to say at some point , `` ok , so you put in the german and the finnish . uh , now , what do you do , uh , when somebody has portuguese ? `` you know ? um , and uh , however , you are n't it is n't actually a constraint in this evaluation . so i would say if it looks like there 's a big difference to put it in , then we 'd make note of it , and then we probably put in the other , because we have so many other problems in trying to get things to work well here that that , you know , it 's not so bad as long as we we note it and say , `` look , we did do this `` . phd a : and so , ideally , what you 'd wan na do is you 'd wan na run it with and without the target language and the training set for a wide range of languages . professor f : uh . yeah . phd g : yeah , perhaps . yeah . phd a : and that way you can say , `` well , `` you know , `` we 're gon na build it for what we think are the most common ones `` , professor f : yeah . phd g : yeah . phd a : but if that somebody uses it with a different language , you know , `` here 's what 's you 're l here 's what 's likely to happen . `` professor f : yeah , cuz the truth is , is that it 's it 's not like there are i mean , al although there are thousands of languages , uh , from uh , uh , the point of view of cellular companies , there are n't . phd a : right . professor f : there 's you know , there 's fifty or something , you know ? so , uh , an and they are n't you know , with the exception of finnish , which i guess it 's pretty different from most most things . uh , it 's it 's , uh most of them are like at least some of the others . and so , our guess that spanish is like italian , and and so on . i guess finnish is a is is a little bit like hungarian , supposedly , right ? phd a : i do n't know anything about finnish . professor f : or is i think well , i kn oh , well i know that h uh , h i mean , i 'm not a linguist , but i guess hungarian and finnish and one of the one of the languages from the former soviet union are in this sort of same family . but they 're just these , you know , uh countries that are pretty far apart from one another , have i guess , people rode in on horses and brought their"
