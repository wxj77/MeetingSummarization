    "answer": "grad b : so the only thing i wan na say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set . there are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that were n't really read . so i wo n't really know until i go through all the transcriber forms and extract out pieces that are in error . so i wa uh . two things . the first is what should we do about digits that were misread ? my opinion is , um , we should just throw them out completely , and have them read again by someone else . you know , the grouping is completely random , phd c : uh - huh . grad b : so it it 's perfectly fine to put a a group together again of errors and have them re - read , just to finish out the test set . postdoc f : oh ! by throw them out completely ? grad b : um , the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said . so those are those are the two options . phd c : yeah . postdoc f : mm - hmm . professor a : but there 's often things where people do false starts . i know i 've done it , where i say say a grad b : what the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction , and they eventually did read the right string , { comment } you extract the right string . phd g : oh , you 're talking about where they completely read the wrong string and did n't correct it ? phd e : yeah . grad b : yeah . and did n't notice . which happens in a few places . phd e : yeah . phd c : yeah . grad b : so so postdoc f : well , and s and you 're talking string - wise , you 're not talking about the entire page ? grad b : correct . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : i get it . grad b : and so the the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said , but then but then the transcript is n't the aurora test set anymore . i do n't think that really matters because the conditions are so different . and that would be a little easier . phd g : well how many are how how often does that happen ? grad b : mmm , five or six times . phd g : oh , so it 's not very much . grad b : no , it 's not much at all . phd g : seems like we should just change the transcripts phd e : yeah . phd g : to match . professor a : yeah , it 's five or six times out of thousands ? phd c : yeah . grad b : four thousand . professor a : four thousand ? phd c : four thous ah ! four thousand . phd g : yeah , it 's professor a : yeah , i would , uh , tak do the easy way , phd g : yeah . professor a : yeah . phd c : yeah . professor a : it it 's kinda nice i mean , wh who knows what studies people will be doing on on speaker - dependent things and so i think having having it all phd c : yeah . professor a : the speakers who we had is is at least interesting . phd g : so you um , how many digits have been transcribed now ? grad b : four thousand lines . and each line is between one and about ten digits . phd g : four thousand lines ? grad b : i did n't i did n't compute the average . i think the average was around four or five . professor a : so that 's a couple hours of of , uh , speech , probably . grad b : yep . yep . professor a : which is a yeah reasonable reasonable test set . phd c : mm - hmm . phd g : mm - hmm . grad b : and , jane , i do have a set of forms which i think you have copies of somewhere . postdoc f : mm - hmm . yeah , true ."
