user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . no that 's okay . no i just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened . ah . uh where was it ? in settings ? okay . alright . thank you . do you guys like your tasks ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i spent a lot of time thinking about what i was gon na do and then a couple of minutes before this i get my function you know the information that i need . user interface : yeah wa wa you actually yeah . but it it 's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation . industrial designer : so frustrating . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so marketing : yeah . i i had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . i have to do that so switch . industrial designer : yeah yeah exactly . this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause i had n't time to intergrate tha the information yet so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : really annoying . project manager : okay . so there we are again . marketing : by your humble p_m_ . project manager : yeah . marketing : project manager : okay this is the agenda . um we have three presentations , i heard . marketing : user interface : really . project manager : yeah really . so who wants to start ? marketing : yeah that 's fine . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : we have to start it right away ? project manager : yeah . uh this is you ? marketing : functional ? yeah functional requirements . project manager : 'kay . marketing : alright . i 'm gon na talk about functional requirements . um well uh some research has be done uh has been done . uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . uh and they also filled in a questionnaire . the findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . they disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . users think they 're ugly . um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . so they they d they do n't match what they want to have on it . um they are often lost somewhere in the room . um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . and they 're bad for r_s_i_ . i do n't know uh how a user can reach that but okay . um there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . um but they are used . i mean the industrial designer : so they do need to be in the project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control . industrial designer : alright . marketing : i mean if you ca n't control the the sound settings i mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that . project manager : often . marketing : so um yeah we have to . industrial designer : by the way my tv does n't have an equ equaliser but marketing : we c we c yeah i mean w we ca n't project manager : next generation does . industrial designer : okay . marketing : my my tv has , industrial designer : no . alright . marketing : but we we can leave them uh away . uh most relevant , uh most used functions , uh they speak for themselves i guess . uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . uh teletext but we can skip that because i saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it 's i should not be used uh any more in the future . project manager : n not used anymore . marketing : so forget this one . user interface : okay . marketing : uh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : by the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? user interface : yeah . i was wondering uh industrial designer : i did n't get anything . marketing : yeah , on on the project uh project manager : yeah . not by mail . i receiv the mail but you do n't . so user interface : but you you 've got more information than uh . marketing : no so it 's a text file n in the project folder . so teletext can be skipped . project manager : that 's in the presentation , so industrial designer : alright . marketing : um there was some research on new features in a remote control . uh about an lcd screen uh and speech recognition . well we got an update for the for the audience . or the the the targeted group . so it 's above forty i guess . project manager : uh below i believe . marketing : the new product ? or below project manager : yeah below forty . marketing : because that 's pretty relevant . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : i thought i read a project manager : our current customers are in the age group forty plus . marketing : yeah ? project manager : and the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . marketing : below ? okay well user interface : but where did you get uh that information ? project manager : that 's in a newsflash . marketing : that 's that 's in the newsfla project manager : user interface : okay . marketing : okay that 's a good to know . um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features . user interface : yeah . marketing : i mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . so i think we can build that in . um yeah well we can skip this part as well , because i thought i read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . um and and also there 's so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . so the physical uh aspect of it . um and i think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control in your room . user interface : yeah . marketing : it 's it 's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . so it 's the people can say , well what 's that , well that 's my remote control , so it 's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh project manager : yeah . but it also needs to have corporate identity . marketing : yeah so the the logo has to be project manager : present and the colours . marketing : uh present yeah , and the colours as well . project manager : so we ca n't change much of that . industrial designer : do we have uh yeah . marketing : yeah so but i i do n't think that 's that 's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it . project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . yeah . yeah . marketing : so i think that 's not gon na gon na affect it very uh very much . project manager : okay . marketing : well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : alright . user interface : okay . project manager : it 's open already so you can use to marketing : . project manager : find yours . user interface : mm . it 's project manager : f_ five . user interface : f_ five . okay . project manager : go jurgen . user interface : oh . what is this ? marketing : user interface : oh no . industrial designer : user interface : how do i uh project manager : you pressed alt f_ four ? user interface : no no no . i pressed the mouse button . project manager : oh great . user interface : industrial designer : it 's th that 's the self-destruct button . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . okay . project manager : uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . user interface : okay . um if you all go stand around uh marketing : yeah . just yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : computer industrial designer : alright . marketing : sure . user interface : um project manager : that 's nice . f_ five . yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : okay . marketing : alright . user interface : i uh had uh two examples . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : this the easy one marketing : yeah . user interface : i think we have to to combine them . and uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . user interface : um but yeah the the age is uh under forty ? project manager : the mm yeah . marketing : yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions . user interface : so we okay so so we have the option for more functions . marketing : so not not too much but yeah . user interface : um yeah . industrial designer : and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech marketing : and the speech recognition yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : alright . user interface : uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids . it 's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options . but marketing : yeah from age of sixteen so yeah . user interface : yeah but i prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . we have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : but if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option . marketing : yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . user interface : okay one device . project manager : yeah . so n it 's very easy . user interface : okay . i did n't see . project manager : now yeah it 's okay . user interface : okay and i also uh yeah . w yeah . marketing : so there are not extra options in this case , but uh project manager : okay . user interface : we have to make it fashionable . like you uh said uh before . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : uh yeah the basic functions . um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed . project manager : yeah so maybe you can hide them or something . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . project manager : yeah you make a screen menu or something . marketing : and the and the yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and then the basic function just on the device itself . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu . project manager : yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen . user interface : yeah . project manager : what does the screen do ? user interface : did i uh industrial designer : alright . marketing : uh . what are wh project manager : yeah . it 's low power . user interface : did i break it ? marketing : what . project manager : so what does the screen do ? they said they needed it but what does it do ? what do they want with the screen ? user interface : for for the advanced functions i think . project manager : yeah that 's what we make it up . marketing : yeah well it yeah it did n't project manager : so but what did the marketing marketing : it did n't say what they want to do with the screen . well i , my guess is it 's it 's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions . project manager : yeah okay it 's handy . with no predefined uh user interface : like searching for channels and industrial designer : ah look . marketing : yeah searching for channels , programming them . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we have your uh oh never mind . project manager : we 're back online . user interface : okay . that 's uh i 'm al i 'm almost finished so project manager : okay . user interface : um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . so we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable project manager : mm-hmm . content and form . user interface : yeah content and form . industrial designer : . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : now that that was uh was the end . project manager : that was the end . okay . industrial designer : okay . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : well my presentation is a bit uh sucky . marketing : well you can improvise right ? project manager : uh which one is it ? technical functions ? industrial designer : yeah a little bit . project manager : this one ? industrial designer : uh no . no no . project manager : functional requirements ? industrial designer : yeah i think that would be it then . user interface : project manager : you did n't put it in ? or industrial designer : i have no idea . marketing : so we we can go for industrial designer : that w . project manager : it 's not really english . industrial designer : let me check . i know . project manager : uh kick off . oh working design i got it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it . project manager : here you go . industrial designer : alright how do i uh skip pages ? project manager : just uh press uh yeah . yeah . industrial designer : the keys yeah ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : alright . um yeah well i was working on this before i got my information . so i was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : industrial designer : and well the info on the website which came too late . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um so i did n't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . those were my uh starting points . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh i was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and i was supposed to do it like this . but um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that i had to follow , so i was trying to organise them for myself . project manager : marketing : industrial designer : and then make the project manager : design yeah . industrial designer : the design , a the actual design , marketing : design ? yeah . industrial designer : but i never came around to do that . so i 'm not really sure what i 'm supposed to say about it . marketing : okay . industrial designer : i mean everything speaks for itself i guess . mean you press a button um the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah frequency . yeah . industrial designer : and uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . and then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the tv project manager : yeah decoder . industrial designer : and the tv will translate it into a function . um yeah well this was actually all i got around to do . project manager : blank . yeah okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i mean i dunno if i 'm too slow for this stuff , but uh project manager : work harder ."
