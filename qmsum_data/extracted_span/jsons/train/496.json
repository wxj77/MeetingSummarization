    "answer": "user interface : yeah . marketing : can you like i mean this may be too complicated , but , i wish i had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , but the rest of them like went in . user interface : the remote marketing : do you know what i 'm saying ? project manager : kind of pull out of the side . user interface : there are remote controls like that , yeah . like some tvs they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons . so if you wan na do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and there 's all the all the special buttons . marketing : 'cause then 's like people who do n't wan na ever look at them , never even have to see them project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just do n't even read it then you 'll never even know that those things can pull out . user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and you 're a happy person and everyone else does n't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , that 's a good idea . user interface : yeah . marketing : more complicated ones , user interface : i think that 's a good idea , yeah . marketing : but 's all still in one . project manager : um we have to be careful that that that does n't impede um the chip transmitting information , but um that 's gon na be mostly technological thing . um . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : good point . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay um , so what are we emphasising ? i what in this project ? user interface : si simplicity and fashion . project manager : simplicity and fashion . marketing : i think simplicity , fashion . industrial designer : yeah mm . project manager : okay , those are very good goals , i think , um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do . simplicity and fashion and , yeah , or usability speci however you wan na say that , which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you do n't have to travel around a lot . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . marketing : what can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ? i 'm just wondering . project manager : i think it 's a lot to do with battery , but that 's just my marketing : okay . industrial designer : the battery and that i think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so 's just the quality of the chip . industrial designer : yeah . i think so . marketing : okay . industrial designer : the quality uh quality of all the components really , i mean , we ca n't really do anything shoddy work , 'cause it 's user interface : yeah . industrial designer : gon na be visible down the line . project manager : so our target group , we 're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? marketing : well , i dunno how useful that number is if we 're not doing project manager : s voice recognition , which i kind of i kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control , marketing : yeah . yeah . i do n't . project manager : like it might be necessary for a tv but not for the remote c , you know . user interface : it 's , yeah , it 's pretty it 's pretty high-tech . industrial designer : mm-mm . project manager : seems a little bit mm-hmm . yeah , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and it might be too expensive . marketing : and if the whole idea is you 're using a remote then why would you have voice , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : like you know what i mean and then it 's like you would n't need a remote you 'd just talk to your tv . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : ooh . user interface : it 's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , project manager : user interface : who ca n't even be bothered to pick up the remote . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm yeah . maybe i mean if i get m more numbers , i 'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . but this does n't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : which is n't , i mean , really is n't that representative , especially if it 's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there 's very few in each age group , so industrial designer : yeah , but i th i think regardless we 're we 're aiming for the under sixty five or something . project manager : under sixty five , okay , that 's a good start . um . i 'd say we 're uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ? 'cause that would go up to like fifty ? industrial designer : or like single professionals or something . project manager : okay , single marketing : twenty to like fifty five . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i dunno . project manager : it 's it 's hard to narrow it down . industrial designer : it 's really hard to figure out right now . user interface : i think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : i mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it 's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , project manager : okay . user interface : and that might be older people , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : but then we 've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : well maybe we do n't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , project manager : right . marketing : maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that , user interface : yeah . yeah aim for a an income group . industrial designer : that 's a good point . marketing : like , well project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . marketing : obviously it has to be someone who owns a television , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing . project manager : so maybe it 's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is industrial designer : yeah , t probably . user interface : yeah . project manager : because , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people , but okay . um oh , there 're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it 's lost ? like a button on a tv you can press marketing : yeah . project manager : and it 'll ring or something , i do n't know like or beep ? marketing : h i mean , like i said before , fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . marketing : and if we 're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it would n't be like a random thing to sort of add in . it would be relevant to like the overall goal i think , industrial designer : yeah , that 'll probably be good . marketing : so project manager : okay , we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions . so let 's do that quickly . um so we want something to keep it from getting lost . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and we want um we want large buttons for the essential things . large , accessible buttons for the essentials . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : we want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . marketing : user interface : which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they 're uh they 're not as prominent as the main features . project manager : mm-hmm . um , yeah , hidden way . and we also want it to be fashionable , which i 'm not sure if that 's a function so much as a um yeah marketing : on your coffee table , it 's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . alright . project manager : okay , do it . any other essential functions that we need ? battery ? do we need a long-life battery ? industrial designer : battery battery use . yeah , but i think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really . marketing : yeah . project manager : but we might as well . marketing : so you never have to change the battery . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : we should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . i suspect the remote control does need a battery , project manager : yeah , i would imagine . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but i dunno if you can project manager : just 'cause it is an electronic device , the user interface : yeah . industrial designer : it i think it does . i do n't i do n't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one . user interface : yeah , without the energy , yeah . industrial designer : but you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your ipod . user interface : yeah , that 's that 's possible . yeah . industrial designer : you could we could maybe do that instead . project manager : charging . industrial designer : so you do n't ha you got like a rechargeable battery . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place . project manager : mm-hmm . we have to think about um space in living-rooms , too , like 'cause they 're i mean , would you put it on top of the tv ? i do n't know , just think okay , that 's that 's a good idea , we 'll keep it . think it 's industrial designer : yeah . that 's just off the top of my head . project manager : and maybe fun . okay . um 'kay we 're gon na conclude now , has everyone said their functions and 'kay . um after the meeting we 're gon na each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary . i do n't know what summarisation . um and then we 'll have our lunch break . after that we have thirty minutes of individual work . um i 'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these powerpoint slides . if everyone could do that as well , that 'd be great . um you each have individual actions , i_ um i_d_ industrial design you 've your components concept , user interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching . marketing : project manager : and as as per last time you 'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . and hopefully , i hope , next time you 'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could . it 's kinda frustrating , industrial designer : yeah , who knows . project manager : but um be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary . mm 'kay ? industrial designer : sounds good . project manager : great seeing y'all . marketing : it 's good . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : did you um were you able to like put yours in the group folder ? industrial designer : yes , i just did that . marketing : okay . industrial designer : hopefully it is there for people . yeah ? project manager : looks like there are um looks like there 's a second one kind of of mine that 's that i did n't do , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it 's from like an earlier project , i think so um industrial designer : okay . marketing : where is that ? yours is project manager : under the shared folder , i do n't know it might not even be under yours as well . industrial designer : technical . so project manager : projects . industrial designer : in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements . at least that 's what i have in . marketing : i only have three , i just have like our three . yeah . industrial designer : yeah , that 's what i have as well , r rose project manager : okay . you do n't have mine ? marketing : no , but that 's 'cause i think yours is in the e-mail separate , like it 's not on the server . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but if i open it and then save it , probably will be there . oh wait , never mind you ca n't save it to the project manager : okay . well i 'll figure that out in the meantime . industrial designer : okay ."
