    "query": "<s> what did cathy mcleod think of the forestry industry when talking about the uncertainty of canadian economy and what the government should do during the special period ?",
    "answer": "mrs. cathy mcleod : other governments have managed to provide updates for their citizens and carry out their responsibilities , but of course this government has sidelined parliament with simply a question-but-no-answer period . let 's try something else . the forestry industry was in crisis even before the pandemic , with mills closing down and thousands of jobs lost . eight weeks ago , minister freeland said , i have had many discussions with leaders in our forestry sector and the provinces about what we can do to support the industry today . meanwhile , we 've had support going to the arts and we 've had support going to fisheries , just to name a few , but arguably for the industry that was having some of the most numerous challenges , it has been radio silence . that was eight weeks ago today . can the government at least commit to releasing an updated softwood lumber transition plan before we rise ? hon . seamus o'regan ( minister of natural resources ) : mr . chair , we remain committed , of course , to the forestry industry and seeing it through this pandemic and this very uncertain time . the expanding market opportunities program , for instance , has helped canada 's forestry sector diversify , create jobs and open new markets . we 've had new construction projects that are active today , using canadian wood in key markets like korea , japan , china and the united states . tomorrow this house will vote on our government 's investment of $ 20.97 million for this program . it 's part of our budget 2019 commitment to invest $ 251 million over three years , and i hope the opposition will support us in that . mrs. cathy mcleod : it was stated in a major newspaper this morning that this government is like a sexy sports carvroom , vroom , vroombut with a history of breakdowns and major repairs . i think that might describe what has been happening . for forestry , it has been eight weeks and there has been nothing . there is another area that deputy prime minister freeland did talk about . we were talking about the u.s. softwood lumber duties that are being held in the united states . it 's billions of dollars being held with the u.s. treasury . in april , she acknowledged that these duties are a real issue for the softwood lumber industry . what 's been done since that time ?"
