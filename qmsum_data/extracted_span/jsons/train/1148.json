    "answer": "project manager : um we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . so switching over i 've just left uh my first two screens . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : um mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . user interface : okay . cool . project manager : um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? n user interface : mm um . no , i do n't think so . project manager : no ? okay , cool . then we shall start with a presentation from raj . marketing : yeah . hi , me raj , again . uh in this meeting i i 'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology . the met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way we have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . so what are our findings ? in our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . so this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . so we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . so this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls . user interface : the last one is the most important one , is it ? marketing : no the first one is the user interface : oh , sorry . marketing : uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , user interface : okay . marketing : the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . user interface : okay . marketing : the second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . so it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . project manager : marketing : so that indicates our technological advancement . and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : like it should n't be too much co complicated , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : there should n't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , it should n't be too complicated uh like this way . and it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . so that they could know how to use these remote controls . when we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that user interface : sorry . industrial designer : marketing : ah yeah ? user interface : i was just reading fruit and vegetables . project manager : user interface : hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . marketing : y yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , user interface : marketing : because the g world is now changing it 's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , user interface : okay . yeah . industrial designer : we should make a big sponge lemon , marketing : becoming industrial designer : and then it 'd be it would be yellow . marketing : yeah . project manager : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : it 's marketing : so user interface : th that 's very good . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . so something like that we we should do . user interface : glow-in-the-dark . okay . marketing : and people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . industrial designer : mm . user interface : well , that 's good . marketing : yeah . yeah . user interface : that 's what we kind of predicted anyway . marketing : so so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . so that should also be taken into consideration . user interface : okay . okay . marketing : so these are my views . user interface : okay . marketing : so user interface : okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can marketing : no it ca y a user interface : do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? marketing : the rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co user interface : okay . quite disposable . marketing : yeah . 'cause we it should n't be have any harm to the environment also , user interface : okay . marketing : because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , project manager : alright , okay . user interface : oh okay . marketing : so we do n't want to have any harm to the society , user interface : uh-huh . okay . marketing : so project manager : fashion . user interface : project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : cool . marketing : so that 's all . project manager : fruit and veg , well there you go . user interface : project manager : just what i think of when i think of a remote control . user interface : a remote control ? yeah . marketing : user interface : and were there any factors that were n't important in the survey , that they said we do n't want ? marketing : s uh we did n't find out any such point . user interface : or was it just okay . marketing : uh yes , there could be , but we could n't find out any , so project manager : mm-mm-mm-mm . user interface : cool . project manager : mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . user interface : f_ , what is it ? um . project manager : function f_ eight . user interface : yeah . okay . marketing : yeah . oh no , . user interface : no signal . is that ? industrial designer : no , it 's got it 's got it . marketing : yeah , uh yeah , uh yeah . yeah . project manager : excuse me . user interface : okay , and then f_ five , right ? project manager : uh , yeah . user interface : okay . um okay , so the interface concept um . yeah . the interface specification , what people um how they interact with it basically , i think . um so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what 's good about them , what 's bad about them , um i looked at their flaws , so we 're going to look at their flaws , everything . um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : uh the findings , i 've got some pictures to show you as well . project manager : either . industrial designer : user interface : yeah . okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . project manager : uh okay . user interface : um and we also found that there 's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . so i think for our remote control there is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but i think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , project manager : right , okay . yeah . user interface : i think , people find that important , 'cause then it 's easy to use . project manager : user interface : and we 've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . project manager : excellent . user interface : do i press escape f_ five ? or just project manager : uh no just escape should uh user interface : escape , okay . um , oh i still have n't got my glasses on . yeah , okay . so these are the some of the pictures of existing ones . project manager : user interface : i 'll just walk you through them . this one is a voice recognition . project manager : 'kay . user interface : and that 's the kind of idea we 're going for . project manager : looks pretty complicated . user interface : there 's um an lcd thing , which we thought could i thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . project manager : right , okay . user interface : this one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , project manager : mm-hmm , like the middle button . user interface : which yeah . project manager : okay . user interface : um and but i 'm not exactly sure how you 'd use that , industrial designer : project manager : ah it 's kinda like scrolling user interface : like would the computer come project manager : uh right , well , if i s if i 'm thinking of the right one , i 've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . user interface : uh-huh , that 's like the lcd one , project manager : right , okay . user interface : is it ? but the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . but i presume that the functions must come up on the tv screen . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , presumably . user interface : i think that 's what that is . so these are just a few ideas . again that 's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , i think on that one . industrial designer : uh it looks threatening . project manager : yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . user interface : yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . industrial designer : it looks like yeah . user interface : um this one i thought was really cool . it 's w it 's got the programmability function that we talked about . industrial designer : user interface : you can put it in there , it 's for your kids , and it 's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . project manager : okay . user interface : and that 's really easy to use , bright , so i like this one lot for our design . i think something like that would be good . project manager : yeah , i m i mean the one thing i think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , i 've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . user interface : of course yellow . project manager : so like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . user interface : right , yeah . yeah , that 's true . yeah . um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the tv or something . and this one , the over-sized one , i do n't know about you , but i think it 's a bit too gimmicky . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : i do n't think that will sell very well . project manager : i mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? user interface : i guess so . i do n't know . industrial designer : then d blind do n't watch tv . project manager : strange . user interface : i think that 's a bit yeah exactly . project manager : no they do , they do . industrial designer : they do ? project manager : they listen to it . yeah . user interface : yeah . and um this one is just pointing out . i like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . project manager : right , okay . user interface : so that could that 's a bit confusing . um but the buttons on this i think are it 's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . they do n't have to be all the same . so that 's quite cool . um . project manager : 'kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , do n't they ? user interface : yeah , exactly . um f_ five . yes . so there are some of the findings . so we need to combine those ones um industrial designer : user interface : and i 've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . project manager : brilliant . that 's handy . user interface : um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . um so i think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . project manager : okay . user interface : it 's you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that 's and it 's much yeah . so that 's quite cool . uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols i thought were good , the lcd , it does look smart , but i think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the industrial designer : the lcd user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and the other stuff uh , i think . user interface : and the speech recognition , 'cause i think we 're definitely going for the speech recognition , marketing : but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , user interface : are we ? marketing : but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . user interface : uh-huh . project manager : okay . marketing : uh yeah . user interface : uh-huh . but our budget , we 've project manager : it 's still it 's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , i think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . user interface : uh-huh . okay . project manager : okay . user interface : i 'm not sure if the if for twenty five euros uh per uh twelve euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . industrial designer : ben bana project manager : yeah . i ca n't see tha although , th i mean to be to be sure they have got i mean they are going crazy with the lcd technology now , user interface : the lcd . project manager : so that you 've got your lcd tvs and everything so maybe the small industrial designer : project manager : but i mean like i i the black and white , i guess , it just does n't look funky enough . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : um but , i mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour lcd screens , w i ju i mean user interface : yeah . s project manager : i would n't know about the costs of them . user interface : uh-huh . industrial designer : but uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gon na be too much just overload ? marketing : and the project manager : twelve fifty . marketing : uh i it will be easy because there will be , on lcd s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa project manager : possibly . user interface : yeah , that 's the thing , because industrial designer : but but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? you 're looking at the tv project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and and it 's uh project manager : yeah . user interface : that 's true , yeah . industrial designer : it just seems kind of like a a needless th user interface : and one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so i think i 'm not sure about the lcd . project manager : right . user interface : it 's a it 's great , it 's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we 're trying to go for eas easy to use , it 's not the thing we should go for , i think . child-friendly , i thought this was good , as you pointed out the um the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it 's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , i think . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so which vegetable ? project manager : well i mean we could make a user interface : yeah , i know , carrot . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . project manager : well , si since we 're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , i think your lemon was n't that far s industrial designer : the the lemon . well what are the options ? user interface : yeah . project manager : and if it does n't work you know , we 've just made a lemon . user interface : but we do n't want it to be yeah . um the child-friendly , yeah . easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . i like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . project manager : mm-hmm . i like i like the colourful buttons as well . user interface : i think that 's a good idea to go for . yeah . and the mouse one , i thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . um . project manager : yeah . i mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , user interface : yeah . project manager : so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use . user interface : s yeah . so they 'd be able to use that um , as i said i think i i 'd presume it would come up on the screen . project manager : yeah . user interface : um so there you go . project manager : and that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the tv maker , so user interface : yeah . so that 's um the user interface project manager : 'kay . user interface : design . project manager : industrial designer : okay . user interface : so okay , i 'll take this out now then . project manager : user interface : there you go . industrial designer : i guess there are a lot of options that we 're gon na have to choose from among , project manager : yeah , looks like it . industrial designer : and i 'll i 'll give you the uh , i guess , technical considerations for those . project manager : uh industrial designer : and i 'm gon na use the whiteboard , just 'cause we have n't used it . project manager : yeah , i was just thinking the self same thing . user interface : industrial designer : right . so , the way i 'm gon na do this is uh we 're gon na take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , project manager : industrial designer : and then we 'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget . project manager : magic man . industrial designer : so uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . um this is what they sent me . 'kay . here 's uh the competition , i suppose . project manager : industrial designer : um you open it up , there 's a circuit board inside , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um and there 's a a chip , a processor , the t_a_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch project manager : so this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? industrial designer : right , it 's very they 're very cheap remote . this remote costs nothing , you know . um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the l_e_d_ light , which i can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . project manager : right . industrial designer : oh here it is . um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the uh project manager : okay . so can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? industrial designer : r um no , i mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . project manager : they got ta be almost a key-ring . industrial designer : right . so this is what we need to have for certain . project manager : okay . industrial designer : um . so you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what 's it gon na be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we 'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail i got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . so lots of choices , user interface : project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : what do we think ? uh or sponge , i guess , is n't on there , right . project manager : well . user interface : mm . i 'm not sure about the sponge . industrial designer : organic sponge . project manager : well , i mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , does n't it . industrial designer : uh yeah , it 's very elasticy for sure . project manager : um yeah . and that would k also give it kinda durability user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : and ther that 's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . industrial designer : yeah so project manager : um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? industrial designer : okay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex user interface : i like the rubber , the stress balls , i think , project manager : oh right , okay . user interface : you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it 's good to hold and industrial designer : oh right . project manager : i do n't know what that stuff is . industrial designer : so something with give to it . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . and user interface : and that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . industrial designer : and the colour is yellow , right ? user interface : yeah , project manager : or at least incorporating , yeah . user interface : y yellow incorporated , yeah . industrial designer : yellow , okay . um . project manager : i mean i forgot i we 're sort of uh i do n't know what other standard silver kind of user interface : i think project manager : other parts or uh user interface : mm . yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there 's gon na be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm ' kay . user interface : or i if we 're having buttons actually , industrial designer : so yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ? project manager : um i quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so multi-coloured buttons . user interface : you do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . project manager : yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it does n't look too childish , perhaps . user interface : makes it easy to use . yeah , that 's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . industrial designer : okay . project manager : yeah . although i mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . i mean if we are gon na make it a novel i mean double-curved sounds good to me if we 're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , industrial designer : okay . user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . yeah . project manager : a bit comfier , you know . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : mm 'kay so the shape we wan na go um how exactly ? maybe double user interface : like uh an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you 're thinking of , project manager : yeah it 's uh , yeah , that that 'd be that 's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you do n't drop it . user interface : or just like a it 's not industrial designer : what about a banana ? user interface : yeah . project manager : user interface : we could make novelty remote controls . industrial designer : yeah ? okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , project manager : well , yeah , i mean like industrial designer : 'cause it 's yellow fruit , user interface : industrial designer : right ? project manager : yeah , yeah . mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . yeah . user interface : yeah . but then how would you point it ? marketing : yeah . mm-hmm . user interface : how would you point it ? industrial designer : oh i it does n't matter which end you point , i guess . user interface : what industrial designer : we could have a little l_e_d_s on each end . marketing : yeah , i appreciate this idea , project manager : they only cost pennies . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : because then this this will help us in our advertisement also project manager : marketing : and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people 's choices . that what our data shows that , so this w this w user interface : yeah . y i 'm i 'm not sure about the banana idea . marketing : project manager : um . industrial designer : so a spongy banana re marketing : project manager : i mean that that th user interface : rubber banana . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : okay . project manager : it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay , okay . user interface : i think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . and what else did you say about fashions ? what was trendy ? marketing : uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , project manager : s industrial designer : see marketing : like people uh now project manager : and sponginess . industrial designer : so maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable user interface : and spongy , yeah . marketing : spongy . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : like so it would have a stem perhaps user interface : yeah . maybe , yeah . industrial designer : maybe a it 'd be s axially symmetric . user interface : like what 's what 's that , i do n't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it 's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . i do n't know the name of that . industrial designer : so it 'd look like this kinda . user interface : yeah , that 's what i was thinking . industrial designer : like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? user interface : yeah , maybe that 's what they are . 'cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit industrial designer : yeah , user interface : and industrial designer : and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , why the hell not . let 's that 'll make us fifty million euros . user interface : i do n't know . what do you guy what do you think ? industrial designer : project manager : um . well , i guess it 's kind of dra uh you do n't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , then only we can relate it with something . project manager : yeah , we can relate it by advertising or marketing : yeah . exactly . industrial designer : okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? project manager : yeah . marketing : or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . user interface : uh-huh . industrial designer : okay . project manager : there 's a good man . there 's a good idea . user interface : okay . industrial designer : okay um , i guess , since you 're the marketing guy . marketing : yeah , sure . i will be happy to do that . project manager : industrial designer : we 'll uh okay , we could do that . um . user interface : okay . and buttons would , did we say ? uh different shapes of buttons ? project manager : um i l i su i mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . industrial designer : okay , so project manager : they 've got , i mean , they 've got standard sort of intuitive um industrial designer : so buttons . project manager : things that are always used . industrial designer : okay , just like that . user interface : project manager : that 's cool . user interface : yeah . project manager : i like it . industrial designer : okay . project manager : um . industrial designer : with the scroll-wheel or no ? user interface : yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? project manager : uh speech recognition , i think , so we need a microphone presumably . industrial designer : okay uh i could put the microphone here . project manager : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay there 's the microphone . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : where should i put the microphone ? project manager : i mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? user interface : yeah , i 'm not sure . um i mean those ideas i saw were just for inspiration , i think . project manager : glad , we 're not doing this for real . user interface : um yeah , i can no i 'm not sure . industrial designer : okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? user interface : i couldn yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . project manager : and uh i think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone industrial designer : okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or project manager : i would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it 's yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : 'kay there 's the mic . project manager : so it can be sort of held and w user interface : that 's cool . industrial designer : project manager : we really need really gon na need to hold it , if it 's gon na be voice recognition . industrial designer : um n well we can whoops . project manager : oops . user interface : so let 's not use the whiteboard any more . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : marketing : industrial designer : um . marketing : project manager : upsidaisy . industrial designer : oops , sorry . okay . user interface : and uh so what else was there ? um the industrial designer : project manager : user interface : what about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? project manager : i s i still like it . user interface : are we just gon na leave that ? project manager : um but that 's me . user interface : you still like it . 'cause we 've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . industrial designer : right . project manager : yes , or maybe it 's just going a bit uh too far . i mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . user interface : 'cause um it could yeah . project manager : um do n't wan na sort of overkill . user interface : especially with yellow . mm . i dunno . project manager : 'cause i mean like uh if we i mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it 's a fruit ? user interface : then you put it in the fruit bowl ? industrial designer : they can work from a project manager : yeah , you know , and then you just tal industrial designer : you do n't have to hold it . project manager : i mean like everybody 's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : i it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , project manager : um . industrial designer : you know they have uh fruits all round them . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . make them make them think of fruit , yeah . industrial designer : now just make sure they do n't eat the remote . marketing : yeah . project manager : i mean uh some uh i user interface : yeah , do we need buttons ? project manager : l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , i dunno , an apple . then it 's just apple so sort of industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh , yellow apples though hmm . user interface : i quite like the shape . i quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it 's quite got a quite steady base . project manager : yeah . okay , yeah , that 's good . industrial designer : okay . but yeah project manager : groovy . user interface : and as we say we n we do n't wan na be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . project manager : yeah , . industrial designer : but yeah , about the speech thing , it does n't have to be hand held or close . it can sit at a distance and pick it up still . project manager : yeah . so i mean like you could actually user interface : okay . marketing : or we can project manager : yeah , gives you the options . marketing : we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so a selection of casings . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : it will look l uh yeah . in that w project manager : it kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um user interface : yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , marketing : s s sorry ? user interface : did n't you ? you said about disposable earli people want disposable things marketing : uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , user interface : so we could do that , like have a choice . yeah . marketing : okay ? if somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . project manager : like like mobiles , yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : if somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . it will give apple shape look . so in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , user interface : okay . okay . marketing : without uh yeah . user interface : we still need the buttons in the same places thought , marketing : yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . user interface : do n't we ? project manager : you can standardise those , i mean . marketing : yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , user interface : oh , that 's the other side . oh , okay . marketing : so half of that will be look the user interface : oh , half a fruit . oh , okay , okay . marketing : yeah , not not the upper side . so from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . user interface : okay , okay . marketing : so in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . industrial designer : yeah yeah . marketing : and project manager : i think tho i think if you 're gon na have a facia then you 'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , user interface : okay . project manager : 'cause when if you think about it if they 're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they 're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . it does n't really user interface : mm mm . project manager : you know 'cause that 'd be in the palm of their hand and they would n't be able to see it , user interface : yeah . project manager : unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . and you 've got the facia , and you can just talk at the user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : maybe . industrial designer : okay , um so marketing : project manager : so you 've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . industrial designer : yeah , marketing : industrial designer : s i guess we decided on material , right ? so that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and the colours we got down , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and the shape , maybe we 'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . well , um because well , i i 'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because i think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what project manager : okay , so we stick with what we 've got there . user interface : yeah , w i think wh wha would we 're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . they wanted something that looks fancy and i think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : because al already we 're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : i mean we could make it nice pale yellow . project manager : well , it 's kind of got ta be our company 's yellow . user interface : okay . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so again i mean like we could have , uh i mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different user interface : okay . yeah . project manager : colour , but have user interface : maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . project manager : kinda going round , yeah . um i mean e even if user interface : because project manager : i mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . user interface : yeah . project manager : so you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . user interface : yeah . yeah . uh-huh . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : w sort of industrial designer : great . um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we do n't have to be limited by that . we can use a hand-dynamo . um i do n't know what that means , we crank it ? project manager : uh it 's i think it 's basically the more you move i it , it 's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . industrial designer : right , it 's like those watches that you c project manager : uh yeah . industrial designer : so , this might be an idea for something that people really wan na grab , you can shake it if it 's out of power . user interface : oh , a d a dynamo ? marketing : yeah , . project manager : yeah , i like that , yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah that 's quite cool . industrial designer : okay . so if it if it 's not working , i guess people 's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . marketing : but project manager : okay . you shake it and scream at it . marketing : but but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , it is , yeah . marketing : because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat project manager : it does leave them with an obligation to marketing : yeah , to mo yeah . project manager : especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . marketing : yeah , industrial designer : right . marketing : because most of the people project manager : then if it 's just sitting on the user interface : yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , okay . industrial designer : okay . user interface : that 's true . project manager : right um what are the other options ? industrial designer : uh there 's solar power . um . marketing : uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : and the days when there is no sola sunlight project manager : i 'm i 'm with uh raj on that , industrial designer : okay , so probably just marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : i think , you know , marketing : what we w project manager : i 've got i 've got no i 've got a north facing house , there 's not really ever sun coming in my window . marketing : yeah . i think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . user interface : but w like just normal light ? project manager : oh that 's true . marketing : they can they can recharge it . project manager : i mean i w i w uh user interface : project manager : that idea that i thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a , user interface : and we 're a very environmentally friendly company , are n't we as well ? project manager : yeah , marketing : yeah . project manager : having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : 'kay . user interface : like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing . marketing : yeah , that 's yeah , exactly . project manager : yeah that kind of thing . industrial designer : okay . so uh a rechargeable battery . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . um the user interface , the buttons , i guess we talked about this already . project manager : rechargeable . . what 's chip on print ? what 's sorry , never mind . industrial designer : uh th the uh the electronics um , basically the more features we add um oops , this one . so the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : which adds to the cost as you can expect . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um . but uh i think we can keep it all under budget . so uh yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so just in time . project manager : yeah , and if we if we 're just having buttons and the speech then we 're getting our cheapest option of chipping . user interface : just in time . industrial designer : right , right . project manager : that 's good . industrial designer : yeah , project manager : uh woah . industrial designer : and keeping the lcd screen out . project manager : okay , we 're we 're kind of uh we 're kind of um excuse m i 've just deleted that whole thing . um we 're kind of running out of time , so if you could uh . was that you ?
