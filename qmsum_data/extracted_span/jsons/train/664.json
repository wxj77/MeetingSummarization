    "answer": "professor b : um . yeah . grad f : so . i do n't expect anyone to . but . professor b : um . so , w what follows ? at some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? grad f : no . we had spoken w about this before professor b : yeah , but i 've forgotten . grad f : and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once . and the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity . so as long as we do that , we 're covered . professor b : and how long of an opportunity did you tell them ? phd e : well , then grad f : i do n't think so . phd e : it we 're hoping that does n't happen , but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail grad f : that will happen . phd e : or phd h : that will happen . phd e : right . grad f : that will absolutely happen . because people do n't read their email , or they 'll read and say `` i do n't care about that , i 'm not gon na delete anything `` and they don just wo n't reply to it . phd h : maybe uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? grad f : no . we have what they put on the speaker form , postdoc a : well { comment } most grad f : which was just generic contact information . postdoc a : but the ones that we 're dealing with now are all local , phd h : well , then postdoc a : except the ones who i mean , we we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups . phd h : mmm . ok . postdoc a : so maybe , uh , i you know , that 's not that many people and if i if , uh i i there is an advantage to having them admit and if i can help with with processing that , i will . it 's it 's there is an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating grad f : yeah . i mean i thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago . postdoc a : yes , we did . grad f : and so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again ."
