    "query": "<s> how did the deputy minister speak to her amendments in group 2 that relate to the duty to report on the effect of the legislation ?",
    "answer": "julie morgan am : thank you , chair . the amendments in this group are to do with the post-implementation review of the bill , and i believe there was also a committee recommendation to this end from your committee , so you strongly influenced this amendment . it 's clear from members ' contributions to this group and recommendations by the committee at stage 1 that they share my commitment to the importance of post-implementation review of the effect of the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment . i 've already provided assurance that i agree with the importance placed on such a review , both in the explanatory memorandum and during stage 1 scrutiny . i also made a commitment to bring forward a government amendment to put a duty to undertake a post-implementation review on the face of the bill . i have done this with amendment 2 . amendment 5 sets out that this provision will come into force the day after royal assent . as i said in my responses to the stage 1 committee report , and as set out in the explanatory memorandum , the post-implementation review of this bill will not be a single piece of work , but a continuous programme of work during the years following the commencement of section 1 . firstly , we will continue to conduct attitudinal surveys , which will be used to track changes in attitude towards the physical punishment of children and prevalence of parents reporting that they use physical punishment . the surveys will also be used to monitor the effectiveness of our awareness-raising campaign . secondly , through a dedicated task and finish group , we are working with organisations to put in place arrangements to establish robust methods for capturing meaningful data relating to the bill and to consider the possible impact on services . turning to amendment 2c , this amendment would require welsh ministers to prepare and lay before the assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 is commenced . this amendment is unnecessary and is in conflict with what i think is a priority for the implementation of this bill : that is , given certainty on the commencement date and in enabling us to work towards this with our partners and stakeholders . i also think this amendment is not required because , as i 've already stated , we are preparing to assess the effectiveness of our awareness raising . in june , i shared the findings of a representative survey , which establishes a baseline on public awareness and opinion towards physical punishment of children and the proposed legislation . i shared this with the committee . right , thank you . well , just to go on to cover some of the points that have been raised , on the issue of training now , i think janet raised a number of points about training , and we do have an operations , procedures , processes and training task and finish group as part of our implementation work , and they are considering guidance and training requirements . there are many professional bodies represented on that group , many of whom i think have given evidence here today , and they 've really got a chance to have their say . the officials are also looking at training as part of the revision of the explanatory memorandum at stage 3 , so there will be more information about training there . but we have this group looking at it , and it is very key . generally , i think that all the contributions are very helpful , and i know they 're meant in the spirit of trying to improve the legislation . i ca n't support amendments 2a , 2c , and amendments 2e to 2k , because these amendments make little difference in terms of practical effect to what we have in the bill already , or they 're covered by the government amendments that i 've moved . but i do hope the committee is reassured that we are committed to undertaking a very thorough , multifaceted review of the impact of the legislation that includes tracking public attitudes and considering impacts on public services . now , tracking the public attitudes will be going along at regular points , so there 's no question there of having to wait ; we 'll be having regular reporting of public attitudes ."
