    "answer": "user interface : i had what i just uh i should again . i miss a few buttons , but . well . at least uh what we should also have on , i just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh if if you touch options , you ca n't go back to this uh right away now . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah , you have to go back . yeah uh uh . user interface : this marketing : is n't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? user interface : i do n't know . marketing : with the minus and the plus . user interface : i think it 's marketing : i think it 's easier than user interface : i do n't know . i i thought it was uh easier to handle this way , marketing : yeah . user interface : but i do n't know what they think . industrial designer : sorry ? marketing : user interface : would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ? marketing : for sound and channel . industrial designer : depends on the screen . if you make the screen vertical it does n't matter . if you make it uh in a rectangle user interface : right well if we make it like this , i think if you marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i so it 's it 's it 's it 's user interface : put it like this industrial designer : square . marketing : i think it 's it 's easier to have it something like oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . a minus here , plus over here . industrial designer : oh , okay . marketing : and on here . user interface : yeah . marketing : the other buttons and on here the top . user interface : yeah . marketing : the options and then you have something like uh the p_ over here , user interface : but i think i wou marketing : and the sound . user interface : i think that 's a matter of what you 're used to . marketing : something uh user interface : i think i would put a plus and a min uh here . and then the p_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle . industrial designer : uh . marketing : something like user interface : marketing : sh project manager : industrial designer : take your time . user interface : marketing : plus minus plus uh user interface : almost . marketing : minus . user interface : but i think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus . marketing : yeah i think you 're going to s you 're going to use it with one thumb . user interface : yeah but i think yeah i do n't know . perhaps i have some examples . i do n't know industrial designer : we 'll leave that to the usability engineering then . marketing : who 's the usability engineering ? user interface : that 's me . marketing : she is . user interface : but i 'm going to look if i 've got some examples industrial designer : user interface : 'cause perhaps you should choose what 's most often used . marketing : oh . user interface : the 'cause they can use that better . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um industrial designer : consistency . user interface : yeah . marketing : oh i have that those s numbers . user interface : i here is our here are uh marketing : or a good watch . user interface : i do n't really know . project manager : everybody 's searching in his data . user interface : yeah . marketing : channel selection . per hour one hundred and sixty eight . volume selection four times an hour user interface : yeah but but i mean if it 's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote . industrial designer : yeah . so not how much n not how often it 's used , but marketing : uh user interface : w what 's what 's usual or normal . marketing : yeah , that depends on on on the remote . user interface : yes i 'm looking here . but here 's it 's below , here also , and now here 's here 's next to each other . i think it 's it 's a marketing : i think because i have two televisions at home . one is horizontal , one is vertical , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah it does it does n't really matter , marketing : so it depends . industrial designer : but marketing : yeah . depends . user interface : i think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , because you go higher and down . marketing : yeah , lower . user interface : and the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back . that 's how it 's is usually when i look here marketing : true . user interface : that 's what i see . industrial designer : okay , um . let 's cut to the chase . user interface : marketing : it 's got to change . project manager : yeah well i think we have we do n't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons user interface : i do n't know . project manager : just the marketing : yeah is it is user interface . project manager : concepts . user interface : yeah . marketing : component . user interface : this concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a industrial designer : okay , well le yeah . interface , yeah . user interface : and the speech uh shall we implement that ? or uh project manager : yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ? industrial designer : technologies , uh . marketing : yeah i think it 's it 's easy for that , where are you , but then it says i 'm here . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . but then you should also find a place industrial designer : makes it possible to marketing : yeah . user interface : you could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . you can talk into the corner . marketing : yeah , a microphone , yeah . industrial designer : not even necessary , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote . project manager : yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there 's also a microphone uh user interface : yeah . but yeah , that 's also . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : over there . industrial designer : right . user interface : so , in the middle or something . industrial designer : but that 's not import i think that 's not im very important project manager : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : because yeah , it does n't matter where the microphone is . user interface : but you should uh decide where you want to put it . industrial designer : ah okay , sure , okay , user interface : right ? industrial designer : well tha marketing : um i think where it is n't seen industrial designer : underneath ? indeed . it should n't be uh very uh visible . marketing : the most . user interface : you could p you could put it in a logo of the company . marketing : inside . project manager : yeah . well industrial designer : yeah sure , why no marketing : yeah . project manager : maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out marketing : i i between the round of the r_ . user interface : yeah . project manager : because i think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it , marketing : yeah . project manager : because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control . user interface : yeah . so where do you want to put it ? marketing : yeah , okay . project manager : well maybe where the one hand industrial designer : yeah but it does n't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh user interface : yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it . marketing : yeah . yeah user interface : it 's a way for you to uh marketing : bu but user interface : so it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes do n't have that . industrial designer : yeah , okay . project manager : but are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ? user interface : about a microphone , project manager : yeah because a microphone is very small thing , user interface : there is no button . project manager : but you can make it look like it 's big so as its its really an important function of the remote . user interface : yeah . marketing : i think the left s under corner should be the best . where is n't i it is n't most in sight . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . well put it there . i do n't mind . marketing : i think . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : that does n't does n't really matter . marketing : no . actually does n't . industrial designer : okay . so ? user interface : alright . any more uh project manager : so well uh industrial designer : interface type . project manager : type , supplements , anything . yeah , well we already s discussed that , huh , the the lcd industrial designer : the lcd yeah , project manager : and user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh supplements well the supplement is to marketing : i think i thought the , like you said , like scroll next to the remote is n't that handy . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : i think it 's better to just up what you 'd like to do on the screen . if you want to go back you have to back button go back , user interface : yeah . marketing : if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . user interface : um yeah . yeah industrial designer : . user interface : the the young people do like uh scroll uh industrial designer : use the scroll . yeah i think so too . marketing : yeah ? you do like it ? industrial designer : so why not , on on side . user interface : or at least yeah i do n't know if it 's really the scroll , but the menu they like most , and i think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh industrial designer : fast , yeah . so if you 've got a settings , if you marketing : yeah i think it is is faster . becau i think the scroll 's easier if you have a lot of options , industrial designer : yes . marketing : but if you do n't have a lot of option then user interface : but you have it 's f uh industrial designer : you have a lot of options , user interface : we have five or four or something . industrial designer : because when you use yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : uh-huh . yeah , okay , true . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so then it 's uh very handy to to scroll down , marketing : okay . industrial designer : you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . just put it on the side and it 's very easy to use . marketing : okay , no problem . project manager : and i think i would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side"
