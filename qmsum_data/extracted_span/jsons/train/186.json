    "answer": "phd a : yeah . grad b : and so what uh uh a s you s let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance wo n't really give us is what the person actually wants . does he wan na go there to see it ? does he wan na go there now ? later ? how does the person wan na go there ? is that person more likely to want to walk there ? walk a scenic route ? and so forth . there are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things . and we are constructing and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role . information related to the user and information related to the situation . and we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that what we can get from the utterance . that 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wan na go there to look at it . and um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention was . and then enrich or augment the m - three - l structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance . so if it can make a good suggestion , `` hey ! `` you know , `` that person does n't wan na enter . that person just wants to take a picture , `` cuz he just bought film , or `` that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before `` . or `` that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something and that you usually do inside of buildings `` and so forth . these ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the m - three - l structure in an sort of subfield that we have reserved . and if the action planner does something with it , great . if not you know , then that 's also something um that we ca n't really at least we { comment } want to offer the extra information . we do n't really um we 're not too worried . phd a : mm - hmm . grad b : i mean t s ultimately if you have if you can offer that information , somebody 's gon na s do something with it sooner or later . that 's sort of part of our belief . grad e : what was he saying ? grad b : um , for example , right now i know the gis from email is not able to calculate these viewpoints . so that 's a functionality that does n't exist yet to do that dynamically , phd a : mm - hmm . grad b : but if we can offer it that distinction , maybe somebody will go ahead and implement it . surely nobody 's gon na go ahead and implement it if it 's never gon na be used , so . what have i forgotten about ? oh yeah , how we do it , professor f : well th uh grad b : yeah that 's the professor f : no no . it 's a good time to pause . i s i see questions on peoples ' faces , so why do n't let 's let 's let 's hear phd a : well the obvious one would be if if you envision this as a module within smartkom , where exactly would that sit ? that 's the d grad b : um so far i 've thought of it as sort of adding it onto the modeler knowledge module . phd a : ok , yeah . grad b : so this is one that already adds additional information to the phd a : makes perfect sense . yes . grad d : hmm , ah . grad b : but it could sit anywhere in the attention - recognition i mean basically this is what attention - recognition literally sort of can phd a : well it 's supposed to do . yeah professor f : that 's what it should do . phd a : yeah . professor f : right , phd a : yeah . professor f : yeah . grad b : yeah . phd a : well f from my understanding of what the people at phillips were originally trying to do does n't seem to quite fit into smartkom currently so what they 're really doing right now is only selecting among the alternatives , the hypotheses that they 're given enriched by the domain knowledge and the um discourse modeler and so on . grad b : yeah . phd a : so if if this is additional information that could be merged in by them . grad b : yeah . phd a : and then it would be available to action planning and and others . grad b : yeah . the professor f : let 's let 's that w ok that was one question . is there other other things that cuz we wan na not pa - pass over any you know , questions or concerns that you have . phd a : well there 're there 're two levels of of giving an answer and i guess on both levels i do n't have any um further questions . grad d : mmm . mmm . phd a : uh the the two levels will be as far as i 'm concerned as uh standing here for the generation module and the other is is my understanding of what smartkom uh is supposed to be professor f : right . phd a : and i i think that fits in perfectly professor f : so well , let me let me s expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation . phd a : yeah . professor f : so the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig um robert did n't bring it today but there 's a a belief - net which is there 's a first cut at a belief - net that that does n't it is n't fully uh instantiated , and in particular some of the the combination rules and ways of getting the the conditional probabilities are n't there . but we believe that we have laid out the fundamental decisions in this little space phd a : mm - hmm . professor f : and the things that influence them . so one of the decisions is what we call this ave thing . do you want to um access , view or enter a thing . so that 's a a discrete decision . phd a : mm - hmm . professor f : there are only three possibilities and the uh what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to add which of those it is and give it to the planner . phd a : mm - hmm . professor f : but , uh th the current design suggests that if it seems to be an important decision and if the belief - net is equivocal so that it does n't say that one of these is much more probable than the other , then an option is to go back and ask for the information you want . phd a : mm - hmm . professor f : alright ? now there are two ways one can go a imagine doing that . for the debugging we 'll probably just have a a drop - down menu and the while you 're debugging you will just ok . but for a full system , then one might very well formulate a query , phd a : mm - hmm . professor f : give it to the dialogue planner and say this , you know ar are you know you are you planning to enter ? or whatever it whatever that might be . so that 's under that model then , there would be a uh um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query , presumably give it to you . that would get expressed and then hopefully you know , you 'd get an answer back . and that would of course the answer would have to be parsed . grad d : mmm . yep . professor f : right and ok so , th that uh , we probably wo n't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that . but while we 're on the subject i just wanted to give you a sort of head 's up that it could be that some months from now we said `` ok we 're now ready to try to close that loop `` in terms of querying about some of these decisions ."
