    "answer": "marketing : oh right okay . i cover myself up . project manager : i feel like madonna with one of these on . i said i feel like madonna with one of these on . industrial designer : marketing : . project manager : marketing : i 've always wanted one of these , i really have . where do you buy 'em from ? they 're . project manager : user interface : marketing : project manager : right . hello everybody . user interface : hello . project manager : back again for another wonderful meeting . industrial designer : . marketing : project manager : is uh everyone ready ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : almost . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , we c we can hold on for a minute . marketing : oh my gosh . project manager : i figured with the spam thing , if you ca n't beat it , join in . user interface : marketing : user interface : that 's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . marketing : industrial designer : mm 'kay . project manager : are you ready ? okay , right , well , i take it that you are all ready now . marketing : project manager : um alright first off we 'll just uh recap from our last meeting . um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , marketing : project manager : and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what 's going on . um what we are gon na talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it 's a tv remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh r_ and d_ for that , that 's research and development for those that have n't heard that before , user interface : marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : see i 'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . um yeah , we 're gon na hear your uh th three little presentations , marketing : project manager : whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . user interface : hmm . do you have any preference uh of order ? project manager : um i 'd like to um hear marketing : project manager : o i 'd like to hear who 's g who 's on the um from from uh catherine actually first . i want what i 'd like to hear about is uh if we 've finally decided on um what sort of energy we 're gon na be using and industrial designer : marketing : batteries . user interface : i think she is still finishing her . industrial designer : no no no no , it 's fine i 'm just preparing . project manager : it 's just that yeah , let 's let 's hear from you first . industrial designer : okay . where is that thing ? user interface : okay , it 's uh marketing : it 's here . industrial designer : oh sorry , could n't see . marketing : industrial designer : would that work ? project manager : get yourself in position . industrial designer : okay , so that 's me again . um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which would n't be v would n't be v v project manager : i do n't think any of us remember the fifties . user interface : is it like a crank thing or something . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . it would n't be very fancy . marketing : industrial designer : you can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . so if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . or you can use solar cells , but i 'm not sure about that indoors , really , but user interface : well , there 's sometimes combinations , i mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? does anybody know ? industrial designer : i dunno actually . user interface : uh i think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but i do n't know . industrial designer : i dunno . um . think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and uh if we want something fancier , i think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but i do n't know if it 's worth the cost . so we 've got to discuss that . project manager : mm . okay , jolly good . industrial designer : for the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . you can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what i mean , so project manager : what 's a double curved one ? industrial designer : you know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . and th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you ca n't use it for if you if we 're choosing a double curved case , we ca n't choose titanium . and if we are choosing um solar cells then we ca n't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . but if we 're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . and i think we discussed earlier on the r_ s_ i_ problem thing , so we could uh project manager : so that might be an idea of using the rubber , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : but then it should , you know user interface : let 's have a squeezable remote . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . and also it does n't break as easily maybe , project manager : when a tv programme 's got one industrial designer : i dunno user interface : project manager : watching the match and your team 's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it 'll bounce off the wall back at you . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , i like that idea . industrial designer : so rubber would be okay . marketing : i think rubber 's project manager : rubber , we 're all we 're all going we 're all liking that idea ? you think you can market that ? marketing : but after my after my fashion thing , i think you 'll realise that rubber is more project manager : ooh , we like rubber , ooh . industrial designer : uh s so if d marketing : people . industrial designer : okay . and then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um lcd , which gives you a display . um scroll buttons , as well . project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : so if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . so if we 're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . project manager : well , we 're gon na go with i think we 've decided that it 's gon na be a rubber case so industrial designer : so it 's a constraint . yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? if it 's not a double curved , then we 've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it 's a double curve , we 've got ta go for rubber push-buttons . if that makes sense . project manager : push buttons instead of the wheel ? industrial designer : yeah . . user interface : if it 's rubber , is n't it malleable anyway , it does n't matter if it 's double i mean is n't a rubber case , mean it 's completely flexed , i mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? mean so what 's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? project manager : rubble double double . industrial designer : no , but na le you see , you 've got , okay , the energy that 's one thing , project manager : i 'll have a big mac , please . industrial designer : then you have the case is uh , whether it 's flat or curved . and that 's we do n't care if it 's rub rubber or not , but then we 've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . so if we 've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it 's flat , single curved or double curved . and i 'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go i dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . so , either user interface : okay . industrial designer : i dunno we just need to decide on the on the case . project manager : let 's have rubber push buttons , hey . user interface : okay . go rubber . go rubber the whole way . industrial designer : let 's go crazy . and then , do i have a last slide ? yes , i do . um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that 's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gon na be the cheapest . uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that 's a higher price range . if we get an advanced chip which is um used for the lcd , the display thing , then that 's even more expensive . project manager : simple , yeah . chip on print . it 's a bit . okay , uh what i 'm not understanding here is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which i presume is like one p_c_b_ and that 's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? industrial designer : . yeah . marketing : industrial designer : the infra-red . yeah . project manager : right . um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? industrial designer : well , if if it 's not chip on print then , i guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and does n't include the infra-red . it 's less expensive mm project manager : so it sounds industrial designer : technically speaking , it 's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . project manager : so , why would we not go for that ? if it 's something that 's inside the the unit . i it does n't affects whether the customer 's gon na buy it or not . industrial designer : fo it does n't , yeah , yeah , yeah . totally . yeah . project manager : um we wan na go for an i i all industrial designer : so let 's not go for the project manager : so long as it works , industrial designer : yeah , yeah . i agree . project manager : you know . so let 's not let 's uh not bother with the chip on print . industrial designer : so it 's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . project manager : yeah . s yeah , push buttons . marketing : what about the just developed uh sample sensor ? user interface : i think push-buttons is project manager : what about what ? marketing : g there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . industrial designer : well project manager : well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? marketing : mm , i dunno . be cool . industrial designer : it 'd be it 'd be cool , but they are saying they 've just developed it , user interface : yeah . marketing : channel two . industrial designer : i 'm just guessing . but it 's gon na be the most expensive option , probably and user interface : th the the speech recognition um option is it does n't seem really very promising for us uh , project manager : yeah . it 's not something that we wan na t go into with this product . user interface : 'cause uh the yeah the example that they 're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um that when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . so you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello rick , or whatever . project manager : yeah . user interface : but , i mean , it 's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the tv on like , turn the tv on , and i turns comes on , but it 's not that . it just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response . marketing : oh , it just gives an answer . user interface : so , yeah , i mean , like what 's the point of saying , hello remote , i mean , hello , how how are you ? marketing : oh , then then project manager : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : just if you are really lonely , maybe . marketing : i thought i thought it was when they said user interface : yeah , if you 're really lonely , it is it 's marketing : i thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , industrial designer : channel five . and then it switches on . marketing : channel five , and it will change . user interface : no , tha that w that w that would be more promising . marketing : like you talk to it . can i have channel five ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : it it 's just a remote that talks to you . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : uh . i mean to certain cues . marketing : oh , then forget about it . oh right okay . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay , so i 'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . so for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the user interface : 'kay . yeah , i 'm fine with the basic battery . project manager : basic battery . it 's cheap , it 's cheerful , it 's worked , does work . industrial designer : cheaper option . are you happy with that ? marketing : mm . yeah . industrial designer : okay . so we 'll go for the battery . then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? project manager : we were go we were going with the late with the the r_s_i_ rubber , were n't we ? user interface : yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . project manager : the the marketing : so it will look like something like this . industrial designer : double ? project manager : the double whopper , please . industrial designer : okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , project manager : yep , but we 're going for the simple buttons . user interface : so rubber rubber keys , yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and that 's fine ? project manager : and it 's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it user interface : yeah . project manager : as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the r_ people were getting the complaining about r_s_i_ , and this is anti-r_s_i_ . marketing : . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : so that 's another marketing point that we can use . marketing : well the rubber push-buttons . do n't you have to move your project manager : but anything is gon na have buttons . even if it 's a jog wheel , it 's still repetitive . you industrial designer : i thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a project manager : you see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . industrial designer : that they do n't . project manager : it 's the v it 's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . user interface : . project manager : it 's not actually what you are doing . industrial designer : project manager : but the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-r_s_i_ ps specific user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , the rubber 's good . user interface : we 're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , so they can sit there and go like user interface : not that watching tv should be that stressful . project manager : and you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah . marketing : user interface : oh yeah , i guess tv can be stressful , yeah , if you 're watching sports . marketing : industrial designer : alright , that 's me done . project manager : okay , gabriel . let 's um let 's let 's hear from you about the um it 's the interface . user interface : alright . alright . yeah , some of what i have to say ties into what catherine was just talking about . project manager : great . industrial designer : sorry . user interface : okay , so i 'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . and so basically i consulted with our manufacturing division . it sounded like catherine was also speaking with them . uh i also took uh reissa 's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause i think that 's that 's crucial as far as uh what keys we 're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they 're laid out . uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . so i already mentioned the speech recognition interface . marketing : user interface : i guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . it 's it 's pointless . uh it 's just a sample sensor sample output . it would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the tv . uh so yeah , they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m_p_ three player like ipod . um so we 've already addressed that and i think that would actually be worse for something like r_s_i_ i mean you got that thumb movement that you 're constantly doing . project manager : yeah . user interface : um the other suggestion , marketing : that does get annoying . user interface : and i i have a feeling that we 're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : or uh something for the elderly , where the remote 's very large and the buttons are very large and there 's only a few buttons . but you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . project manager : yeah . user interface : uh um so , the key layout and design are really crucial . you do n't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . and i did n't mention that we need a power button in our last i can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout industrial designer : user interface : uh from our manufacturing department . so this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a v_ on both of them , so uh project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : it 's sort of confusing for the user . uh this is the example of the giant remote that 's impossible to lose . project manager : do we have an uh example of a good one ? brilliant . industrial designer : marketing : uh-huh . well user interface : and for something for kids . yeah . um . project manager : yeah . user interface : and so , yeah , i th i think my personal preferences of we 've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . uh so i was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . i think it should be more general . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : i did n't i did n't think the spinning-wheel or the uh l_c_ display were were crucial for us . and , yeah , that 's it for me . project manager : okay . well let 's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? the um the the um the interface type we 're going for user interface : so we 're we 're not gon na have any sort of display i think uh . project manager : just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . user interface : so , yeah , it 's just gon na be just gon na be push-buttons . um . i think we shall have a limited number of buttons , project manager : yeah . user interface : ideally , i mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . project manager : yeah . user interface : uh . and some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . project manager : yeah . user interface : i guess it 's to the point where we need to decide about that . project manager : okay , and we 're not yeah . user interface : well now that we 've decided on our project manager : are we gon na hav hav an are we d marketing : project manager : have we decided on whether w we 're gon na s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we 're not we 're just gon na go for something user interface : um it seems like we would n't wan na make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , project manager : we 're marketing : maybe we can user interface : but um yeah , i would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the r_r_ can be yellow , or something like that . project manager : yeah . yeah . okay . okey-dokey . yeah , i do n't have any other questions on this . let 's move over to user interface : i i guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . project manager : yeah , sure . user interface : i mean , 'cause uh s so if we wan na have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . project manager : . user interface : but i think that should be i mean um , i can speak with the button department , but uh i think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . project manager : yeah , the button that just does that , yeah . user interface : so that should be simple . project manager : cool . marketing : right . well , i 'm just basically letting you know what 's happening in the markets project manager : mm yeah . marketing : and what the fashions are for next year . um . so yes , so from looking at this year 's trends and fashions project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and also recent investigation that we 've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to project manager : marketing : which we 've already probably discussed . um the most important aspect is look and feel . so the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . so it has to be project manager : yeah , why should people buy this when they 're already got a remote that came with the tv ? marketing : exactly . user interface : yeah . marketing : um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . so project manager : what 's that mean ? marketing : technologically it should be like um work , basically , i guess . it should work . user interface : well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , marketing : should user interface : i mean have something that 's little more technologically advanced than what 's on the market . marketing : that 's new . project manager : okay , now the trouble is is we 've already decided that we 're going with the stuff that works already , that 's cheap . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah . actually , i mean , these first two points we 've already sort of gone away from , marketing : yeah . user interface : 'cause our rubber one is not fancy project manager : yeah . user interface : i mean it 's different , but i would n't say like a rubber remote is fancy . if that 's what people want then we maybe we 're going in the wrong direction . and it 's it 's not technologically innovative either . project manager : maybe we could um marketing : so , no loose that 's why i was thinking , bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up bluetooth , and it 's like a bluetooth remote control , everybody 's gon na like , oh , 'cause bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and um when it comes to marketing like that 's what people go for , they do n't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . project manager : of course , they do . marketing : well , they do , but it 's like it 's not project manager : one hundred per cent , that 's your first thing , you go , oh i 'm not gon na buy that , 'cause i dunno if it works or not . marketing : yeah , but it looks good . if it looks good and it 's it can just be there for decoration . project manager : okay , well , what do you two think about this ? user interface : so is is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other marketing : but like project manager : yeah , what i do n't understand what m user interface : electronics ? marketing : you could always insert , yeah . user interface : yeah , that 's basically what it allows you to do , project manager : yeah , user interface : right ? project manager : and it this is just gon na all this is being used for is your television . marketing : yeah , but , i mean , people like project manager : it would that would mean you 'd need a television that has bluetooth in it , which no no television does , marketing : well , if you 're looking at if you looking at something that 's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . industrial designer : well project manager : does it ? that would mean we 'd have to make a television as well . industrial designer : bluetooth would , for example , enable you , i think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you 're being called by this person right now . things like that . project manager : no , that would be your telephone in with your television . user interface : yeah , the that would n't be the remote so much , project manager : yeah , user interface : i mean industrial designer : no , but if you get bluetooth on the remote , you 'd be able to project manager : nah , the televi the television would have to be a bluetooth compatible , basically . industrial designer : i with the television , yeah . i was just trying to find an advantage . wha what w what advantage would you get for the marketing : well , it does n't project manager : an and there is no there is no such thing marketing : like it does n't have to be , you know , bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . whether it 's a battery it could be something really really minor , you know , like but i think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people 've already seen it , people 've already got it . project manager : okay . marketing : if we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative . industrial designer : maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . it 's been done for watches , but i have n't seen that for remotes , yet . project manager : okay . yeah , this that 's that 's very good . marketing : and then you can market it . never have to change a battery again . industrial designer : change the batteries ever again . project manager : and and this is all tying in very nicely . marketing : project manager : the fact that it 's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . industrial designer : yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . user interface : yes , so can project manager : but yeah , by the squeezing it the marketing : i think , safety s user interface : yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator . project manager : yeah , that 's a great idea . well done . marketing : yeah . third most important aspect uh is it 's easy to use . user interface : we 're all about that . marketing : and i think we 've all um worked that out . um okay , in the fashion , how it 's supposed to look . next year 's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . so next year people will be buying , i found this really funny , you know , strawberry shaped chairs , industrial designer : user interface : okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : i wan na watch the pineapple channel . marketing : rubber things . um and as it 's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it 's it 's not quite spongy , but spongy , i would say is user interface : . project manager : well spongy , that 's where . yeah , we 're we 're ahead of the game there . user interface : yeah , that 's great for us . marketing : yeah , so we 're in . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . and so personal what i was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company 's image , basically . so yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : . i had to say user interface : right . marketing : so we 're moving in the right direction like project manager : alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , user interface : yeah . project manager : so through all that we 've we go we 're right , we 're gon na go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , industrial designer : yep . user interface : yeah , that 's great . project manager : that 's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-r_s_i_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , marketing : mm . project manager : and um i 'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . industrial designer : no vegetables . marketing : user interface : yeah , i do n't know how we incorporate project manager : . marketing : user interface : we do n't have to follow every trend , i guess . marketing : maybe make it like fruity colours or something . user interface : uh-huh . marketing : some sort . or user interface : the power button could be like a big apple or something . industrial designer : well yeah , but apple would sue you for that . marketing : project manager : yeah , this is true . user interface : they don they do n't own all images of apples . project manager : industrial designer : sued the beatles so user interface : okay , we 'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate . industrial designer : project manager : well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we have n't really finally um agreed on is its image . like , yeah , we 're we 're saying no we do n't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , user interface : . project manager : or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? marketing : well i think , if it 's rubber it needs to be project manager : i mean you said earlier on i it should be funky . marketing : different . i think , it 's it should be i mean , what do you associate with rubber ? you know like project manager : l keep it clean , keep it clean . marketing : really different colours basically . industrial designer : marketing : okay , sor i sorry , i used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? um industrial designer : marketing : um like i 'm just thinking bright colours . user interface : yeah . marketing : bright natural colours , nothing too project manager : bright , but not too bright . marketing : bright , but too not yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . wan na make it different colours so anybody can choo like like project manager : like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? marketing : yeah . and on the back of it have the logo . project manager : okay , what ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : sure . industrial designer : why not ? project manager : okay . tha user interface : the one thing i 'm wondering about , i hope that we 're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having project manager : yeah , i mean we that 's we we user interface : i mean if somebody go goes into the store they 're gon na see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . marketing : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : this is the remote control tomato . user interface : i mean what are ninety per cent of people gon na take ? marketing : well i can say in this country , you 'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , mummy i wan na buy that one . project manager : marketing : and uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it 's um like kids wo n't break it , it 's not breakable if you throw it around . project manager : yeah . marketing : especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and yeah . the only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but project manager : well , it 's it 's got ta be chew proof . user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : industrial designer : i 'm gon na write that down . marketing : so user interface : marketing : so it 's rea it 's quite project manager : marketing : it 's quite like um user friendly industrial designer : marketing : and also for different families ,
