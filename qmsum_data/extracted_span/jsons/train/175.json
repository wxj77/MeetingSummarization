    "answer": "janet finch-saunders am : thank you , chair . i wish to speak to amendments 1a to 1e , which relate to the deputy minister 's amendment on the duty to promote public awareness . while we believe it is absolutely imperative that the public are made aware of this controversial change in the law , the deputy minister 's amendment lacks a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at stage 1 . an important thread runs throughout each and every amendment that i 've tabled within this group\u2014that of a sustained awareness campaign , which not only stretches beyond the implementation of the bill , but serves as a duty for future administrations . amendment 1a : primarily , amendment 1a changes amendment 1 to include the promotion of understanding changes to the law . i do n't think it 's enough for the welsh government to say that the public should be made aware of the coming into force of section 1 and that a public awareness campaign needs to be sustained until the welsh government 's objectives have been achieved . despite the fact that it is intended to change behaviour , the consequences of this law are far greater than that of organ donation or prohibiting smoking indoors . instead of an opt-out system or a civil offence , this law will remove a defence for parents , information on which could be there on their records for the rest of their lives , potentially separate parents , and could affect employment chances . as such , whilst we agree with the necessity of the awareness campaign , it is important too that the welsh government take stock and ensures that parents are not penalised due to a weak awareness campaign . the witnesses we heard before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands\u2014 lynne neagle am : janet , dawn is asking if you 'll take an intervention . dawn bowden am : i just wanted to know\u2014could you give us examples of any other piece of legislation where there 's been indefinite public awareness campaigns once it 's been passed ? janet finch-saunders am : there 's a lot of legislation . the first assembly term when i was here\u2014 dawn bowden am : yes , what i 'm asking\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : i 'm trying to respond\u2014 dawn bowden am : what i 'm asking for is : can you give us specific examples of where there have been indefinite public awareness campaigns running indefinitely past the enactment of a piece of legislation ? janet finch-saunders am : the very first term that i was an assembly member , we passed 25 pieces of separate legislation . even today , as i sit here , the public are not aware of many of those pieces of legislation . this particular piece of legislation will have a profound effect on the parenting of children in wales . so , therefore , i think there is a necessity for both children and parents to become involved , and i shall speak now\u2014 dawn bowden am : with respect , chair , that 's not the question i asked . janet finch-saunders am : \u2014to my amendments . lynne neagle am : i can call you in the debate , if you 'd like to make a more substantive contribution on this . yes . janet finch-saunders am : the witnesses who we heard from before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands the implications . and that 's what we 're talking about here , members\u2014the implications of removing this defence . strikingly , the office of police and crime commissioner for gwent stated the following : 'the potential for public resistance to the bill through misunderstanding or confusion over it implications may pose the largest barrier to its implementation . ' if you are intent on removing the defence of reasonable punishment , it is therefore not unreasonable to ensure that law-abiding parents fully understand the ramifications of this bill . additionally , the committee found that while the current welsh government 's intention to deliver a public awareness campaign was beyond doubt , future governments may have less of a commitment . this places further weight on the fact that the welsh government should be under a duty to promote awareness and understanding of the bill beyond its commencement . furthermore , the children ( equal protection from assault ) ( scotland ) bill quite clearly notes that , under section 2 , the scottish ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of section 1 on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment . therefore , i would be grateful if the deputy minister can respond as to the reasons why the welsh government has deviated from this course of action in their amendment . [ interruption . ] should our amendment be agreed\u2014 lynne neagle am : are you taking an intervention ? janet finch-saunders am : no . i 'd rather crack on , to be honest . lynne neagle am : okay . i can call you in the debate , hefin ."
