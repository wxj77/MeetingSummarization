    "answer": "ms. raquel dancho : mr . chair , i did n't hear any answers from the minister 's remarks , unfortunately . moving on , there are two issues regarding the 50 % commercial rent assistance subsidy , where landlords pay 25 % , the government pays 50 % , and the tenant is responsible for 25 % . first , many of the small landlords are n't able to take a 25 % hit to their income , and are unable to provide the subsidy to their tenants . second , with the 70 % decline in revenue threshold for small businesses to even be eligible for the rent assist , many restaurants are at 65 % or 67 % decline . they desperately need this subsidy but are n't able to qualify . this is not about problems with the program details . what is the government planning to do to streamline this program for small businesses that ca n't access but desperately need the rent subsidy ?"
