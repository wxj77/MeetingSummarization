    "query": "<s> what did marketing discuss about improving new remote control features based on the questionnaire ?",
    "answer": "marketing : okay . 'kay , welcome . i have some uh new findings on uh marketing expert level , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : which i will show you . the method i used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . um one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results . um , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . um , we have three audiences of two audiences , i 'm sorry . uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five . um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five . uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . mm and some interests from the from the age groups , uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an lcd screen on the remote control , um speech recognition . i do n't think that 's uh really appropriate . um , and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh yeah , they do n't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . so that 's maybe something for the user interface uh designer . okay , third findings . according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um following buttons are most important . um , i will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . um , persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . um , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . switching channels , um yeah , that 's pretty uh pretty normal , that 's what you do with a remote control . um the second , teletext , uh and the third , uh volume controls . um , i think it 's good uh that we know what the user want wants , uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear . project manager : but it 's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet . so that that 's strange . marketing : yeah , okay . yeah , okay , but uh at the moment uh teletext is yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on tv , like getting information . project manager : yeah , okay . yeah . marketing : so uh , when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . project manager : okay . yeah , okay . marketing : that 's ridiculous . project manager : yeah . marketing : that 's a ne i it it 's a new technology , project manager : yeah . marketing : but it 's not incorporated right now . okay , my personal preferences . um , i think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five . mm , first of all um it 's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . uh second , i think you will get the most revenue from i from it . um , yeah , people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of tv , more than uh people who are el uh elder . um second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as i said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire , uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it 's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the tv project manager : yeah , that 's a cool idea . marketing : where you can put the the remote control in . um , that 's about it , i think . yeah . industrial designer : when you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about ? marketing : uh not not the r not the functions , industrial designer : uh , the funtionability . marketing : but uh it came out that a lot of buttons were n't even used uh on a remote control . so you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , but if you do n't use them , yeah it 's project manager : yeah . industrial designer : ah okay , so focusing more on the used buttons . marketing : yeah , they have to be on it industrial designer : yeah . marketing : j just to t to get it done if necessary , user interface : marketing : but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or industrial designer : could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example . marketing : yeah , perhaps . industrial designer : thank you . marketing : just for the minor functions perhaps . industrial designer : yeah , ma perhaps , just just an idea . marketing : just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah ? 'kay , that 's it ."
