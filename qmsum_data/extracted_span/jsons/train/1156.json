    "answer": "user interface : well i think i find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it 's handiest when you have one that works both the d_v_d_ player or whatever and the tv as well . um , but that it 's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons and so i think it 's is best when they 're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you 're supposed to use , you know . project manager : any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ? or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? are there you know , bad ones they 've used or good ones they 've used or ones that they 've lost and never found again ? industrial designer : um i think it 's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it 'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you should n't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the tv to actually pick up the signal . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : think a lot of the time , remotes that come with tv players and tvs and d_v_ players , like they are n't like an area that 's put a lot of effort into , they 're very boring , very plain . like it 's very a very like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . project manager : um what so wh what 's in in what particular style features are you thinking about ? marketing : um . something that looks looks does n't look like remote control . industrial designer : marketing : so if you want , something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh what 's this ? like this pen does n't really look like a pen , project manager : uh-huh . marketing : but it makes you think oh . project manager : . yeah marketing : so , sorry that 's a bit vague . project manager : d no i mean do you think there 's a risk if it does n't look like remote control , people wo n't see it as a remote control um and uh marketing : uh i suppose suppose that 's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product . project manager : uh-huh . any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ? user interface : i think something that 's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things and uh they 're kind of awkward to hold onto , marketing : user interface : so something that 's more comfortable that fits in a person 's hand better . project manager : i mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um i mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : and s you know some quite fancy ones um than the user interface : yeah . project manager : some from personal experience which look nice industrial designer : project manager : but are n't particularly comfortable . um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh user interface : yeah . marketing : well from the mouse idea you could , remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button . project manager : yes , i mean the only thing is if if you 're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh marketing : i suppose . project manager : fi find the button buttons easily . marketing : easily , yeah yeah . user interface : but maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them better . project manager : yeah , that 's uh must admit i do n't think i 've ever seen one with concave buttons , that 's uh certainly be different . um do we need it to uh i ca n't think of any re remote controls that i know of that actually light up at all . user interface : oh yeah . project manager : do we do we want uh industrial designer : mm that would be good . user interface : like a like a mobile phone ? project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah ."
