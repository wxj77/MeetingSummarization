    "answer": "lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now from hefin david on neurodevelopmental services . hefin david am : i think , chair , i should have declared an interest here , as my daughter has been diagnosed with autism and is currently going through the process of receiving neurodevelopmental speech and language support particularly . we 're seeing an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals , and that will increase further in the future . can you give us an explanation as to why this demand is growing and how we 're going to meet capacity to deliver and for support for those children ? carol shillabeer : thank you . they 're very big questions in terms of 'why ' . i 'm not sure that anyone really knows why , if i 'm honest , although there is a lot of academic research going on . what we do know is that we are starting to see the scale of those referrals coming through . so , in the information provided , i refer to the nhs digital prevalence report in england , which indicates that about 5.5 per cent of two to four-year-olds have a mental disorder . now , that sounds a bit shocking when we say that , but that 's in the international classification scaling , and , of that , certainly , 2.5 per cent is around autism . i can just testify , in real life , that demand is absolutely growing . so , if i just take my own health board for a moment , we usually have about 75 referrals per year . last year we had 300 . so , that has felt very difficult to manage . if i can just give you a sense of what we 've done so far and then what i think is next , i want to recognise the work of dr cath norton and the steering group that 's been established on neurodevelopmental issues under the programme . they had a standing start . they 've done a lot of very , very good work . we now have seven teams in place across wales . we now have a national pathway . we now have a community-of-practice-type environment , and we 're really getting into this . good progress has been made . more people have been seen . more people have been assessed . so , we have made progress . but i 've got a long list of considerations that i think respond to your question . one is that most referrals that come through , the clinicians tell me , are seeking support to move through what they perceive to be a gateway for educational support . so , that is often the reason why people come . now , that is obviously going to be linked to the whole-school approach and how we can support that . demand is outstripping supply . so , our clinical teams are concerned about how do they keep up . so , if i just take my own example of 300 in the last year , we 're looking to try and put some additional capacity in to support seeing those families , but also then to understand what the long-term trajectory is going to be . because we 've put these teams in , because we 've got the new pathway , has that opened a gate and we 've got a lot of backlog or is that the pattern ? hefin david am : can i just ask a question there ? so , with regard to the 75 to 300 increase\u2014in the space of a year was that ? carol shillabeer : in a year , yes . hefin david am : did you anticipate that or was that something that just came totally unexpected ? carol shillabeer : i think we anticipated a few more , and just to say that in my\u2014 hefin david am : but not on that scale . carol shillabeer : no , not on that scale . and in my own health board\u2014i 'm just referring to my own , and i 'm happy to share the information on this\u2014we already had a service in place . so , it was n't as if we had nothing in place previously . we had a nice-compliant service already in place , but we knew we needed to expand that , which we have done , but we did n't anticipate 300 . so , this is happening not just across wales , actually , but across the uk\u2014so , this greater recognition , the desire for families coming forward to access that support and them seeing this as a route , which is really important . what i would also say , and this is part of the bigger picture that we need to consider going forward , is that only about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of those families that come forward have what i would call or the clinicians would call a diagnosis\u2014so , a threshold or whatever term you want to use that takes people through to that educational support . so , we 've got a lot of people who are under that threshold , but that 's a lot of people who still need help and support . i 'm trying to very fairly and , i hope , appropriately represent the very strong views coming from the group\u2014the workstream under the programme . we 've got to tackle all of that . it 's not going to be good enough for us just to focus our attention on those children and young people and their families who reach a threshold , because there are needs elsewhere as well , and some of that will overlap with the early help and enhanced support . some of that overlaps with learning disability services . can i just mention a few more things , as i 'm on roll on neurodevelopmental ? hefin david am : it 's up to the chair . lynne neagle am : yes , go on . carol shillabeer : is that all right ? sorry , i know it 's a very long answer . there is a concern from the neurodevelopmental group to get across that whilst there has been a lot of focus on autism\u2014and we recognise the private member 's bill\u2014there are other neurodevelopmental presentations and there 's a real\u2014 . having the broadest view would be advised by them , and i think they 're particularly keen to understand what a future vision and what we call , say , a 'perfect world ' would look like . that 's the piece of work that we 're wanting to do now . in terms of giving advice at the end of the programme and into legacy arrangements , about what the big , big things are , we are still needing to tackle . hefin david am : i mean , i personally took a very personal decision when it came to the member 's bill on autism you were talking about\u2014and that was the advice i received . you need to look at the wider symptoms that are presented beyond autism and other neurological conditions . so , i 'm glad you said that , because it gives me\u2014 . because i did n't vote for that bill , and i 'm glad you said that because it gives me some personal reassurance there . but what i do have concerns about is if the increase was n't anticipated to the extent that it was and that the together for children and young people programme has a duty to review capacity , after october who 's going to make sure that that capacity 's reviewed on a strategic basis ?"
