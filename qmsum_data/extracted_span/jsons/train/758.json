    "query": "<s> according to the group , are higher education institutions having enough preparations on expertises to react to the current situation ?",
    "answer": "mark reckless am : i understand you do n't direct , of course , but my question was about advising . you 're overseeing , or monitoring\u2014or whatever you like to describe the role as\u2014quite a number of institutions , and presumably you therefore have particular expertise within your organisation , and i just wondered whether higher education institutions are doing enough to draw on that . bethan owen : i think we can advise\u2014we can advise based on data and information that we can see . we can advise based on our judgment . the big thing in this whole brexit scenario is the uncertainty and the extent to which our speculation is better informed than the governing bodies or the sector collectively is probably the issue ."
