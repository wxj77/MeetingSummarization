    "answer": "industrial designer : yeah , uh unit price unit production price cost thing . um we implemented the basic functions , which is just tv functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . project manager : zapping your favourite channels , eh ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : scrolling through your favourites list . project manager : oh okay okay . industrial designer : zapping you know zapping . project manager : ah 'kay okay , that 's favourites . industrial designer : maybe it 's just a portuguese thing . and um yeah that was the result . project manager : ah 'kay . i like the the the the logo on there as well . industrial designer : user interface : it 's very prominent . project manager : it is very prominent . so this is the user interface : so here i 'll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here . project manager : okay . user interface : uh you 've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . this is the power button . uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ? this is the teletext . industrial designer : start s the the start uh to to to user interface : the programme button , industrial designer : programme yeah . project manager : ah , okay i see . user interface : yeah the programme button . so this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wan na use . so um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . project manager : it 's pretty cool . user interface : so you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gon na be rubber , so it 's pretty hard to actually damage it um project manager : is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? user interface : yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it industrial designer : not helping . project manager : user interface : yeah . project manager : oh well i guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . user interface : yeah and it depends on if it 's sliding , but i think it 's pretty ergonomic . you can feel it . project manager : mm . feels good . industrial designer : project manager : i take it that this is gon na be slightly lighter in the final design as well . user interface : yeah of course . well this is clay . industrial designer : project manager : yeah it 's kinda cool . you have to reach a little bit do n't you . user interface : yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but i think we might scale down the final model a bit . project manager : ah yeah that would n't make sense . user interface : these this is a bit larger than it would be , but project manager : it 's cool . i 'm impressed . industrial designer : do n't have no one to handle that . user interface : project manager : and hold it so marketing : mm that 's project manager : wh what 's the marketing perspective ? marketing : oh that 's oh i like it . i mean you guys gave me more than i was asking for , so i 'm happy because we 've got some really marketable features in this . yeah i think it 's good . good good good job . user interface : mm pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . industrial designer : yeah . so you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where 's my remote . user interface : beep beep beep . marketing : uh pla user interface : industrial designer : the locator function . marketing : i 'm ha project manager : okay . marketing : it 's great . that 's great . it 's a great feature . user interface : um beep beep beep project manager : mm it 's impressing . industrial designer : wicked is n't it ? project manager : so let me get it , user interface : so project manager : if i press this button user interface : beep beep beep project manager : i see . that 's pretty cool . hang on . user interface : beep beep beep be shut up . industrial designer : marketing : so you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he 'll be across town user interface : beep beep beep project manager : i plan to do that as well . user interface : okay . um no no no tha that 's alri project manager : so the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ? user interface : exactly that 's exactly what those are for . project manager : ah okay okay . user interface : and um there 's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is um you could industrial designer : project manager : user interface : beep beep beep industrial designer : user interface : we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger project manager : yeah it 's the right shape is n't it ? user interface : it it 's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we could n't figure out what button is important enough to put there . and we we do n't wan na accidentally be hitting the power button like that so project manager : but maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides . user interface : right . so maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , project manager : okay . user interface : but marketing : uh , i can see that . project manager : but it 's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , has n't it ? user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : yep i like . good job . project manager : so is that the the final colour scheme as well or ? marketing : no no . user interface : oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time . project manager : okay . user interface : so we 'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . project manager : the hmm . user interface : careful . project manager : it came off . the scroll wheels , a problem with them not being sort of user interface : industrial designer : project manager : i do n't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . marketing : well i mean of course , i mean user interface : industrial designer : marketing : my my s my suggestion is we 're gon na go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . you know some blend of silvers and blacks . user interface : beep beep beep . project manager : okay enough of that . industrial designer : project manager : well i it 's cool guys . 'kay so are we done with the this presentation ? user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : now now ."
