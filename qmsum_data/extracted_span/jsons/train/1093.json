    "answer": "the chair : before continuing , i want to remind honourable members who are at home to make sure that the boom on their headsets is down . it just makes a better pickup . we heard everything , but it was a little distant . that 's for everyone 's benefit . we 're now going to continue with mr.deltell . mr. grard deltell ( louis-saint-laurent , cpc ) : mr.chair , before i ask my question , i 'd like to pay tribute to the minister of justice , particularly to his versatility . today , he talked about forests . yesterday , the minister of justice talked about davie and indigenous affairs . really , this minister is very versatile . my question is directly for the minister of finance . i like mr.lametti very much , but i 'd like mr.morneau to answer my question . yesterday , in a senate parliamentary committee , the minister of finance half-opened the door to an economic update . based on what he said , it seems that , as we speak , a committee of the department of finance is working on an economic update . could mr.morneau tell canadians when he is going to table this economic update ? hon . mona fortier : mr.chair , as we know , the canadian economy is going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty . as soon as it 's possible to provide clear economic projections , we will provide a full update to canadians . right now , we can say that we have supported workers , businesses and canadians with the emergency measures we have put in place . we will continue to do so , because we need to be sure that canadians can get through this crisis . mr. grard deltell : mr.chair , i thought it was too good to be true . the minister of finance is opening the door , and the minister of small business is closing it . we do n't know when the economic update will take place , yet all across canada , provinces are doing economic updates . could mr.morneau explain to canadians why he is unable to give one ? hon . mona fortier : mr.chair , since the beginning of the crisis , we have implemented the economic action plan to respond to covid-19 , and we 've provided immediate assistance to canadians , businesses and workers . over 2.5million jobs were protected by the canada emergency wage subsidy . in addition , 8.4million canadians the chair : we are returning to mr.deltell . mr. grard deltell : mr.chair , next friday , the quebec minister of finance , ericgirard , will give an economic update . if ericgirard can give one for quebec , why ca n't billmorneau give one for canada ? hon . mona fortier : mr.chair , once again , we have been open and transparent from the outset . we have devoted our energy to support canadians , workers and businesses . we will continue to do so . mr. grard deltell : mr.chair , i can not judge the quality of the work done by the provinces , but what i do know is that quebec , saskatchewan and newfoundland have also made efforts to support their residents economically . those provinces are able to table economic updates . yesterday , saskatchewan even tabled a budget . why is bill morneau unable to table an economic update for all canadians ?"
