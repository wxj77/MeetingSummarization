project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : we should get started . marketing : yeah . project manager : uh i 'm taking notes . um marketing : okay . great . project manager : we each have a specific task , as i saw in my mail . i did n't know if you received the same mail . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : i guess so . yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay so the um uh this industrati industrial designer should produce a working design . am i correct ? industrial designer : true . project manager : okay . uh the user interface designer should specify the technical functions . right ? yeah ? and the marketing uh expert should come up with user requirements . marketing : yeah . project manager : uh did any of you already do some work on this part or industrial designer : well i started making an overview for myself , um what i had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step i have a s specific task to perform or whatever . project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : so i had to uh , i dunno , make an overview for myself about what i have to do , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how i have to fill it . project manager : mm-hmm . and do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ? industrial designer : well i started i started with the first phase , i think was the functional . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh let 's see i had to focus on the working design , which you said . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : how does the apparatus work ? and well i basically had two points . uh according to the coffee uh machine example , i have batteries to supply energy , project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the tv . project manager : mm-hmm . okay . industrial designer : and that 's basically all i have so far . project manager : yeah i got another point . it uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the tv apparatus or stereo . user interface : yeah . wireless uh huh . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : alright . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so that 's very common . user interface : uh it 's uh some buttons for for the on off function . you d you already told that . and for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume . that are the the basic options for a remote control . industrial designer : yeah . yeah i kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions , user interface : okay , yeah . industrial designer : 'cause i was n't thinking yet about that . i mean , you wan na ch ch flip the channel user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but you might wan na use teletext also . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i dunno what the word is in english . uh project manager : same i believe . marketing : yeah . project manager : uh and what did the marketing expert do ? marketing : uh well from a marketing uh perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? so there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : i mean , what functions do they have . um especially what are their shortcomings ? are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ? project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . marketing : um therefore we have to to do some internet search . for example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? project manager : yep . yes . marketing : so we can see uh what needs to be supported . um and we can interview current users and future users . what w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? um especially for future users , project manager : okay . okay . marketing : uh i 'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add . project manager : okay . and you can get that information ? marketing : i think i can get that information , yeah . project manager : okay . that would be very handy . marketing : so yeah . project manager : um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ? marketing : no n not specifically . more to how to get them project manager : no okay . user interface : i got some uh requirements marketing : and project manager : yeah ? user interface : it has uh it has to be user-friendly . marketing : yeah ? project manager : of course . industrial designer : yeah . obviously . marketing : yeah . user interface : uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . it has to be a small unit . it has to be uh yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . so it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine . project manager : big , mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . user interface : uh and a and a good uh zapping range . project manager : uh what do you mean by that ? user interface : uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance . marketing : yeah . user interface : it has to be capable for zapping uh marketing : yeah . from the other end of the room or something ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay um well i do n't think i have anything more to add at the moment . um i think the best is to go to work . industrial designer : whoa . is that you project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or alright . project manager : okay . marketing : any more points to discuss ? project manager : yeah . i think we can go ahead with what we have . i will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . uh the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . and it seems you get more information by email . so marketing : alright . industrial designer : alright . project manager : that was it for me . user interface : okay . marketing : 'kay . thanks . project manager : uh user interface : are you going to put the the notes on the project manager : yeah , in the project folder . yeah . marketing : yeah . the pro okay . user interface : okay . project manager : i 'm writing very fast . industrial designer : alright . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . okay . project manager : hope it 's readable . okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion ? marketing : i guess so . industrial designer : well no i 'm just a bit wondering what we 're gon na do the next uh session ? user interface : yeah . do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ? project manager : yeah . because then we have a user interface : after that we are going to the conceptual uh project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : y you do some individual work , marketing : we 're just working the three phases . project manager : we have meeting , individual work , meeting . and at the end of the day we have a final meeting . and then i have to prepare uh i have to defend our design , user interface : project manager : so make it good . industrial designer : yeah okay . we 'll do our best . marketing : okay . project manager : i depend on you . user interface : okay . marketing : better make it industrial designer : i am gon na work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it 's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . project manager : yeah ? if you can mix it it 's okay . mm-hmm . yeah . industrial designer : do we i mean , is it gon na be a multimedia control centre ? do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? marketing : yeah . that is my question also project manager : yeah . marketing : because like new new functions project manager : well i think that is the user requirements part . marketing : requirements . yeah . project manager : as to what they want . uh do they want all those functions on that small industrial designer : yeah . true . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but but we need good communication about this stuff , marketing : unit . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : 'cause i have to f put the components into the design . marketing : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : i would first m industrial designer : so if i do n't know what components to put in , it 's kind of hard . marketing : yeah well project manager : yeah i understand . marketing : i i was user interface : yeah . i i think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them . project manager : you can always add a few marketing : well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which i know , there 's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . project manager : yeah . marketing : so you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video . project manager : the c_d_ player . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and another function i 'll think of switch to your media centre , because that 's getting very popular . industrial designer : yeah so marketing : and then use your windows media centre under your tv with the same remote control . so with the switch , one single switch project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah i i know what you mean , but you 'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : you need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and you you do n't need that for a tv . marketing : records and stuff like that . industrial designer : and and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , project manager : you need additional yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so i kind of need to know what we uh need . marketing : yeah . project manager : uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : whatever , i 'll just put my ideas in uh in here project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting . marketing : in the project uh project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : we could just start with the assumption that 's only for tv and video . and um reserve the possibility to add other features . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so we have a basic starting point industrial designer : okay . project manager : and you can always extend that so make sure it 's extendible . yeah . user interface : yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . industrial designer : alright . marketing : yeah . user interface : so it 's has n't it 's yeah . project manager : th the least amount of functions possible user interface : yeah . project manager : so it 's easier to get to know how it works etcetera . user interface : okay . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . i understand . yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah ?
