    "query": "<s> what did kirsty williams am say about her plan for quality assurance ?",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : i am aware , and we 've listened to stakeholders ' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body . as i said , we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to estyn and qaa . so , we 've been listening to that , following the technical consultation , and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission . as i said , i do n't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation , but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent , need to be effective and need to be comprehensive . what we 're also very clear about , and i think it is important to say , is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with enqa , which i think is really , really important going forward . and by an extension of that , it would be compatible with current uk-wide baseline standards . so , we do n't want to create specific problems for the he sector in wales . sian gwenllian am : but , you have touched on this , there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector . one vice-chancellor has told us : kirsty williams am : well , sometimes , i think it is necessary , maybe , to cause a stir . if we do n't change things , it does beg the point of , 'why are any of us here if we 're not here to sometimes move things forward ? ' and change is challenging always , but i would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we 're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a european context . huw ."
