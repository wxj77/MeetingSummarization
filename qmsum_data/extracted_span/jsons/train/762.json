    "query": "<s> what are the potential difficulties after brexit for the continuation and enhancement of researcher collaborations and networks ?",
    "answer": "john griffiths am : okay . one final question : in terms of the researcher collaborations and networks that exist , do you see potential difficulties after brexit for the continuation and enhancement of those , and are there any particular lessons to learn from s\u00ear cymru ii ? dr david blaney : i think that there are two things to say here as well . first of all , the brexit deal might or might not impact adversely on the capacity of welsh and , indeed , uk research infrastructure to play into broader collaborative activity across europe , and , in a sense , that 's a function of the deal whatever the deal looks like , and we 'll have to wait and see . but we 've mentioned playing into horizon europe , and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity . it 's not just the money , it 's being in the club and it 's the signalling that we 're in the game . so , all of that would be important . and then the other part of my response to this would be that , actually , wales will need to continue to be good at the research it does , so maintaining the quality , maintaining the impact , and hopefully growing the critical mass . the s\u00ear cymru initiative has been quite important in doing that , because it 's been very focused , capturing key research players , and the attractiveness that that has then to other researchers around them , and to industry collaboration , and they have been areas of real strength that we 've invested in . and i think they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding , and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market ."
