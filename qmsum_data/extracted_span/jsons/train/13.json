    "answer": "phd f : uh , yeah . yeah . i brought some i do n't know if some figures here . well . i start we started to work on spectral subtraction . and um the preliminary results were very bad . professor a : uh - huh . phd f : so the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this , the wall uh process , which contains lda on - line normalization . and it hurts uh a lot . professor a : uh - huh . phd f : and so we started to look at at um things like this , which is , well , it 's yeah . so you have the c - zero parameters for one uh italian utterance . phd d : you can @ @ . phd f : and i plotted this for two channels . channel zero is the close mic microphone , and channel one is the distant microphone . and it 's perfectly synchronized , so . and the sentence contain only one word , which is `` due `` and it ca n't clearly be seen . where where is it ? professor a : uh - huh . phd f : where is the word ? phd b : this is this is , oh , a plot of c - zero , the energy . phd f : this is a plot of c - zero , uh when we do n't use spectral substraction , and when there is no on - line normalization . professor a : mm - hmm . phd f : so . there is just some filtering with the lda and and some downsampling , upsampling . phd b : c - zero is the close talking ? uh the close channel ? phd f : yeah . yeah . phd b : and s channel one is the phd f : yeah . so c - zero is very clean , actually . phd b : yeah . phd f : uh then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure , though it is not . which is good . well , the noise part is around zero professor a : mm - hmm . phd f : and and then the third figure is what happens when we apply mean normalization and variance normalization . so . what we can clearly see is that on the speech portion the two channel come becomes very close , but also what happens on the noisy portion is that the variance of the noise is professor a : mm - hmm . phd b : this is still being a plot of c - zero ? ok . phd f : yeah . this is still c - zero . phd b : can i ask um what does variance normalization do ? w what is the effect of that ? professor a : normalizes the variance ."
