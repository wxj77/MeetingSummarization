    "answer": "project manager : alright . and we 'll turn to the next presentation . i think she said we do n't need to screw it in , just stick it in . and then press , what ? f f_n_ and f_ eight . next to the control button on the bottom , and then f_ eight at the top . user interface : yeah , press them . project manager : and then w be patient . user interface : yeah , here we go . project manager : tada . industrial designer : and if you want it to go into slide show mode , it 's that little button there . user interface : can i not just uh do each one in order ? industrial designer : i you can if you like , it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p project manager : there we are . yay . user interface : that ? industrial designer : no that one , that one there . user interface : that ? industrial designer : left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep . user interface : that ? right , technical functions design . uh well i think first off , basically i do agree with what sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences , yeah . i think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . so my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . and what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . if we can build on this with the speech recognition , that 's not something i 'd thought about at all , but it 's also something we can discuss . project manager : okay . user interface : um and and i presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or d_v_d_ remote control , if this is only gon na be a , you know , satellite , cable , tv remote control . project manager : tv only . user interface : so these are two models of existing remote controls . uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control . project manager : ugh . user interface : it has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . it also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you 'd expect from a , you know , like a sky or cable remote control where you 've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . uh but i think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , i do n't think we need them at all . i think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and i think an an enter function where you can access it 's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that 'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . project manager : mm . and exceed the requirements they 're expecting of us . user interface : so it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons project manager : okay . user interface : o i was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access . project manager : alright . user interface : uh but then i do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility . project manager : okay . any uh thing else you wan na add ? okay . user interface : but we could go back to the pictures of the uh , what 're they called ? the pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , marketing : or if user interface : but maybe should hear what kate has to say first . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . let 's hear what kate has to say . user interface : okay then . marketing : maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis . whiteboard session . project manager : i think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : definitely less cluttered and i mean but still it 's project manager : it 's there but it 's user interface : i was just i 'll just uh resume something else i was gon na say . marketing : user interface : the the style of these is terrible . project manager : yeah . user interface : i i i really think we need to uh not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . marketing : the ergonomics , the way it fits in your yeah . user interface : but so that 's that for now . industrial designer : cheers . mm , i have n't actually got a display on my screen . project manager : okay . industrial designer : still , i 'll do without that . okay um , now i wan na bring us down to earth again i 'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . um oh and this is the methodology i used in preparing for this meeting . um basically i 've been doing a little bit of web-based research , and if i had a design team , i would 've been discussing my ideas with 'em . but the the net result is that i 've come up with a first cut for the working design that i 'd like to discuss with you . so , let 's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . it 's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . and the the basic components we 've got to build in for our twelve euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . now i would have hoped i think that 's my only slide actually , yeah . i would have have hoped to um do you a pretty powerpoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you 'll bear with me i 'll do it on the whiteboard . so we want an energy source which is there . and we 've got to think about what that might be . project manager : hmm-mm . industrial designer : uh we obviously do n't want wires on this thing . uh typically it would be a battery , but i 'm open to suggestions . um and then we have the the user interface . oops . and the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . so those are the basic things that we 've got to get in for our twelve euros fifty . thank you . project manager : hmm . okay . right . but those things as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what what does it look like ? what do the buttons look like ? uh what does it feel like ? that 's where the user interface is really coming into its own . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : the technical end is what 's actually gon na be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . for example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? um is there any um because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for d_v_d_s , movies , whatever . um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? industrial designer : well i may be wrong here , but i 'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . we 're trying to sell four million of 'em , um that 's that 's , you know , that 's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . um and i had n't thought of it as being a reparable thing , project manager : okay . industrial designer : you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that 's why i 'm a bit concerned . i like the idea of speech recognition , that 's a great idea , but i 'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gon na need to hit . project manager : okay . user interface : whoop . marketing : do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? user interface : is n't that your job ? marketing : because then project manager : oh . industrial designer : user interface : oh right . marketing : the chip composer marketing . oh no , the chip composer sender . project manager : mm . what they cost . industrial designer : um , i 'm i 'm i 'm hoping that my personal coach is gon na give me some advice on that , if you 're asking me , marketing : i i do n't believe i know , um . project manager : okay . marketing : okay . industrial designer : but marketing : be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : it does it does seem as if we 're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the which is pretty much the same as these existing models , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : just maybe a little bit more inspired , marketing : inspired ? user interface : but basically just the same . although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two a_a_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an m_p_ three player does ? with that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : you could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it 's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you do n't have to worry with replacing a_a_ batteries , which are marketing : that has another element , which is if every time you 're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place . user interface : you 'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah . marketing : yeah , but it also has a place , user interface : and it 's not stuck down the back of the sofa . marketing : so exactly . user interface : but then again i d i do n't know if this is within our price range or not . marketing : that 's a really good idea . industrial designer : well i uh think that 's a very interesting idea , but um i 'm not a very good industrial designer and i do n't know much about what these things cost . i 'll do some research for the next meeting . project manager : okay . user interface : marketing : well it 's better than my idea about solar , probably . project manager : uh yeah . industrial designer : well solar may not be so good when you 're watching tv in the night , marketing : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : but user interface : well it is just so annoying how project manager : it would have to sor store up the energy marketing : mm . yeah . industrial designer : yeah , i guess . project manager : and then use it . solar can do that . industrial designer : we may be talking quite heavy then . project manager : m yeah , that would be too heavy marketing : yeah . project manager : and it 'd cost too much . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : no , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably i mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , marketing : mm-hmm user interface : but for long-term use it 'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky a_a_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? user interface : you know f marketing : definitely , 'cause i 'm thinking in terms of um uh the loss and breakage of um remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home , a um a nest , a place to live , user interface : sort of have its little dock that you could put it in . industrial designer : marketing : exactly . project manager : yeah . marketing : so if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is project manager : and the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . marketing : exactly . user interface : still i do n't know if it 's quite within our price range . marketing : mm . 'cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware . user interface : yeah ."
