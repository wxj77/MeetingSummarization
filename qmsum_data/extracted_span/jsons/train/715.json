    "answer": "project manager : okay . oh , that 's not gon na work . oh , alright . okay . okay . um alright . marketing : uh , uh , um . project manager : i 'll just put that there . uh as you all know we 're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . uh i 'm nick debusk , i 'm the project manager . uh we 'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you 're doing , what your what your role is um . go ahead . marketing : okay . i am corinne whiting and i will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases i will have a different role . in the function design phase i will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i 'll be doing research to figure this out . in the conceptual design phase i will be dealing with trend watching and i 'll be doing marketing research on the web . and then finally in the um detailed design phase i will be doing product evaluation and so i will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . project manager : 'kay . user interface : hiya , i 'm ryan . um i 'm the user interface designer . um likewise i 've three different roles for each stage of design . um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . and the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we 're gon na make it special . that 's about it . industrial designer : right . i 'm manuel and i 'm the industrial designer in in this project um . in the functional design phase i 'm i 'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we 'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . um i suppose we 'll work pretty much together on that one . um um in the conceptual design um i 'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and uh the detailed design in the detailed design i 'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we 're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . okay . project manager : okay . um so we 've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we 've kinda done . uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . user interface : marketing : project manager : uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . um so we are putting together a new remote control . um we want it to be something original . um of course we 're a not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use . um we 've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . and w uh well um functional design um . um do we have um any ideas of of maybe d let 's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we 're gon na design it and and how we 're gon na do the detailing on it . user interface : yeah . well uh s function of remote control is just just you know , change channels is its main function . project manager : so we want it to be um a tv remote or i i mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? user interface : oh right . i suppose you c try make it a universal remote project manager : 'kay . user interface : for could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person 's house . but , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . industrial designer : project manager : mm-hmm . 'kay . user interface : i think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like i do n't actually know . but is it just infra-red ? is that standard ? project manager : i i think yeah , yeah , r universal remote . user interface : ye yeah . project manager : um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , marketing : huh . project manager : so marketing : ours too . user interface : project manager : i think we 're all in the same boat here . um user interface : um one thing i thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . project manager : okay . user interface : so if there 's a g a way of finding it quite easily , i thought that 'd be quite good quite a good feature . marketing : mm . ch project manager : so we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh marketing : like a tracking device ? project manager : like a tracking device or or like a a user interface : oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise project manager : it makes a noise , user interface : and it 'd beep . project manager : there 's a button on the tv that you press industrial designer : mm , mm . project manager : and user interface : yeah . industrial designer : right . project manager : 'kay . marketing : be good . industrial designer : so user interface : generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . project manager : yeah . do we want user interface : just long . project manager : so they 're kinda like long and rectangular . user interface : yeah . project manager : do we want something crazy ? user interface : black usually . project manager : you know , we want something new that 's gon na stand out . user interface : yeah . marketing : lot more modern . project manager : a m a modern so our remote should be user interface : i think so . maybe sorta spherical or something . a ball . industrial designer : marketing : maybe like user-friendly , like a little user interface : yeah . marketing : you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . user interface : people i thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball , project manager : 'kay . user interface : and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . industrial designer : well there are of course certain restrictions , you ca n't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here . um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . what are we gon na build that thing out of ? how sturdy is it gon na be ? do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? project manager : okay so yeah , so we want it to be sturdy , user interface : yeah . project manager : we want it to to hold up to somebody 's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , user interface : yeah . project manager : then it user interface : it could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside . project manager : 'kay . um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , um so our form and our function . um we want it to be um easy to find . um what else it what else do we want it to to do ? so we want it to be universal . it 's something that we 're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros um and you know , goals for profits are i think somewhere around uh fifty million euros , what they wan na make on it , so . marketing : mm . also since we 're partners of the international remote control association , maybe we wan na make it something that would globally appeal . project manager : 'kay . marketing : that 's more on the research end , but the marketing . project manager : so marketing , you know , how maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : and maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , project manager : 'kay . marketing : 'cause maybe one wo n't apply to all of the countries we 're targeting . user interface : ye small . industrial designer : right . project manager : um do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . some ideas ? we want it to be a b a ball , user interface : i 'd i could draw sorta the ball idea . project manager : you know , we 'll draw up we 'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located . user interface : my original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you this is where it 's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle maybe a hinge that 'll have to be the strongest part of it . if that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , industrial designer : user interface : and then you 'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . thing is inside i think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . um , i dunno , what 's the idea for . just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . it 's looking a bit like something out of star wars at the moment though , to be fair . marketing : project manager : user interface : but yeah . marketing : futuristic . industrial designer : user interface : that was that was a sorta simple idea i had project manager : uh-huh . user interface : and then you know you could about right , it would almost be like a ball . so that was just just an idea i had . i do n't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? industrial designer : right . one problem you 'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it 's stability really , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but of course , since it 's a ball , it 'll roll , so we 'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , user interface : yeah . maybe f yeah . industrial designer : take away that part . that 's one of the big issues . also also you risk the hinges here . that 's that 's um a problem . user interface : yeah , that 's g that 's a good idea . yeah . the idea it did n't have to necessarily be f a hinge , industrial designer : that 's that 's interesting of course , user interface : that was just one idea though . industrial designer : but that 's of course a weak point , yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : project manager : how would we go about um making you know getting rid of our weak points ? what i mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? user interface : marketing : project manager : not to put you on the spot , industrial designer : e no no , project manager : but industrial designer : uh uh . project manager : what did you say your title was again ? marketing : project manager : you 're the the industrial designer . industrial designer : uh , i 'm your industrial designer , marketing : industrial designer : so i b well , project manager : industrial designer : the point is that well maybe i dunno . the shape is perhaps not the most ideal . project manager : okay . industrial designer : as as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . user interface : well i i suppose that things become design . but i mean i marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i was trying to think of like the design of others . i ca n't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , project manager : yeah . user interface : maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there 's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . project manager : it 's not new , it 's not innovative , it 's you know , everybody does long remote because it 's easy , user interface : yeah . project manager : it 's it 's stable um . marketing : 'kay , i 'll draw something . project manager : so if marketing : what ? project manager : no , go ahead . marketing : my idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games user interface : yeah . marketing : l so . but maybe i mean that would be kinda big and bulky . we could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . i do n't know . that 's my idea . user interface : i think definitely doing something different marketing : yeah . user interface : is a good idea . i mean maybe design something , that 's sort of like suppose not everybody 's everybody 's hand 's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . project manager : something with a grip . marketing : mm . yeah . user interface : yeah , with a grip . project manager : yeah . because even i suppose even with the ball user interface : it still might be hard to project manager : it 's user interface : it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . project manager : it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . so perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . user interface : like yeah . project manager : but then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we user interface : yeah . marketing : true . user interface : it 's d yeah . i think it 's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . project manager : i feel like i 'm just shooting everything down here . user interface : marketing : that 's fine . project manager : uh um marketing : you 're the boss , you 're allowed to . industrial designer : well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . so if the remote is too small it marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : if it 's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . so for that there 's project manager : okay , so industrial designer : so project manager : unfortunately we 've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . um we 've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we 've got a couple ideas um . let 's see here . what if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . so you know um s so it 's easier to hold onto that way . user interface : yeah . project manager : course that 'll then remove some of our our ball . unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . so the grip is no , that would n't work either um . but if we 're gon na make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here i guess , um and then flat uh and then we have the problem with the hinge . so if we 're flat on the bottom , it 's not gon na roll away , it 'll stay where we want . industrial designer : the question is also , i dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? project manager : mm , that 's true . industrial designer : it 's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so i do n't know if a lid is a good idea . from stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . so it 's do n't make it too stable uh . project manager : so we do n't have it flip open . we just have a ball user interface : but then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . industrial designer : to the other design . project manager : okay , so then we forget the ball . industrial designer : it looks cool . marketing : looks cool though . project manager : it looks cool , but it 's really not it 's not functional um . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : uh functional . project manager : so we 've got our sort of keyboard kind . what if we flipped it around here , so that it were um sorry , that does n't look anything like what you had there . um so it 's up and down , you hold it this way . user interface : yeah . project manager : course then it 's it 's like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . marketing : industrial designer : right . right . project manager : but it 's one-handed um . industrial designer : question is what makes those game pads functional ? w i think that 's pretty much the form for full hand . so it 's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : right , makes it nice , so that 's the essential part . except for that i think we 'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design . project manager : yeah . marketing : right . industrial designer : 'cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : you know , all project manager : because it does n't have a cord , like joysticks do . industrial designer : that dif batteries right , and batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wan na control with it , right ? so , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . project manager : is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? so that either way you 're pointing it it would work . industrial designer : i suppose you could do that . o of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it 'll cost , so . project manager : more expensive and yeah . industrial designer : course you can do that . project manager : 'kay . um industrial designer : i mean of course it 'll be evident after a while or if you look at it , it 'll it 'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff , project manager : true . industrial designer : but um it 's rather about an instinctual thing , user interface : put it industrial designer : like you just grab it , you do n't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work . user interface : even if you designed it in some in a way that you know , is n't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . so if that 's your thing and you got something like that instead , marketing : yeah . user interface : and there 's your s you kn you know which way you 're gon na pointing it . project manager : 'kay . user interface : um marketing : sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish . project manager : are we out of time ? marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some are good ideas , what are not . industrial designer : let 's . user interface : does it say what does it say for n industrial designer : obviously user interface : it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , i think . project manager : uh . must finish now , so . and then marketing will look and see what uh what people want . industrial designer : alright . marketing : great . project manager : okay . and project manager will design a better meeting for next time around , be a little bit more prepared . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : and uh alright , good meeting ."
