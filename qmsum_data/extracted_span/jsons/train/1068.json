    "answer": "marketing : oh . come on . right . okay . . okay . well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . so seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . okay , so they do n't like the look of the remote control . um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . so i think we all agree with that . um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . so , they do n't like like the way they operate it does n't like match how people behave . um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably do n't use those , they only use the up and down channel . project manager : 'cause we 've only got five channels . marketing : exactly . industrial designer : marketing : that 's another thing . um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like . project manager : i think that 's k flicking quickly between channels . user interface : yeah , you wan na navigate the channels quickly i guess . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : mm . um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . i think especially for uh the older generation . i know my grandmother does n't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . so maybe tracking devices is a good idea . project manager : wow . marketing : um personal preferences . project manager : you are a child of technology , are n't you ? marketing : um so yeah um i was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . um has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . and it 's easy to find , so i do n't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they 'd be interested in um voice activating . industrial designer : marketing : so voice activation . so and this was what we came up with . then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , sorry , age groups . so fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . project manager : so there you go , yeah . marketing : um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason did n't want a voice activated one . and neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . industrial designer : project manager : uh but do the younger generation have the money ? they they do n't . user interface : no i would i would say the older the older people , yeah . project manager : it 's older generation , they 're the ones that have gone out and marketing : well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so project manager : people people from the age of thirty f there 's a big drop off there . marketing : project manager : for people up to the age of thirty five , you 're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . um but no they 're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , user interface : yeah , that would be my guess as well . project manager : uh 'cause they 're the ones that have been working for twenty years . marketing : so they do n't project manager : um d and tha marketing : well project manager : and that 's a that 's quite a minority there , so yeah , it 's not even like fifty fifty that 's th thirty five per cent . marketing : these guys are growing up . user interface : what about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? i mean if if it 's twelve fifty per unit . project manager : yeah . user interface : i mean , okay , there 's marketing : voice activation might not be the best . project manager : i would say scra i 'd say scrap that straight off . marketing : um also with um with buttons , a thing called r_s_i_ , so wrist sense user interface : repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing marketing : yeah , repetitive strains injury , so they do n't i think people who watch tv maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . industrial designer : well maybe they should n't watch so much tv then . marketing : i do n't think so . project manager : so y so it 's so it 's so you got user interface : project manager : so that 's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of marketing : yeah maybe not so hard . project manager : see have a look if um there 's any w any medical background we can find out about this . industrial designer : maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a marketing : yeah . project manager : let 's jus marketing : maybe project manager : we just want need to cover our arses so that people are n't gon na sue us in ten years ' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . user interface : yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh . project manager : yeah . they 're having a lunch break at the moment , but yeah . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : i 'll see if i can get see if i can get hold of them for the next meeting . user interface : yeah . i think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . project manager : yeah . marketing : mm . maybe th the buttons not so high up so you do n't have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something . yeah . project manager : okay ."
