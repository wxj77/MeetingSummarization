    "answer": "grad a : right . right . i mean , so we 're we 're collecting a corpus and i think it 's gon na be generally useful . i mean , it seems like it 's not a corpus which is uh , has been done before . and so i think people will be interested in having having it , and so we will undergrad d : u using , like , audio d v ds or something like that ? grad a : excuse me ? undergrad d : audio d v grad a : well , or something . yeah , audio d v c ds , you know . undergrad d : yeah . tapes . grad a : and and so how we do we distribute the transcripts , how do we distribute the audio files , how do we how do we just do all that infrastructure ? phd c : well , i think i mean , for that particular issue ther there are known sources where people go to to find these kind of things like the ldc for instance . postdoc e : yeah , grad a : right , but but so should we do it in the same format as ldc postdoc e : that 's right . grad a : and what does that mean to what we 've done already ? phd b : right . the it 's not so much the actu the logistics of distribution are secondary to preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution . phd c : right . grad a : right . so , uh , as it is , it 's sort of a ad - hoc combination of stuff dan set and stuff i set up , which we may wan na make a little more formal . so . phd b : and the other thing is that , um , university of washington may want to start recording meetings as well , grad a : right . phd b : in which case w w we 'll have to decide what we 've actually got so that we can give them a copy . grad a : that 's right . undergrad d : a field trip . grad a : yeah . i was actually thinking i would n't mind spending the summer up there . that would be kind of fun . phd b : oh , really ? grad a : yeah . visit my friends and spend some time phd b : different for you . yes . grad a : well , and then also i have a bunch of stuff for doing this digits . so i have a bunch of scripts with x waves , and some perl scripts , and other things that make it really easy to extract out and align where the digits are . and if u d uw 's going to do the same thing i think it 's worth while for them to do these digits tasks as well . undergrad d : mm - hmm . grad a : and what i 've done is pretty ad - hoc , um , so we might wan na change it over to something a little more standard . you know , stm files , or xml , or something ."
