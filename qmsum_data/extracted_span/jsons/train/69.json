    "answer": "phd d : the feature the input ? the inputs are the fifteen the fifteen uh bases feature . professor c : uh - huh . phd d : the with the new code . and the other three features are r , the variance of the difference between the two spectrum , professor c : uh - huh . phd d : the variance of the auto - correlation function , except the the first point , because half the height value is r - zero professor c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd d : and also r - zero , the first coefficient of the auto - correlation function . that is like the energy with these three feature , professor c : right . phd d : also these three feature . professor c : you would n't do like r - one over r - zero or something like that ? i mean usually for voiced - unvoiced you 'd do yeah , you 'd do something you 'd do energy phd d : yeah . professor c : but then you have something like spectral slope , which is you get like r - one ov over r - zero or something like that . phd d : uh yeah . phd e : what are the r 's ? professor c : r correlations . phd e : i 'm sorry i missed it . phd d : no , r c no . auto - correlation ? yes , yes , the variance of the auto - correlation function that uses that professor c : ye - well that 's the variance , but if you just say `` what is `` i mean , to first order , um yeah one of the differences between voiced , unvoiced and silence is energy . another one is but the other one is the spectral shape . phd d : yeah , i i 'll the spectral shape , professor c : yeah , and so r - one over r - zero is what you typically use for that . phd d : yeah . no , i do n't use that i ca n't use professor c : no , i 'm saying that 's what people us typically use . see , because it because this is this is just like a single number to tell you um `` does the spectrum look like that or does it look like that `` . phd d : mm - hmm . grad a : oh . r r r - zero . professor c : right ? phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : so if it 's if it 's um if it 's low energy uh but the but the spectrum looks like that or like that , it 's probably silence . phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : uh but if it 's low energy and the spectrum looks like that , it 's probably unvoiced . phd d : yeah . professor c : so if you just if you just had to pick two features to determine voiced - unvoiced , you 'd pick something about the spectrum like uh r - one over r - zero , um and r - zero phd d : mm - hmm , ok . professor c : or i i you know you 'd have some other energy measure and like in the old days people did like uh zero crossing counts . phd d : yeah , yeah . professor c : right . s s phd d : well , i can also th use this . professor c : yeah . um , phd d : bec - because the result are a little bit better but we have in a point that everything is more or less the similar more or less similar . professor c : yeah . but um"
