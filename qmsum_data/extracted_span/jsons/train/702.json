    "query": "<s> what did phd a think about vad ?",
    "answer": "phd a : but i guess perhaps i do n't know w yeah . uh , yeah . per - e s s someone told that perhaps it 's not fair to do that because the , um to make a good vad you do n't have enough to with the the features that are the baseline features . so mmm , you need more features . so you really need to put more more in the in in the front - end . professor b : yeah . sure . but i bu phd c : wait a minute . i i 'm confused . phd a : yeah . phd c : wha - what do you mean ? phd a : yeah , if i professor b : so y so you m s yeah , but well , let 's say for ins see , mfcc for instance does n't have anything in it , uh , related to the pitch . so just just for example . so suppose you 've that what you really wan na do is put a good pitch detector on there and if it gets an unambiguous phd c : oh , oh . i see . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : if it gets an unambiguous result then you 're definitely in a in a in a voice in a , uh , s region with speech . uh . phd c : so there 's this assumption that the v the voice activity detector can only use the mfcc ? phd a : that 's not clear , but this e professor b : well , for the baseline . phd c : yeah . professor b : so so if you use other features then y but it 's just a question of what is your baseline . right ? what is it that you 're supposed to do better than ? phd c : i g yeah . professor b : and so having the baseline be the mfcc 's means that people could choose to pour their ener their effort into trying to do a really good vad phd c : i do n't s but they seem like two separate issues . professor b : or tryi they 're sort of separate . phd c : right ? i mean professor b : unfortunately there 's coupling between them , which is part of what i think stephane is getting to , is that you can choose your features in such a way as to improve the vad . phd a : yeah . professor b : and you also can choose your features in such a way as to prove improve recognition . they may not be the same thing . phd c : but it seems like you should do both . professor b : you should do both phd c : right ? professor b : and and i i think that this still makes i still think this makes sense as a baseline . it 's just saying , as a baseline , we know you know , we had the mfcc 's before , lots of people have done voice activity detectors , phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : you might as well pick some voice activity detector and make that the baseline , just like you picked some version of htk and made that the baseline . phd a : yeah . right . professor b : and then let 's try and make everything better . um , and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features be better features for the vad then that 's so be it . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : but , uh , uh , uh , at least you have a starting point that 's um , cuz i i some of the some of the people did n't have a vad at all , i guess . right ? and and phd a : yeah . professor b : then they they looked pretty bad and and in fact what they were doing was n't so bad at all . phd a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : but , um . phd c : yeah . it seems like you should try to make your baseline as good as possible . and if it turns out that you ca n't improve on that , well , i mean , then , you know , nobody wins and you just use mfcc . right ? professor b : yeah . i mean , it seems like , uh , it should include sort of the current state of the art that you want are trying to improve , and mfcc 's , you know , or plp or something it seems like reasonable baseline for the features , and anybody doing this task , uh , is gon na have some sort of voice activity detection at some level , in some way . they might use the whole recognizer to do it but rather than a separate thing , but but they 'll have it on some level . so , um . phd c : it seems like whatever they choose they should n't , you know , purposefully brain - damage a part of the system to make a worse baseline , or professor b : well , i think people just had phd c : you know ? professor b : it was n't that they purposely brain - damaged it . i think people had n't really thought through about the , uh the vad issue . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : and and then when the the the proposals actually came in and half of them had v a ds and half of them did n't , and the half that did did well and the half that did n't did poorly . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : so it 's phd a : mm - hmm . um . yeah . so we 'll see what happen with this . and yeah . so what happened since , um , last week is well , from ogi , these experiments on putting vad on the baseline . and these experiments also are using , uh , some kind of noise compensation , so spectral subtraction , and putting on - line normalization , um , just after this . so i think spectral subtraction , lda filtering , and on - line normalization , so which is similar to the pro proposal - one , but with spectral subtraction in addition , and it seems that on - line normalization does n't help further when you have spectral subtraction . phd c : is this related to the issue that you brought up a couple of meetings ago with the the musical tones phd a : i phd c : and ? phd a : i have no idea , because the issue i brought up was with a very simple spectral subtraction approach , and the one that they use at ogi is one from from the proposed the the the aurora prop uh , proposals , which might be much better . so , yeah . i asked sunil for more information about that , but , uh , i do n't know yet . um . and what 's happened here is that we so we have this kind of new , um , reference system which use a nice a a clean downsampling - upsampling , which use a new filter that 's much shorter and which also cuts the frequency below sixty - four hertz , professor b : right . phd a : which was not done on our first proposal . professor b : when you say `` we have that `` , does sunil have it now , too , phd a : i no . professor b : or ? phd a : because we 're still testing . so we have the result for , uh , just the features and we are currently testing with putting the neural network in the klt . um , it seems to improve on the well - matched case , um , but it 's a little bit worse on the mismatch and highly - mismatched i mean when we put the neural network . and with the current weighting i think it 's sh it will be better because the well - matched case is better . mmm . professor b : but how much worse since the weighting might change how how much worse is it on the other conditions , when you say it 's a little worse ? phd a : it 's like , uh , fff , fff { comment } um , { comment } ten percent relative . yeah . professor b : ok . um . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : but it has the , uh the latencies are much shorter . that 's phd a : uh - y w when i say it 's worse , it 's not it 's when i i uh , compare proposal - two to proposal - one , so , r uh , y putting neural network compared to n not having any neural network . i mean , this new system is is is better , professor b : uh - huh . phd a : because it has um , this sixty - four hertz cut - off , uh , clean downsampling , and , um what else ? uh , yeah , a good vad . we put the good vad . so . yeah , i do n't know . i i j uh , uh pr professor b : but the latencies but you 've got the latency shorter now . phd a : latency is short is yeah . professor b : yeah . phd f : is n't it phd a : and so professor b : so it 's better than the system that we had before . phd a : yeah . mainly because of the sixty - four hertz and the good vad . and then i took this system and , mmm , w uh , i p we put the old filters also . so we have this good system , with good vad , with the short filter and with the long filter , and , um , with the short filter it 's not worse . so well , is it it 's in professor b : so that 's that 's all fine . phd a : yes . uh professor b : but what you 're saying is that when you do these so let me try to understand . when when you do these same improvements to proposal - one , phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : that , uh , on the i things are somewhat better , uh , in proposal - two for the well - matched case and somewhat worse for the other two cases . phd a : yeah . professor b : so does , uh when you say , uh so the th now that these other things are in there , is it the case maybe that the additions of proposal - two over proposal - one are less im important ? phd a : yeah . probably , yeah . professor b : i get it ."
