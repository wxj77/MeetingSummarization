    "query": "<s> what did user interface think about the design of the remote control when discussing the user interface concept ?",
    "answer": "user interface : uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . uh i 've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel , which well , i could n't find a the picture of the ipod w only linked to a web browser , so i could n't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . it has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse . so i was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . like i guess an existing sky or cable one does . like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what 's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it 'll show you what 's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up marketing : user interface : and you can see what 's on the other channels while you 're watching the same channel on the screen . uh but i 'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . so project manager : user interface : what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , i mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , i was thinking , yellow and black , just because that 's the company 's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . and when you 've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , it does n't obscure much of the actual picture you 're watching . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down ."
