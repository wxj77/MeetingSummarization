    "answer": "lynne neagle am : thank you . we 're going to move on to explore some of the issues around social services now with questions from dawn bowden . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . morning , minister . when the association of directors of social services cymru came in , they were saying to us that they would encourage people to report any instances , anything that they see around somebody smacking a child . that leads on to the question about whether in fact social services , then , would change their thresholds for intervention if there were more cases being referred to them . are you fairly confident , are you certain , that that would n't happen , or do you think there is a danger that social services might actually say , 'well , actually , if we 're getting all these referrals , we need to think again about when and if we intervene ' , and the thresholds could become a bit lower ? julie morgan am : well , as you know , social services already receive and investigate reports of children being physically punished\u2014any sort of range of physical punishment\u2014and they use standard procedures to determine how to proceed , but that 's done on a case-by-case basis ; it 's made on the individual case element . and , of course , there is a distinction between reasonable punishment and child neglect or abuse . and if this legislation is enacted , a significant proportion of the incidents of physical punishment will not require any response under the child protection procedures , and we do not expect the threshold of significant harm to change . and i know you took evidence from the adss , and i know sally jenkins gave evidence , who is one of the lead practitioners , and i understood she said : 'in terms of thresholds for children 's services , we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us . there may be a small number of referrals that come through . what we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle . we recognise that 's likely to happen . ' so , i think\u2014 dawn bowden am : so , it 's the threshold for intervention that 's the key , really , is n't it , rather than\u2014 ? julie morgan am : yes , they do n't see that changing . dawn bowden am : so , they do n't see that changing . julie morgan am : no , no . and we do n't see that changing . dawn bowden am : okay , that 's fine . the police , when they came in to give evidence , talked about the need for the multi-agency safeguarding hubs . and what we also heard is that it 's a bit inconsistent across the country . and i think you acknowledged that as well . do you think the implementation of the bill , and its effectiveness , is going to be dependent on us having consistently effective multi-agency safeguarding hubs right the way across the country ? julie morgan am : no . the effective implementation of the bill does not depend on mashs , as we call them for short , because bodies , social services , already work closely with the police on a day-to-day basis , really , and they have indicated their willingness to do so , and there are already well-established mechanisms in place that enable this joint working to take place . i know that the mashs are only in certain areas , and i know that it's\u2014 . i think they 're probably very good to have , actually , and very good to help the work , but it 's certainly not dependent on them . dawn bowden am : okay , but it would be something that you would be wanting to see developed , that eventually we would have these mashs right across the country ? julie morgan am : at the moment , there are three mashs in the south wales police force , and one pilot mash in the gwent police force , but they do n't operate in exactly the same way . and i know that other areas have considered having mashs , but have n't actually brought any in . and a multi-agency strategic group , which is led by south wales police , has been set up , and it will consider the effectiveness of mash arrangements in wales , so it 's very possible there will be more mashs , but i want to reiterate that we 're not dependent on mashs in order to have the close working . but they 're welcome\u2014very welcome . dawn bowden am : yes , because the key point from the police 's point of view , i think , was that they provide a single point of contact , so it 's very simple , is n't it ? it 's a single point of contact , and i think they were quite concerned that having that single point of contact might actually reduce the level of unnecessary police prosecutions\u2014well , the police do n't prosecute , but charges and so on . so , it was just a point that they were raising . julie morgan am : i think they are very effective and very much to be welcomed , but it 's certainly not essential . dawn bowden am : sorry , karen ."
