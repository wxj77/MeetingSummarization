    "answer": "marketing : hello . project manager : . . marketing : yes , i made it . english from now on . industrial designer : . marketing : drawing or project manager : yeah just testing . marketing : yeah . project manager : mm ? english . industrial designer : just kidding . project manager : . industrial designer : so annoying . project manager : break is over . marketing : ooh it works . project manager : whoo . marketing : spicy . project manager : spicy . marketing : where are are all the other presentations ? industrial designer : i just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be marketing : the conceptual or industrial designer : yeah i think so . yeah , conceptual design . what or whatever does it marketing : ah . because i see only my own presentation user interface : industrial designer : no no no , can you go back one ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : uh 'cause it has to be powerpoint pre yeah components design , that 's it . marketing : this ? i 'll just put it in there . project manager : so , he 's coming . industrial designer : . i did get a bit more done than the last time , marketing : or not . user interface : okay . project manager : oh okay . industrial designer : 'cause i knew that i did n't have time so i just copy and paste everything into the user interface : project manager : ah . she . marketing : i ca n't cut and paste it into the other folder but project manager : you can look at the final report , 'cause i have to record everything we are deciding and such , so i 'm trying to write it down between everything else . marketing : move to meeting room . industrial designer : sometimes i have these pop-ups or these sounds and there 's nothing there , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and also with i do n't know how to use powerpoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it . marketing : yeah me too , . user interface : i i 've got the same problem as well . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : here we go again . welcome . uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f the remote control has to support . so who wants go . industrial designer : mm-hmm . who wants to start ? marketing : me first again or project manager : yeah sure . does n't matter . user interface : oh . no . yeah . no problem marketing : yeah . alright . did you open it already or no . ah . ah . yes . so welcome to the marketing presentation once again . um this time about trendwatching . uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . uh it shows a number of developments . uh i will address them uh in a moment . um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that 's our public . um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . and the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . so um the developments i will address them project manager : marketing : oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . so to give you an idea . um well the developments ? uh development one . uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . and the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . i think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , industrial designer : sound . yeah yeah uh uh . marketing : so i do n't expect that to be a problem . and the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . um well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect , w which was twice as important as the third aspect . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so um that kind of gets you this ratios . so fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention . project manager : . marketing : uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . um well technolog technological innovation , we 've covered that pretty much i guess . um and easy to use , i do n't think that will be problem . so my point of attention is especially this part . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that this will be a crux . so that was the marketing uh presentation . i had only one document left . industrial designer : and shall i go first ? user interface : yeah . no . i i do n't mi i do n't mind . industrial designer : so i user interface : that 's project manager : yeah yeah sure . no . marketing : so kind of this user interface : do you want to go first ? okay . industrial designer : yeah ? marketing : so a k a small example . user interface : yeah . marketing : kind of this this look . user interface : marketing : uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours user interface : yeah . marketing : i dunno . just made a quick design . user interface : project manager : cool . yeah you 're just the user interface hmm ? user interface : it 's better than than my uh drawing . industrial designer : alright . marketing : alright . user interface : yeah okay but i have to design the industrial designer : uh components . project manager : yeah layout . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah okay . industrial designer : oh no . marketing : yeah . it 's okay . project manager : you probably opened it . industrial designer : yeah true . um project manager : f_ five . marketing : f_ five . industrial designer : alright . so marketing : industrial designer : i 'm dealing with the components design . um let 's see . i uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . and i used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . that 's why i had to , wanted to go first . well they gave me um an idea about what people want . we 're f mainly focusing on this group , but i want to make the distinction clear . uh i could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so i do n't have examples of how it looks like . but it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type . if you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . so this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . there is a lot of um factors involved in choosing the components . user interface : project manager : industrial designer : there 's a lot of options that we have to discuss . uh for example the energy source . we have four types . the basic battery . uh we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . project manager : industrial designer : which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wan na use the project manager : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and uh of course solar cells . but i dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . marketing : wi an indoors . industrial designer : so uh my project manager : yeah okay . calculator 's can do it . industrial designer : yeah also also in you know countries where there 's n is n't much light like in scandinavia , they would n't be y able to use it half of the year you know . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so that 's not cool either . so um for the uh a case , there 's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . or the double curved . um i was n't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it 's daring and different from what we have now . uh the case materials . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . i would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wan na see nowadays . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um poo , this is a lot of text . i was n't able to organise this yet . we have yeah several uh interface designs . uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . user interface : yeah . pushbuttons . yeah . industrial designer : so that 's not really interesting . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : electronics ? yeah , maybe we wan na decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip i think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . um yeah . i think this is about it . yeah i was working on some per personal preferences . i first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah i 'm traditional and that 's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . but i really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : where you have to move the thing to be able to use it . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : as an optional uh feature . marketing : yeah . user interface : or combine uh both with a with one uh project manager : uh i think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the industrial designer : yeah maybe we marketing : i guess we can only choose one . user interface : okay . industrial designer : i can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . but it is more longlasting , that the people do n't have to ever buy batteries again . marketing : yeah . and it 's more fun . project manager : i did n't receive any info uh . industrial designer : and it 's also more fun yeah . i always chuck my uh remote control around , so marketing : yeah , just playing with it project manager : yeah . marketing : and especially when the material 's rubber . it can be done , i mean , you ca n't harm it , project manager : s yeah it 's safe . user interface : and throw it . industrial designer : yeah y exactly . marketing : so it 's a perfect combination i guess . industrial designer : you do n't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . user interface : marketing : yeah . user interface : okay . industrial designer : so that 's the end of it . user interface : yeah . marketing : so project manager : 'kay next . industrial designer : uh go ahead . marketing : so double curved is like this , this , this , or industrial designer : no it means curved in two dimensions . so uh w single curved ? uh let 's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . and double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . like three d_ . yeah . marketing : yeah . also in in height ? project manager : uh marketing : yeah okay . project manager : okay . can we uh user interface : yeah . one one uh very important thing i was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . we were going to use that . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . so um yeah um yeah that 's one thing uh which i 'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control . project manager : well the visual representation is not there with speech industrial designer : design ? user interface : no okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and project manager : but you can yeah . just yeah . user interface : so okay . project manager : i think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . user interface : yeah . project manager : so i do n't think you have to design anything else for that . user interface : okay . marketing : yeah with the programme . user interface : but do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? project manager : both . user interface : for for everything , project manager : yeah . user interface : also for the advanced options ? okay . uh we have this very uh basic uh trendy design . everybody says it so that 's what 's uh yeah um yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . that 's yeah obvious . um yeah . pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . and only the the lcd panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options . marketing : and and the and the buttons that you need to control it , i guess . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . um yeah design has to be very attractive but that 's your your op your yeah . project manager : user interface : you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout . project manager : yeah . user interface : uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . project manager : that would be the back . user interface : i 'm the back . project manager : back and okay . marketing : yeah . user interface : back and okay yeah . marketing : back and okay . project manager : you did read the minutes i wrote ? user interface : uh project manager : you did read the minutes i wrote ? user interface : what ? a little bit i think but not not everything w industrial designer : i project manager : oh okay 'cause i pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . so user interface : okay . oh i uh did n't read that . project manager : i hate doing work for nothing . user interface : but but this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons . marketing : user interface : um i wanted to to categorise everything . uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes . um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh led light . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . and uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous so that 's an a also an option . um that was it . project manager : that was it ? user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . uh again . ugh . okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? uh energy source , chip type , case type . and user interface . but i did n't see a clear distinction between these so i think what we have is okay . so we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . uh the case would be doubly curved . so industrial designer : and rubber . rubber material . marketing : rubber material . project manager : rubber material . and that 's the only thing we have left . industrial designer : yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function . project manager : oh okay . no it 's easy . marketing : so that 's uh is that is that the advanced chip ? industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : advanced chip . okay . industrial designer : otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . but we need more . marketing : wow . yeah . alright . industrial designer : i 'm just thinking , this is not my department , but i i 'm not sure what this is gon na cost , marketing : kinetic . double curved . project manager : too . industrial designer : to be able to m project manager : uh i did n't get any info on this . so marketing : . industrial designer : so 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five euro a piece . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : that 's gon na be difficult huh ? marketing : the cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? project manager : i have total here . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : project manager : yeah i do n't know . industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah . project manager : i did n't get any information about that so user interface : . we 're going to produce it in uh china so it 's no problem . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : child labour man , we love it . user interface : marketing : yeah , so it 's cheap . project manager : who does n't . uh let 's see . is there a new thing ? marketing : um well the interface type supplements . project manager : yeah the interface , maybe can user interface : uh it 's it 's quite difficult because we we have n't got all the options uh yeah . project manager : ooh . no . uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? and could you put that in the group folder ? of the project folder . industrial designer : um let me see . wait a sec . marketing : if you go to your homepage or something , you should industrial designer : yeah i 'm going there now . marketing : get your own information . industrial designer : inspiration . marketing : i got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there , so project manager : ah you did n't draw it yourself . user interface : industrial designer : well project manager : ah . marketing : too less time . industrial designer : um yeah maybe it 's marketing : yeah , also the menu . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah that that w user interface : this is the the menu i was uh looking uh at . marketing : yeah . yeah i was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow . industrial designer : maybe it 's easier user interface : yeah . project manager : arrow . user interface : arrow yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : so that indicates that there 's an menu under that menu . industrial designer : yeah . yeah perfect . user interface : yeah . marketing : so project manager : . 's the target group . industrial designer : maybe it 's easier if you guys come over here . user interface : s yeah . project manager : yeah sure . industrial designer : s see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know . marketing : oh yeah . industrial designer : it 's like really basic . but this m is more appealing to old people and we do n't want that . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : this is what we 're looking for . and th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions . project manager : oh okay . i see . industrial designer : not only like this but it has to be project manager : yeah also like this . so you can hold it . industrial designer : exactly . it has to be kind of instead of the playstation , the module . it has to be like the the game cube , you know , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . and user interface : but it has also to it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people . project manager : . user interface : th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . so project manager : the children 's story . yeah i 've got it . industrial designer : yeah but that 's that 's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually , project manager : distinction . yeah . industrial designer : 'cause we wan na appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . and user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , user interface : the colour yeah . okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with leds uh beneath the the buttons . industrial designer : you know , with the project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : if you press a button and you can disable the the colour leds for for people that do n't like it . industrial designer : there is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : maybe we should consider this function . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : to customise it and so i mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour project manager : different . mm-hmm . industrial designer : like uh for example this uh photo th camera . project manager : camera . marketing : yeah . cool . s underwater uh project manager : yeah submarine . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : personally i think it 's really ugly . project manager : well user interface : yeah . marketing : industrial designer : just give me the thing that it 's inside there project manager : yeah but this this the is for the . user interface : very cheap uh cheap look . industrial designer : maybe i 'm too old for this stuff . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . uh industrial designer : so those i think are all my marketing : . project manager : ah yeah bright colours . marketing : yeah . also a kind of rubber uh industrial designer : and this is , this is with the curved that i mean . marketing : yeah . project manager : that 's singly curved . industrial designer : yeah . yeah ? project manager : okay . marketing : that should be nice . project manager : well we could make a compromise between that . but i do n't know if it 's worth the effort . industrial designer : a compromise between what ? project manager : uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . so to appeal a little more to the all the public . industrial designer : this , this would be uh single curved uh ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah there 's only in in this dimension . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : like this . so curvy or not . project manager : also . industrial designer : yeah . exactly . exactly . marketing : yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? project manager : yeah that would be an option . i do n't know what you think . industrial designer : i think the marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i mean our aim is to make something different right ? to make something new . marketing : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : i would go for the double curved . project manager : okay . yeah i 'd agree . industrial designer : and i i 'm i 'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so it kind of holds nicely , something like that . user interface : yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . industrial designer : well this is really your decision but marketing : yeah . user interface : if you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you do n't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . industrial designer : yeah . as well . you can make a trigger button or something like that . user interface : yeah . something to shoot at your television industrial designer : yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . user interface : that 's yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : that would be a nice way to use it but i mean , yeah , i 'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand i think . project manager : different . stands out . or oh yeah a one hand uh solution . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so from top view it looks kinda like this . but from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . project manager : can turn it maybe . marketing : maybe because the the screen is on top you can have project manager : to switch from buttons to interface hmm . if you turn it a little . . industrial designer : . marketing : maybe you can c have this kind of shape . a little upwards . so that the screen is more project manager : oh yeah . least you can easily see it . marketing : towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . industrial designer : how about marketing : well well you have it in your hand so it 's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . so then you have double double curved in some way . so this this is so the screen is positioned over here . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : oh . something like that . and the buttons are more , well it 's very thick now but industrial designer : yeah i understand what you mean . marketing : that 's uh that 's industrial designer : how about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop . project manager : if you can uh flip . industrial designer : so that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . marketing : yeah ? that that you can press it and then it comes up ? or industrial designer : and then if you want project manager : uh so you have a the the side view . industrial designer : yeah . something like that . marketing : but then the side view can be straight . if you have a pop-up screen . but i dunno if that 's too expensive . project manager : so and you want to be able to industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i mean maybe it 's too much project manager : make this industrial designer : no uh like project manager : . industrial designer : i would draw it like this . let 's say this is the side view . that you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . if you know what i mean . user interface : okay . yeah . industrial designer : so that it would come up like that . project manager : okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . industrial designer : yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . project manager : yeah . oh yeah . yeah yeah yeah yeah . right . yeah that 's good idea . marketing : oh the advanced buttons . right . user interface : that 's the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : but you you want industrial designer : f for the lcd menu right ? user interface : okay . you just want to hide them all ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so w w project manager : no not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . user interface : the oh . marketing : yeah . project manager : but you can hide the okay and the back uh button . user interface : yeah yeah yeah . project manager : and the menu button also because when you flip it open marketing : yeah . project manager : and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically . industrial designer : oh project manager : industrial designer : activate and th the yeah . marketing : so okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . project manager : why ? you could just make it mechanical . industrial designer : true . true . but you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here . you know a simple uh with a marketing : yeah . yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your user interface : that 's but it 's it 's not industrial designer : yeah . exactly . user interface : it 's not very uh very strong uh yeah if you drop it one time . marketing : true . it uh c it can go open . industrial designer : well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the lcd screen and it wo n't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . project manager : if you cover it with rubber . mm . user interface : okay . marketing : an adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that . industrial designer : and project manager : yeah . so it can bounce . industrial designer : exactly . exactly . we just have to make sure that the closing mechanism wo n't break . marketing : yeah , uh it 's very no it 's very strong . industrial designer : th it 's very solid yeah . project manager : yeah okay so that that may work . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : that actually will offer some extra protection for the project manager : okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : what kind of industrial designer : yeah i was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your th project manager : harder . marketing : yeah the lower part does n't work i guess , so maybe you should try it over there . project manager : . industrial designer : okay . if this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that . with your uh wrist . project manager : industrial designer : that you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . so it 's easier to hold in your hand , to y f user interface : but when you are left-handed , that 's that 's a problem . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : uh yeah . yeah of course . project manager : maybe can design two versions . industrial designer : yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this . marketing : yeah . user interface : but that 's that 's very expensive uh industrial designer : like like you drew here . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : give it project manager : and ergonomical shape . yeah . industrial designer : i would give it a female shape user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but uh yeah . anyway . marketing : yeah . project manager : the female shape yeah . with two uh industrial designer : obviously . make it more appealing to guys . marketing : yeah . user interface : we we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse , with which you can change uh industrial designer : i mean project manager : oh yeah . some uh k esk uh yeah . user interface : and so if you yeah . marketing : yeah but but that 's optional for later i guess . project manager : yeah . user interface : okay . marketing : i mean , we have to make industrial designer : yeah but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape . user interface : some yeah . project manager : yeah yeah . marketing : yeah we we better so choose one industrial designer : and also the screen , you can not mould it . user interface : no no no no . industrial designer : you know kind of thing . marketing : yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but that 's the kind of the idea , industrial designer : and then you can marketing : so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb , industrial designer : you can place the screen here , which can come . marketing : you you can you can use , project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , you can use the button option project manager : so the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? industrial designer : and but then i w i would marketing : spongey . industrial designer : i would do the arrows here , kind of thing . marketing : spongey can be reached by means of industrial designer : those buttons ? and the simple buttons here , user interface : . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so that user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . and and the and the control thngs in the middle ? the the the arrows ? industrial designer : i uh y eah that 's what i mean . user interface : no the arrow 's over here . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the arrows over here , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and here the s simple uh marketing : yeah and then numbers . project manager : buttons . okay . marketing : yeah . alright . project manager : i think that uh it 's a nice design . marketing : uh pretty nice design . yeah . industrial designer : project manager : it 's cool . marketing : yeah it looks uh pretty fancy . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or do we wan na make its shape look like a banana or something ? user interface : industrial designer : i dunno . marketing : . project manager : yeah that 's user interface : marketing : uh bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so it 's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours . industrial designer : yeah we could make marketing : i do n't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? like some soft green or something ? project manager : orange or something . marketing : or and then user interface : or blue ? dark blue or marketing : oh yeah yeah , dark blue industrial designer : we should use marketing : and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , user interface : yeah . marketing : with very uh bright tones i guess . industrial designer : yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . marketing : so you have something like project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the leds on the on the remote control . industrial designer : yeah . yeah okay yeah . user interface : if you we uh yeah . if you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it 's just a neutral colour , project manager : user interface : also for the for the more uh yeah for the people . project manager : huh cool . marketing : mm . that does n't really work . to draw , i guess . project manager : no it 's . marketing : oh . what 's this ? project manager : yeah it 's text . user interface : marketing : right . project manager : n no you have to exit . you could also make line with uh user interface : so that 's marketing : yeah . two hours further . project manager : yeah . marketing : thickness . oh . user interface : so that 's blue . marketing : oh . wh why not go for the twenty ? user interface : project manager : mm . yeah . marketing : yeah . that 's what i call painting . project manager : y marketing : so that 's that 's a dark blue basic colour i guess . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah and then on top of that . marketing : it 's pretty nice . and then uh oh project manager : some yellow . marketing : yeah with some some yellow banana project manager : banana colour . industrial designer : and how about some uh some flashing standby lights ? marketing : like . industrial designer : like you have on the samsung , well i do n't like to call brands phones , marketing : industrial designer : the you know that 'cause i remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often . marketing : yeah ? industrial designer : so it not not only in in the colours of the leds , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or marketing : how do you mean ? project manager : yeah if you if flashing colour so you ca n't lose it , basically . industrial designer : um user interface : yeah . marketing : some some industrial designer : yeah . exactly . project manager : well i think it 's a bit too much but user interface : maybe a industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah an orange . well alright well this is more like purple i guess , project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : but it 's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so uh yeah . that would be a nice uh nice device i guess . user interface : and which which colour should uh should i give the the display ? uh or marketing : i mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : ah well i do n't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive . project manager : and then you can use yellow or semething . why not ? aye . user interface : yeah . marketing : so just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that . user interface : mm . yeah . marketing : green is too old-fashioned . but blue , blue 's okay . j industrial designer : as long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . project manager : like this . user interface : maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? industrial designer : so that people with uh with marketing : white backlight , and dark . user interface : dark uh letters , yeah . marketing : yeah . whatever which is visible . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : i know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . i mean it 's hard to tell uh i dunno . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and also for people who are a bit colourblind . project manager : colourblind yeah . marketing : yeah . true . project manager : no so that 's mostly red and green i believe . marketing : which which uh colour should the buttons be ? user interface : that 's adjustable . project manager : woah . all all buttons ? marketing : why adjustable ? user interface : yeah ? or not . project manager : okay . marketing : no uh user interface : that 's how we are going to make it uh more trendy . or is it uh too expensive ? marketing : but maybe i mean they have to they have to have some colour right ? project manager : it 's difficult . marketing : and if the background is very dark blue project manager : blue . maybe green . industrial designer : but do n't we wan na make the background the the bright colo colours ? so th the total of the thing is very bright ? project manager : yeah you can industrial designer : like the pictures i showed you guys . those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy . marketing : yeah ? project manager : mm-hmm flashy . marketing : so more like project manager : mm bzz . marketing : does n't work very well . uh . more like this colour . industrial designer : yeah something like that , something that stands out more . marketing : and then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? the the press buttons . should they be white or black or project manager : red maybe . user interface : and it it looks quite cheap , that colour i think . marketing : uh project manager : black . user interface : it 's it 's not industrial designer : the green ? user interface : yeah . i dunno . marketing : yeah but it 's pretty fresh , on the other side . project manager : yeah . so industrial designer : it 's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment . user interface : it 's it 's trendy okay . but marketing : yeah . my couch is in that colour . project manager : ooh . . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : well it works pretty well . project manager : marketing : and then time was up . project manager : uh not yet . marketing : uh industrial designer : do you get a pop-up if we marketing : . project manager : yeah within five minutes yeah . marketing : that you have five minutes left or industrial designer : alright . project manager : y left yeah left and then uh i have to kick you out . marketing : so something like this . user interface : yeah . marketing : that should be pretty nice colour . but maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . project manager : yeah yeah . industrial designer : no that 's actu marketing : because the of the green . user interface : but the but the buttons have their own leds or not ? project manager : they have leds but they have a colour . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . even for colourblind . marketing : yeah ? industrial designer : they will see one of each as grey . but if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same . marketing : yeah . project manager : user interface : okay . marketing : okay . industrial designer : i think . marketing : so red buttons are okay ? industrial designer : i think so . project manager : you can make them red . user interface : okay . that that 's a default uh setting . the the red buttons . project manager : yeah . but i think you need to keep in mind that the leds are just extra light . marketing : how do you mean ? project manager : uh they they do n't determine the colour that much , i think . marketing : yeah . user interface : okay . yeah i i was think about a red uh red leds and blue leds and project manager : 'cause you have to print on them you have a background marketing : no that 's that 's too busy i guess . user interface : yeah . project manager : each number is transparent . user interface : yeah . project manager : uh partly but you have to print on the number . or the the sign . user interface : okay . project manager : so you ca n't change the colour so marketing : you better bet better better keep the led and the button itself in the same colour i guess . project manager : yeah . user interface : okay . marketing : so just an extra project manager : bit of light . industrial designer : you can marketing : bit of light and attention . project manager : bit of feedback . industrial designer : what we should do i think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured led behind it . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so that the whole button will shine project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : as the colour the and if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it 's easy to hold f for both hands , marketing : industrial designer : but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay with uh do n't mean to discourage you but uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . next thirty minutes to design something so industrial designer : ah , right . marketing : alright . project manager : and the you will do the evaluation . marketing : of the product ? project manager : yeah . marketing : which we do n't have yet . project manager : yeah uh about user interface : marketing : so wh how should i do that ? project manager : yeah i do n't know . you probably get a mail . marketing : oh okay . or you you or you send it to me . or just project manager : yeah . once they are finished . yeah . marketing : because you are going to design it on this board right ? project manager : yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you do n't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . i do n't know . marketing : yeah . i i probably get instruction on that , how to do that , project manager : yeah . marketing : so i make another presentation i guess . project manager : yeah . marketing : i kn i know what 's gon na happen in in yeah so project manager : about . yeah . you have the basic idea . marketing : i 've a basic idea . project manager : and you two uh are going to do this . look-and-feel and user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so we 're gon na work here ? on this sketchboard ? project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : good luck . industrial designer : alright . thanks . marketing : yeah . alright so that 's uh project manager : so i uh make new page and uh be creative . marketing : yeah . user interface : but we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? industrial designer : alright . project manager : yeah you have uh industrial designer : thirty minutes . project manager : thirty minutes . user interface : okay . project manager : then we have to uh see something which we can uh user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : alright . project manager : show to the management . user interface : ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : i would yeah . industrial designer : shall we uh make a new uh project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah l let 's just uh delete all these uh or marketing : yeah . project manager : next . marketing : . industrial designer : yeah , i just make a new one . user interface : oh , next . marketing : yeah . project manager : oh and save this uh board . industrial designer : alright . project manager : just save it . industrial designer : huh ? yeah i 'll just i 'll just keep it there . project manager : yeah okay but just press save and uh industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it 'll be fine . marketing : on the left . s so , yeah . industrial designer : uh sorry . project manager : you can also include clip-art . user interface : industrial designer : okay . project manager : so if you 'll rather draw in paint or something industrial designer : current colour ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so um user interface : okay . uh industrial designer : shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? user interface : yeah . and then after that we can make the user uh inter interface . industrial designer : because i i project manager : then look . industrial designer : yeah 'cause i have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . marketing : this ? project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so how it 's gon na look . and you have to think uh how we 're gon na put the screen in it and those kind of things . marketing : uh pretty accurate . industrial designer : so if i 'm drawing and you think okay i 'm not gon na be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . marketing : oh we skip this i guess . sound button press . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh do you mind if i draw in black then ? for normal sketches . project manager : you can also include it . it 's not much work . user interface : oh no it 's it 's okay . marketing : light only button user ca user interaction . industrial designer : so we kind of want the girlish marketing : project manager : that 's included . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah okay . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : figure . marketing : so the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction . so industrial designer : i 'm not so good at drawing . excuse me ? marketing : well it 's a good thing that the buttons are n't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : no uh uh . marketing : maybe you should draw it very large like this . user interface : yeah but this part is n't uh functioning properly . project manager : yeah . sensitive . marketing : oh right . industrial designer : how do we uh uh marketing : erase ? industrial designer : or insert text ? project manager : i dunno . maybe just start typing . industrial designer : user interface : it 's a bit uh large . industrial designer : oh that 's a bit big . yeah . project manager : you also do the other sides . not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view . user interface : . industrial designer : yeah . ex exactly . user interface : l let 's make first the the the all the views . the the front view , side view and the back view . industrial designer : uh project manager : uh . industrial designer : uh i thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle , where you 're holding it with your project manager : jesus . what do i write down ? marketing : yeah . project manager : why ca n't i work here ? this is much easier . user interface : yeah . marketing : much easier , yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and user interface : the middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . marketing : i do n't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but industrial designer : exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that i think . project manager : no so i just work here a few minutes . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah the display , industrial designer : uh do n't you think ? user interface : we yeah we can put a display . industrial designer : so the display we will put in here , the basic uh functions in here , where it 's most reachable . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : the user interface : the the arrow functions . yeah . yeah . industrial designer : the th exactly . oh . this is hard . user interface : industrial designer : what do do n't have to draw it exactly do we ? user interface : no it 's it 's uh it 's okay . industrial designer : wait . let me try it one more time . maybe i 've uh it 's easier if i draw it in once . okay , of course it will become way more ugly . user interface : you can make it m larger . maybe it 's easier to to draw uh industrial designer : yeah . this 'll take forever . it 's fun to work with this pen . user interface : industrial designer : um so , larger . user interface : yeah that 's that 's the basic idea . yeah . industrial designer : and marketing : wrong one . industrial designer : yeah . so side . project manager : five minutes left before the meeting ends . industrial designer : 'kay . um other views ? project manager : marketing : alright . user interface : yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit . industrial designer : uh user interface : that 's the question . industrial designer : yeah . let 's fill i fill in the buttons later . marketing : but we we user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so this is gon na be from the marketing : i is it if if this is from the side industrial designer : uh from user interface : from the marketing : woah . steady . industrial designer : yeah yeah . sorry . marketing : because there the screen goes up like that right ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so then it 's like this , industrial designer : yeah ? marketing : or that 's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it 's better to have it somewhat like this . or does it flip all the way ? user interface : yeah i 'm i 'm industrial designer : the the idea is that it has to flip up to here . user interface : may maybe it 's it 's easier to to integrate the the the lcd screen just into this this bubble . because it do does n't have to flip then . industrial designer : okay . user interface : because we have en enough space for for making a an l_c_d . industrial designer : yeah . yeah yeah yeah . user interface : because here marketing : it 's better to to have this like this i guess , and then flip it like this . industrial designer : true . user interface : but why why do we need uh the flipping uh industrial designer : you can adjust the angle to which it flips . so it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . user interface : okay . yeah . industrial designer : you can flip it up to there if you want . marketing : yeah . so w yeah . but we still keep the flipping mechanism . project manager : yeah we keep the flip ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : think so . project manager : keep the flip live . industrial designer : yeah because i think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that user interface : marketing : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i dunno . marketing : user interface : uh the the shape is okay but yeah ? i do n't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism . industrial designer : i thought it would be cool . marketing : yeah . user interface : because we okay yeah . it 's it 's for for for more trendy uh marketing : yeah but maybe yeah but maybe we we should then user interface : because we have enough space . h here we got uh the basic functions , the the arrow uh yeah button . marketing : yeah there the middle sh sh should n't we integrate it ? user interface : yeah and then h we sh mm . marketing : and then like i oh th user interface : industrial designer : marketing : doh . come on . so this is the shape . oh . it has n't industrial designer : . it does n't aim so well . user interface : marketing : okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it does n't fall on the screen . user interface : yeah , then it 's marketing : so there 's a layer of rubber on the side . industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah . definitely . project manager : marketing : so no flipping but just user interface : no flipping or project manager : no flipping ? user interface : you wanted the flipping so industrial designer : yeah i guess but uh i mean most votes count right ? user interface : but if you if you if you drop it it it just breaks . and it has to be very strong because of the . yeah kind of project manager : it 's shaking . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : throwing and the kinetics . oh . we better make we better make it like this . eventually . industrial designer : yeah true true . project manager : yeah just light on top . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and it 's also for the for the children , it 's yeah for people not sixteen years . industrial designer : yeah if you if you 're going for the kinetics marketing : yeah . project manager : safer . mm . yeah okay that the target group . user interface : but there are more marketing : uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . yes . user interface : yeah okay . that 's true . okay . yeah ? project manager : well . i just uh ended the meeting . industrial designer : yeah . i 'm just thinking totally different designs also . project manager : you two go design . user interface : okay wi industrial designer : remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a gameboy . project manager : oh . by the way . um user interface : yeah . project manager : industrial designer : maybe we should try something like that . but yeah . marketing : project manager : i uh thought up a name for our product . yeah . it 's called uh the real remote . user interface : industrial designer : oh right . marketing : yeah ? project manager : with a copyright sign after real . marketing : ooh . industrial designer : alright . user interface : the real remote . marketing : yeah . alright . industrial designer : yeah . i like it . project manager : so maybe you can include that somewhere . industrial designer : okay . this can go . marketing : good . yeah . we should work in our own room right ? or not ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well . project manager : i do n't see any power cables here so industrial designer : let 's see . marketing : yeah . yes . industrial designer : what the hell 's that ? project manager : 'kay . user interface : i think uh it 's the sensors . marketing : see you two in half an hour uh user interface : okay . industrial designer : uh project manager : good luck . user interface : yep . okay that 's the side . ah it 's it 's okay . but do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? industrial designer : yeah . i think we do . user interface : or just leave it ? uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button . marketing : industrial designer : yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah . user interface : for menu . or industrial designer : yeah ? i dunno . we w kind of wanted to stick with the user interface : yeah . no , yeah . industrial designer : yeah i 'm just thinking , if we i we wan na make something different project manager : industrial designer : right ? so the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i think ."
