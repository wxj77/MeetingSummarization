    "answer": "project manager : okay . right , well done , catherine . um gab gabriel let 's uh let 's hear from you on on on such things . user interface : okay . industrial designer : do you need the border ? user interface : uh i 'm just gon na use the powerpoint uh . industrial designer : okay . sorry . user interface : technical . okay . marketing : user interface : okay , so , while this is warming up , marketing : adjusting . user interface : there it is uh . marketing : yeah . user interface : so i 'm doing the user interface design . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , i was i was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . we do n't want to do something that 's too radical of a change , i guess , i mean people want a remote that 's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but project manager : mm yeah . user interface : um so we can improve what 's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . uh one thing that i did n't include here , that i forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . project manager : okay . user interface : uh , i do n't i dunno , uh that 's one possibility . and so in the research that i was doing there 's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which i do n't know if i can access the web page from here , but i can show you uh . yeah . so this is a engineer centred one , so you see it 's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : uh and this is a user centred one . uh it 's it 's easier to g just glance at this and see what 's possible to do , project manager : yeah . user interface : you 're not gon na be staring at it for five minutes . project manager : great . user interface : and i judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting i kind of gathered that that 's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . um . so , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , reissa , marketing : user interface : because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . project manager : yeah . marketing : . user interface : so uh , yeah , that 's me . project manager : great . okay . now that 's i just have a q a q question for you . this w um research that you 've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units stuff . um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or user interface : no that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as i know . i mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones . project manager : yeah . user interface : that was sort of the inspiration for it . um i 've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business . project manager : yeah . user interface : i 've , have n't i 've never seen a locking functionality . i dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that 's really necessary ? project manager : um i would say it 's if it 's simple to do , which i think it probably should be , user interface : yeah . project manager : even if it 's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , user interface : mm-hmm . 'kay . project manager : it 's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , user interface : right . project manager : but you know being physical . look into . um i 've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we 've got ta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . it 's got ta d look like it 's in the r_ and r_ . user interface : mm . project manager : you know , the the company it 's it 's , from what i can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . um . marketing : mm . user interface : right . and our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . project manager : we put the fashion in electronics . there you go . user interface : i think i think we have to carry that mental . project manager : so it 's kinda got ta look it 's got ta look new and s you know something fashionable . if if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be . user interface : well yeah these , i think , we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what i did n't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . project manager : yeah . because we need user interface : i t i think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , i mean . project manager : yeah . great . industrial designer : user interface : uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there 's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , i guess . um . project manager : okay , fantastic . marketing : okay . project manager : right , well done , gabriel . marketing : . project manager : um reissa . let 's plug you in , baby . marketing : where does it go into ? user interface : . marketing : here ? user interface : yeah . marketing : the blue thing . user interface : uh , yeah , this is getting all . marketing : user interface : mm . marketing : . user interface : yeah , then you just have to do function f_ eight and it should come up . marketing : well , function f_ eight . no project manager : yeah , w it it just takes a wee while ."
