    "query": "<s> what did justintrudeau elaborate on the governmental fund when discussing the issue of allocating the fund and dealing with systematic racism ?",
    "answer": "mr. yves-franois blanchet : if the idea is so good and wonderful , why not start over and open the dialogue now ? what 's stopping the prime minister from being a rallying point and inviting us to take to each other and resolve the problem , rather than saying that he is going to pack up his toys and go home ? the people with disabilities are the ones who will pay the price . where was the prime minister on october21,2019 ? he received a minority mandate from quebeckers and canadians . why is he behaving like something between a prime minister with a majority and a monarch by divine right ? right hon . justin trudeau : i 've heard the conservative party and the bloc qubcois throw their accusations around . they do n't point out that the house of commons did indeed give its consent to extend the mandate of the special committee on the covid-19 pandemic until the end of june . three parties agreed , which was the right thing to do in the context of this minority government . we 've been working with the other parties . however , as they did not get the results they wanted , they complained . unfortunately , they too are part of a minority parliament and must respect the voice of the majority of parliamentarians , just as we do . mr. yves-franois blanchet : i might have been tempted , but that 's unlikely to happen because the prime minister is n't me , he 's him . it 's therefore up to him to bring people together , open a dialogue and recall parliament . all we were asking for was the opportunity to talk for an hour or two . however , suddenly he does n't want to play anymore . it 's not working anymore , and there 's something a bit strange about that . in addition , the government wants to buy the right to interfere in provincial and quebec jurisdictions for $ 14billion . however , quebec and a number of provinces are refusing to allow it to interfere in their jurisdictions and are asking that this money be paid to them unconditionally . is the prime minister trying to take advantage of the crisis or is he trying to create a constitutional crisis ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , the safety of canadians is the responsibility of all levels of government . that 's why we have proposed a $ 14billion agreement to ensure that all canadians across the country experience a safe re-opening of the economy . this is a proposal that we are working on with the provinces because we know that there are needs across the country , including early childhood centres , screening and support for municipalities . the federal government wants to be there to help the provinces ."
