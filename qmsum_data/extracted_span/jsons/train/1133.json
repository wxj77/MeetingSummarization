    "answer": "julie morgan am : i wanted to ask about special schools in terms of your views about the standards in special schools\u2014whether you 've got any views on that . meilyr rowlands : yes , we highlighted special schools as a successful sector in the annual report , as we have over many years . over 90 per cent of them are good or better . it 's a very successful sector . the small number of schools that do n't do quite as well tend to be the schools that deal with children with emotional and behavioural difficulties . but the sector as a whole is a good example of sharing good practice . they work very , very well together . they 're constantly\u2014 . it 's difficult to say why that is in this particular sector , as opposed to other sectors . possibly they do n't have an overlap in catchment areas , they 're quite geographically separate , so they do n't feel as if they 're in competition with one another . but they certainly work very well together , sharing good practice , doing peer reviews of each other . so , it is a successful sector . julie morgan am : and that includes the independent sector ."
