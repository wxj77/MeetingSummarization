    "query": "<s> what did julie morgan think about unforeseen costs when talking about resource implications ?",
    "answer": "hefin david am : when you first appeared before the committee at the beginning of stage 1 , i was n't hugely reassured by the evidence you gave on the resource implications of the bill . it seems to be relying , to a great extent , on the limited number of reporting of cases that 's likely to happen , as we 've seen in the evidence we 've received . that 's largely been recognised by the stakeholders who 've given evidence , but is n't there still the potential for a degree of unknown costs to come into this , and what planning have you done for those unknown costs\u2014those unforeseen costs\u2014that might occur ? julie morgan am : i feel that\u2014 . you 're right that there always could be unknown costs , but we are doing our very best to prepare to cover all eventualities that we can anticipate . for example , i 've committed to fund the high-intensity awareness-raising campaign , and committed to carry out a mapping exercise to establish whether there are any gaps in the parenting support . we know that evidence from other countries does show that , if we bring in this legislation and raise awareness , it does change people 's attitudes , so there may , in the long term , be a saving if we do that . but we are committed to working with organisations to put in place arrangements so that we 're able to collect the data so that we know what the impact is . but i just have to repeat that all our evidence , looking at other countries , is that there is n't a huge increase in the workload . hefin david am : no . i think you can make the argument for precedent elsewhere , but you can also say that every country has a different culture and approach to how it raises children , and therefore there 'll be a number of differences as well . the explanatory memorandum raises some specific cases . it talks about unknown costs in relation to social services as a result of a potential increasing referrals ; family courts and cafcass cymru as a result of a potential increase in allegations , which we talked about ; the cps and a higher volume of requests for charging advice from the police ; and the review of training and guidance offered by organisations involved in the safeguarding of children . all those things we 've talked around , but what would be reassuring for the committee is , perhaps , if you could give us a broad figure , which the government would say , 'we 'll need to set this number aside in order to be prepared for the implementation of this bill . ' would you be willing to present that at some point during the passage of the bill ? julie morgan am : i think we have to rely on what the people who run those organisations are telling us . certainly , the cps say that they can cope . cafcass say that they can cope . and it is very difficult to anticipate what impact there would be on social services . the people who are managing social services say they do n't anticipate a big impact . i think the other important thing to recognise is that this area of work is already dealt with by all these people . so , the cps is already involved in changing its guidance all the time , so it 's not going to be much of an impact for them to actually have to do that over this issue . social services are already dealing with calls and referrals about the physical punishment of children already , including reasonable punishment . and so it 's not a new category of work . i accept that we 're working in a situation where there 's a general pressure on public services , but i think this area that we 're legislating on here is part of what everybody 's doing already . and so i do n't see it as such a big thing in terms of impact . hefin david am : that 's a perfectly reasonable answer , but then what about providing a ballpark figure for a kind unforeseen fund that you might set aside ?"
