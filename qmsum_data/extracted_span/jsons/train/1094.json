    "answer": "the chair : we will now continue with mr. saroya . mr. bob saroya ( markhamunionville , cpc ) : thank you , mr . chair . covid-19 has sparked and spurred anti-asian racism . these are not just racist comments online ; asian canadians have been attacked . what is the government doing to combat anti-asian racism ? hon . bardish chagger ( minister of diversity and inclusion and youth ) : mr . chair , since our government took office in 2015 , we have been making investments and working with communities . the difference between our government and the previous government is that we will actually consult with canadians , including black canadians , including asian canadians , to respond to the challenges , including with an anti-racism secretariat and an anti-racism strategy . it will take all of us . i appreciate the member 's question , so that we can also work together . mr. bob saroya : mr . chair , one business owner i know in markham has operated for 20 years . now she 's looking at over $ 9,000 in rent due on june 24 . covid-19 has crippled her sales and she 's going to go out of business . her landlord has no interest in the canada emergency commercial rent assistance program . how can the government say this program is working ? hon . mona fortier : mr . chair , this program was made possible by working with the provinces , and we will continue to encourage landlords and tenants to work together to make sure they have relief for this very difficult time in which they 're living . we 're continuing to monitor the cecra program and we will make it possible for businesses to have access to the program . mr. bob saroya : mr . chair , the government business rent relief program has been a total disaster . even the government 's own numbers show it is a failure . as of june 8 , less than 2 % of the $ 3 billion budgeted has been spent . what is it going to take for the government to admit that the program is a disaster and needs changes ? hon . mona fortier : mr . chair , we know our government has been working closely with the provinces and territories to deliver the canada emergency commercial rent assistance . although the tenant-landlord relationship is ultimately the responsibility of the provinces and territories , our government has stepped up to provide support through the tools we have and through cmhc so that small businesses can get the rent relief they need . mr. bob saroya : mr . chair , according to the government , there are around 1.1 million small businesses in canada . at committee , we were told only around 5,500 of them are receiving covid-19 rent relief . that number is shameful . when will the liberal government wake up and make the changes ? hon . mona fortier : mr . chair , we welcome the steps some provinces and territories have taken to further protect commercial tenants . we will continue to monitor this program closely and ensure that canada 's small businesses are supported during this challenging time . we will continue to monitor to see the chair : we 'll go back to mr. saroya . mr. bob saroya : mr . chair , there was no answer . when can the government make these changes ? hon . mary ng ( minister of small business , export promotion and international trade ) : mr . chair , i want to assure the honourable colleague that we are doing everything and will continue to do everything to help small businesses in our country . mr. bob saroya : mr . chair , on may 27 the cbsa seized 65 small handguns at pearson airport , the largest firearms seizure on record . it is clear that smuggled handguns are the weapon of choice for criminals . why is the prime minister focusing on an ineffective municipal ban ? hon . bill blair ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) : mr . chair , i would point out that gun violence in any of our communities is unacceptable , and it 's important that governments and communities take steps to prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals . that 's why we do important work at our border to keep guns from being smuggled into our country , but it also necessitates additional work . i do n't think you can talk about gun violence without talking about stronger gun control . that 's why our government has taken a very strong position and will strengthen gun control to keep canadians safe . the chair : mr. saroya , you may have a 10-second question , if that 's possible , please . mr. bob saroya : mr . chair , covid-19 has not stopped gun violence in the gta . my constituents are concerned about shootings minutes away from their homes . we know the liberals ' gun ban wo n't change anything , but a focus on smuggled guns and criminals will . when will they make that change ?"
