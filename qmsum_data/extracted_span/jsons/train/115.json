    "answer": "sian gwenllian am : no , to meet the demand . julie morgan am : in other areas , it 's much , much lower\u2014in some of the cities , i know . so , there is a big range in take-up\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : so , do you intend to bring something forward to address that ? julie morgan am : we are planning to extend it . we 're looking at the possibility of extending it to parents who are in education and training . so , we are widening the offer , yes . obviously , we have to wait for the evaluation of that . it would be great to be able to offer it to absolutely everybody , but obviously we have got the finance to look at in terms of how we do that . but we are certainly planning to expand it . lynne neagle am : we 've got questions on the offer in a little while . janet . janet finch-saunders am : does the welsh government intend to develop an integrated approach , then , against all settings ? if so , given the current inconsistencies , how can quality be assured ? julie morgan am : we are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years . as i 've said , we 're trying to have the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings , and we 're already developing that . but estyn and ciw will continue to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards , and , since january 2019 , ciw and estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase . so , that is a very positive move , i think , and is absolutely making sure that standards are maintained , because if we are having the foundation phase in non-maintained settings , that is a challenge where we want to be sure that the standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase are maintained . so , we have got the system of inspection to ensure that . janet finch-saunders am : and finally from me , what specific steps have been put in place to take forward the commitments from the welsh government 's 2017 childcare/play early years workforce plan to build a better understanding of the workforce 's welsh language skills to enable support for the sector to be targeted and to identify where capacity needs to be built for the future to meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual wales ? julie morgan am : we think this is very important , and we 're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in welsh or bilingual settings , so we think that 's very good . we have established a specific programme to develop welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the national centre for learning welsh , to develop workplace welsh language skills across the sector . so , we 're actually working with that , and i think you 've done something with those recently , have n't you ? i do n't know if you want to\u2014 nicola edwards : yes . so , we have a stakeholder group where we 've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years , childcare and play sectors , and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they 're rolling out , and how this is all coming together , which is quite interesting . we 've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in welsh and bilingually . recruitment and retention within the childcare and play sector is quite challenging in any case . recruiting and retaining staff with really good welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it , and that it 's a point that mudiad meithrin makes to us quite regularly , that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills . so , upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it , but also doing more to attract people in with welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we 're taking forward , and thinking about that in the context of the targets within cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million welsh speakers . so , as the deputy minister said , we 've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment . we 're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities ' welsh in education strategic plans and education places , and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning welsh , interacting with education and childcare through welsh at a much earlier stage . lynne neagle am : suzy , you 've got a supplementary . suzy davies am : just on this early point , anybody who 's been through the welsh education system , which is 20 years now , will have some welsh language skills , obviously to differing degrees . for the entrants that are coming into childcare training now , there are going to be very few of them , realistically , with no welsh at all , so what 's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure , at that stage , that the welsh language skills are being developed , as opposed to an add-on later on ? nicola edwards : you 're quite right . most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of welsh although i think it 's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales . suzy davies am : yes , but the majority , being realistic . nicola edwards : but they do n't necessarily have welsh that is appropriate . they 've got welsh that they 've developed in school . it 's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children , who may be coming from families who do n't use welsh at home . so , that might be the first interaction that child has with the language . so , there 's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually , particularly if they 're coming from english-medium homes , and reinforcing the language in language choices . there will also be some people who are , perhaps\u2014we see this quite a lot in the office\u2014quite confident in terms of speaking welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork , the reporting , the writing and the interacting with parents more officially , which we need to think about as well . but it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way ."
