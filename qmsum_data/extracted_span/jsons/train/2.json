    "answer": "industrial designer : i 'm sorry to be late . project manager : welcome back everybody . user interface : yeah . thanks . project manager : so this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting . and uh opening and uh pms of the meet minutes , uh prototype presentation from uh christine and uh agnes . industrial designer : agnes , yes . project manager : yes and uh evaluation criteria . the finance , it 's uh from my side , from the management , and uh production evaluation . then uh closing . so we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so okay , let 's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype . user interface : mm , okay . project manager : so i handle to user interface : i 've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we 've both done , so if i 'm missing anything , christine can just correct me . project manager : so shall i go to sorry . industrial designer : uh thank you , so you did a powerpoint presentation , good for you . project manager : yep . s okay , let 's go to ami . user interface : it 's not the biggest powerpoint presentation in the world , but industrial designer : marketing : project manager : so in two or three or industrial designer : user interface : three . um . no it 's marketing : probably . technical pa i would think . user interface : think it 's the last one . no , then this is the la yeah , that one , final design . project manager : yeah . user interface : it is named appropriately , you just could n't see the name . industrial designer : marketing : user interface : um okay , can i have the mouse ? thanks . alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the tv on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we 've incorporated the lcd screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it 's too expensive , well then you just take it off . um , so to unveil our lovely product . this is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see . marketing : user interface : so if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow lcd display . um , this is actually hard to do . the yellow button you have is the on off button , so it 's really big , hard to miss . you have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . so up volume up , down volume down . the green are the channel changing . s and it 's one of those very light , very touchable displays . and then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the tv , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . so this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um and uh i could user interface : oh yes . industrial designer : yeah the d"
