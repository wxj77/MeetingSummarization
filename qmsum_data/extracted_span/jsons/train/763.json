stuff like that . next meeting starts in thirty minutes . at quarter to twelve . user interface : so i think before we close uh , we are expected i mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . i mean if you wan na go back to the last slide . uh project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , i think we 're i mean before we close the meeting , we 're supposed to come up with some ideas for project manager : oh k so we 're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : oh okay . user interface : yeah . project manager : i thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but user interface : yeah , i think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . project manager : okay . right , who 's got experiences with remote controls then ? pretty much everybody . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , i think we 've all got marketing : uh . industrial designer : is this a tv one we are supposed to make ? marketing : yeah . yeah it 's a tv remote control . industrial designer : okay . project manager : 'kay um . marketing : well . a new remote control for tv . what would i like ? um . project manager : w what you want it big do you want it small . are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that 's that 's big and marketing : medium . user interface : mm . yeah it seems like there 's like there 's sort of a tension between two ideas , i mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of tv and if you have whatever associated with tv the d_v_d_ player , or something like that , project manager : video and ts hi-fi and stuff . user interface : but like at the same time you do n't wan na really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . project manager : maybe you yeah now th that 's the other thing is it 's got ta be cheap . user interface : yeah . project manager : 'cause i i i mean i was thinking something that 's got different like maybe a a an lcd display on it that 's got different pages for different devices , marketing : project manager : but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . industrial designer : but how do we know how much uh , i mean , how much do we have per how much ? marketing : twelve fifty . industrial designer : twelve fifty . user interface : it g ca n't be more than twelve fifty per unit . marketing : each . project manager : per unit , yeah . user interface : cost . industrial designer : so do we have to be realistic within the budget or project manager : well at the moment we could , wa i mean we industrial designer : close pr i do n't know how much it would cost . yeah . marketing : guess project manager : 'cause we this is what we th what we 're doing at the moment is just saying what what we 'd like , and then after we after we 've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . industrial designer : right . project manager : so would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . user interface : yeah . marketing : could n't we have like one that comes out ? like so you have one in like mm industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it does n't have to be really thick . i mean remote controls can be thin bits . and then you have one for your d_v_d_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out . project manager : 'kay . marketing : have slides . and then it all comes compact project manager : okay , that 's . marketing : into one . so it 's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . user interface : project manager : th that 's an idea . user interface : yeah . marketing : so you just flip them out . project manager : okay . industrial designer : um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . i can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . project manager : one side for kids , one side for adults . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i 'm not sure if that 's like industrial designer : or grandma as well , you know it 's like what is the mute button . user interface : i 'm not sure if it 's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . industrial designer : no , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you would n't be able to press the buttons , but project manager : like it user interface : oh okay . project manager : or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . user interface : yeah . okay . marketing : that would be cool . project manager : f flip it open and you 've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you 've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . marketing : i was thinking that like a flip . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : um , oh we 've got five minutes left . industrial designer : start breaking up . project manager : but okay . marketing : okay . um . project manager : well we 've got a k we 've got a few ideas there . user interface : yeah , we should uh marketing : . user interface : i guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . okay . um so i mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we 're sure that we want are that it can control the tv , but also devices connected to the to the tv , i mean , be able to operate project manager : yeah . user interface : d_v_d_ players , things like that . project manager : i have got i think we should also have a back-up plan of i 'cause i i i just think that it might be expensive to make something that i mean we do n't , we have n't been told it has to be something that will control everything . we should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a tv , but it 's just a really good , nice one . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : okay . right . project manager : what do you reckon ? see 'cause , i 'm just thinking bearing in mind th we 've got ta we have to have something that 's cheap to make . user interface : yeah , i mean . yeah , that 's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good tv remote , and have it be um project manager : i think we 'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . user interface : have it be like ergonomic so it 's comfortable to use , project manager : yeah . user interface : uh simple to use , and looks decent and project manager : may w you know , maybe even marketing : but what 'll make it what 'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? project manager : or maybe even so something that 's for disabled people marketing : i mean if it 's if it 's just like project manager : or so people that uh b do n't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for user interface : sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : or just one that looks really fucking cool . user interface : certain certain demographic industrial designer : user interface : project manager : marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : could be really light or , i dunno , something special . user interface : yeah , no i think you 're right . yeah , rathe rather than focus on project manager : otherwise we 'll be we 'll be here all day talking about do this let 's do that n i think we sh i think we should user interface : y yeah . industrial designer : yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just tv remote , does n't say com combination with all all the r user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . i mean obviously everyone we 're uh you know uh sounds like we 're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that 's user interface : remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : yeah , that 's right . yeah . i mean i 'd like one that makes tea as well , but that 's not gon na happen . industrial designer : marketing : i think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it 's on this well i did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you 'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone 's the television switched on or something . so maybe something that like does have a lid or closes , so you do n't accidentally press a button or record button for something . project manager : okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah . marketing : yeah . but make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . so make it yeah . project manager : yeah , it 's got ta be sellable . yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , that 's true what you were saying , i mean it does n't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it 's not uh not usable when you do n't want it to be usable . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : and even for kids as well . it 's um it 's safer for them , i guess . like they do n't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . project manager : no porn channel for children . industrial designer : user interface : industrial designer : project manager : okay . um alright , industrial designer : okay . marketing : project manager : so we 've got some ideas , we 've got um user interface : i guess that 's good good for now . project manager : let 's move on . oops , let 's close that . next meeting , uh okay . marketing : w what does i_d_v_i_d_n_m_e_ stand for ? project manager : industrial designer um which is marketing : ah ri okay . these are requirement specification . industrial designer : that 's mm . marketing : and i 'm marketing . project manager : yeah , there you go . so user interface designer , that 's that 's user interface : that 's me . okay . project manager : that 's you , so you got ta you go , you 're you 're gon na be the one that 's working out what what buttons we need . um . user interface : right . right . project manager : industrial designer , you are the one , you know , you 're gon na be working out kind of box it goes in , i guess so , um whether it 's what goes into the box , somehow . industrial designer : mm . har how it works an project manager : and in marketing marketing : these are requirement specification . project manager : user requirements specifications . marketing : so what the user requires project manager : yeah , what industrial designer : do you think our two kind of overlap , because marketing : in a remote . project manager : right , okay , yeah . user interface : yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . marketing : i guess that 's what it says . project manager : you two you two are gon na be just , i think , you just double up , you know , you working together . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : you 're the one that 's got ta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . oh , we 've been warned to finish the meeting now . okay . okay everyone , well done . user interface : project manager : good meeting . user interface : alright , see you in thirty minutes . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : so , do we take these off ?"
