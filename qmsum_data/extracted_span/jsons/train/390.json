    "answer": "janet finch-saunders am : yes , but how will any gaps in your data be addressed ? dr frank atherton : well , one of the questions that are often asked is : could we measure more on a longitudinal basis ? by that i mean in england , for example , children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12. , that kind of age group . and so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what 's happening to children . i think that would be helpful to us in wales , and it 's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that . obviously , that would have significant resource implications , not just for the funding , but also for schools and for the system to deliver it . but it 's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier . nathan cook : and the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study , which has been released , for 14 and 15-year-olds . that 's going to be\u2014 . we 're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data , looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well , which will be really helpful ."
