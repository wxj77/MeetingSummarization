reusable . industrial designer : something we should get . project manager : i do n't know what this is but it 's really really annoying . marketing : so uh brian , have you have you finished ? project manager : uh-huh . marketing : uh mine needs also this . project manager : um i have , yes . marketing : at last mine is also the presentation . project manager : huh ?

okay . marketing : uh is the project evaluated , that is mine . project manager : does n't tell me . oh you 're doing that . marketing : yeah . project manager : we evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great . marketing : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : user interface : mm , love to eat that now . industrial designer : anybody user interface : kind of a green banana now . industrial designer : clay covered banana . user interface : it 's this as well , sorry , we forgot to mention it 'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we 've got . project manager : o okay , hold on . user interface : i 've got . industrial designer : blue . project manager : i wonder w which cell do i want . industrial designer : it 's fun to touch . user interface : yeah . marketing : so . yeah . project manager : okay , i did n't realise you had that bit . marketing : so . user interface : oh could you pass the tomato please . project manager : user interface : sorry . thank you . marketing : so now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . how we are going to user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not . how mu what rating we will give to these products . so of course this is will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . so what methodology i will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . project manager : okay . marketing : we will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . then marketing strategy of the company . as we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s user interface : sorry . sorry , marketing : yeah . user interface : carry on . marketing : so but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . so now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . i 'm having this scale this scale , project manager : okay . marketing : so we have to do it on a board . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : the user requirem i think . project manager : alright , okay . user interface : okay . project manager : the board working again , is it ? industrial designer : do we have the uh the marker for the board ? project manager : uh . industrial designer : there it is . marketing : thank you . project manager : user interface : marketing : so these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . first of all uh comes user requirement . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . i i will first i would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? user interface : um i think yeah , it did . it had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . project manager : yeah . user interface : um so . project manager : when the user requirement is essentially just to operate the tv , user interface : does it work ? project manager : so yeah , user interface : yeah . so . marketing : so what do you think you will personally give . project manager : of course we have n't actually got a working model yet . user interface : i would say seven . marketing : seven . uh . user interface : seven is good , yeah , is n't it ? i ca n't true or false ? no sorry tr one is true . marketing : project manager : one , yeah . marketing : uh one is means highest ranking , okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : but i think highest ranking is seven , or one ? project manager : no it 's it 's like true is one end , and false is the oth industrial designer : no that 's false . marketing : okay , right right . so it 's one for from your point of view . user interface : okay , so one . marketing : and what do you say our industrial expert ? industrial designer : uh . it 's hard to know . i i give it a two . marketing : uh d you can you can tell on on the like project manager : marketing : i think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i interface expert . industrial designer : okay . marketing : but you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? industrial designer : um yeah , i think i it might even exceed it um . but i guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . project manager : industrial designer : um i 'm gon na give it a two . marketing : and what about uh you , brian ? project manager : oh , i 'll go for a one . marketing : you will go for one . project manager : basic requirements but of the pro of the project . marketing : okay . uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , industrial designer : project manager : yeah th user interface : mm yellow . marketing : uh yeah , lower end . and the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : but if a person does n't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . user interface : uh-huh . project manager : come on that was the tha marketing : no , do n't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . project manager : 'kay . user interface : uh-huh . marketing : so we are showing our preference for particular fruits , user interface : okay . industrial designer : project manager : being fruitist . marketing : two or three kinds rather , and yeah . so . user interface : is that no is that not trends ? marketing : uh no , uh personally as a marketing expert i do n't believe that , project manager : marketing : because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . industrial designer : marketing : so you can what shape a person will like . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . and by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . user interface : uh-huh . but in electronics , i think , it 's not q always quite so um you do n't always have so many choices as with chocolates . project manager : user interface : i think , you know , if you 're going to buy a tv maybe a company 'll have that you 're going to choose from , a company 'll have two or three choices , but they 're different designs . we were coming up with one product . marketing : uh maybe . okay but i will i will personally wo n't give it beyond three . project manager : user interface : no , i mean uh obviously your opinion , industrial designer : user interface : i 'm just trying to okay . marketing : so we can project manager : he 's a tough cookie . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . three or four ? project manager : marketing : uh , no sorry , industrial designer : marketing : it should be project manager : six . five or six . user interface : what are we doing ? industrial designer : what are we doing ? marketing : no sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . user interface : adding them up ? industrial designer : we 're gon na average them ? marketing : yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , industrial designer : okay . so seven fourths . marketing : and that 's i have taken it very wrongly . yeah uh industrial designer : about one point f one point eight . marketing : three four four two six seven seven sev yeah one pe exactly . so we can say one or two . industrial designer : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . industrial designer : project manager : oh i see . industrial designer : yeah round it up to two . marketing : yeah . user interface : okay , yeah . industrial designer : so trends . marketing : so where were the trends . industrial designer : can you explain what you want us to write there ? marketing : sorry ? industrial designer : how it how conforms to the current trends ? marketing : yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : user interface : okay . well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , i would give it um , well , because it 's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , project manager : user interface : so i would actually give it a three . marketing : user interface : tha three or four , i 'm not sure . marketing : okay . yeah . user interface : three . go for three . that 's fine . marketing : uh industrial designer : 'kay . as far as the uh technology it its ' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it 's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , um but it does n't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . so i give it a a four . i 'd give it a kinda middle of the road for for technology . project manager : yeah , i am sort of pret uh just the fruit does me in , i mean uh it might user interface : industrial designer : marketing : project manager : it might be trendy to some , but i 'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : uh also uh i would have liked to have seen the lcd screen in it . um so yeah i 'd say about four as well . marketing : okay . uh personally i wi uh i think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so and in this way our product is good . and the second thing , now people do n't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . project manager : marketing : so that is also ef that also user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . and yes . it is cus spongy also . so they can play with it , it 's quite good . project manager : marketing : so then i think , maybe i can give it two . so four five ten thirteen thirteen . so we can is it fine ? so what about company strategy ? industrial designer : yeah . well it was yellow . project manager : user interface : yeah , the company strategy , okay . um there was lot of discussing , that was good . um i feel i got my say . um so i 'd give the company strategy a two . industrial designer : well , i think it 's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . marketing : okay . user interface : okay . industrial designer : is that the question ? project manager : yeah , yeah . user interface : is it ? okay . industrial designer : um . user interface : okay , so one or two . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : one . okay , just leave it , it 's fine . industrial designer : i 'll go with two . marketing : so what about you , brian ? project manager : um yeah , a three . pretty much kept to the company strategy , so i would go for a a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by marketing : yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers ' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . so since our product meets all these requirements , so i would also prefer to give it rank one . so four six six industrial designer : so one and a half . marketing : half . user interface : yeah , one . marketing : so we can say two or one industrial designer : a two . marketing : okay . so th seven seven . uh overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two . yeah . so i think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . project manager : cool , groovy . user interface : okay . marketing : so we can launch it . yeah . project manager : cool . brilliant . user interface : woo-hoo . project manager : in which case we are done . 'cause we 've evaluated and we are within budget . industrial designer : okay . user interface : cool . project manager : champagne lunch anyone ? industrial designer : user interface : yeah ."
