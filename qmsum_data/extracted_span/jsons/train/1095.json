    "query": "<s> why did bob saroya disagree with the government when talking about reducing the rent for those individual businesses ?",
    "answer": "mr. bob saroya : mr . chair , one business owner i know in markham has operated for 20 years . now she 's looking at over $ 9,000 in rent due on june 24 . covid-19 has crippled her sales and she 's going to go out of business . her landlord has no interest in the canada emergency commercial rent assistance program . how can the government say this program is working ? hon . mona fortier : mr . chair , this program was made possible by working with the provinces , and we will continue to encourage landlords and tenants to work together to make sure they have relief for this very difficult time in which they 're living . we 're continuing to monitor the cecra program and we will make it possible for businesses to have access to the program . mr. bob saroya : mr . chair , the government business rent relief program has been a total disaster . even the government 's own numbers show it is a failure . as of june 8 , less than 2 % of the $ 3 billion budgeted has been spent . what is it going to take for the government to admit that the program is a disaster and needs changes ? hon . mona fortier : mr . chair , we know our government has been working closely with the provinces and territories to deliver the canada emergency commercial rent assistance . although the tenant-landlord relationship is ultimately the responsibility of the provinces and territories , our government has stepped up to provide support through the tools we have and through cmhc so that small businesses can get the rent relief they need . mr. bob saroya : mr . chair , according to the government , there are around 1.1 million small businesses in canada . at committee , we were told only around 5,500 of them are receiving covid-19 rent relief . that number is shameful . when will the liberal government wake up and make the changes ?"
