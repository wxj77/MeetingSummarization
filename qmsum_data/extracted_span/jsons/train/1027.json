    "answer": "postdoc b : oh ! i was n't supposed to phd e : yeah . grad a : no , that 's alright . postdoc b : sorry . sorry . grad a : the digit form does n't have a `` for official use only `` line . it just has a line , which is what you 're supposed to read . postdoc b : that uh ok . grad a : so on the digits form , everything above the line is a fill - in form postdoc b : sorry about that . yeah . grad a : and everything below the line is digits that the user reads . postdoc b : yeah . ok . alright s but i did n't mean to derail our discussion here , so you really wanted to start with this other form . grad a : no , either way is fine i just you just started talking about something , and i did n't know which form you were referring to . postdoc b : alright yeah , i was comparing so th this is so i was looking at the change first . so it 's like we started with this and now we 've got a new version of it wi with reference to this . so the digit form , we had one already . now the f the fields are slightly different . professor c : so the main thing that the person fills out um is the name and email and time ? phd e : yeah . grad a : right . professor c : you do the rest ? grad a : yep . just as uh as i have for all the others . postdoc b : what and there 's an addition of the native language , which is a bit redundant . professor c : right . postdoc b : this one has native language and this one does too . grad a : that 's because the one , the digit form that has native language is the old form not the new form . postdoc b : oh ! thank you . thank you , thank you . there we go . phd e : yeah . postdoc b : oh , yeah . i 'll catch up here . ok , i see . professor c : `` south midland , north midland `` postdoc b : that 's the old and that 's the new . grad a : yeah this was the problem with these categories , i i picked those categories from timit . i do n't know what those are . phd d : actually , the only way i know is from working with the database and having to figure it out . phd e : what grad a : with timit , yeah ? phd e : uh - huh . grad a : so , i was gon na ask phd e : what i professor c : so is south midland like kansas ? grad a : wh w i mean . professor c : and north midland like like uh illinois , or ? phd d : well yeah . nor - um phd e : yeah . grad a : so so what accent are we speaking ? western ? professor c : by definition ? phd e : and for simple for for me ? professor c : well , phd d : probably western , yeah . phd e : is mean my native language spanish spanish ? eh the original is the center of spain and the beca grad a : yeah , i mean you could call it whatever you want . for the foreign language we could n't classify every single one . so i just left it blank and you can put whatever you want . phd e : because is different , the span - uh the spanish language from the the north of spain , of the south , of the west and the grad a : sure . so i 'm not sure what to do about the region field for english variety . you know , when i wrote i was writing those down , i was thinking , `` you know , these are great if you 're a linguist `` . phd e : yeah . grad a : but i do n't know how to i do n't know how to i do n't know how to categorize them . postdoc b : yeah . phd d : actually even if you t postdoc b : yeah . professor c : if you 're if e if y phd d : this was n't developed by th these regions were n't professor c : if you 're a ti or mit from nineteen eighty - five . grad a : yeah so i guess my only question was if if you were a south midland speaking region , person ? would you know it ? professor c : yeah . phd d : mm - hmm . grad a : is that what you would call yourself ? phd d : i do n't know . grad a : yeah . professor c : you know , i think if you 're talking if you 're thinking in terms of places , as opposed to names different peop names people have given to different ways of talking , i would think north midwest , and south midwest would be more common than saying midland , right , i mean , i i went to s phd d : yeah . now the usage maybe we can give them a li like a little map ? with the regions and they just no , i 'm serious . postdoc b : no , that 's not bad . yeah . phd d : because it takes less time , and it 's sort of cute phd e : i at this in that side in that side of the the paper . phd d : there 's no figure . professor c : well . phd d : well just a little you know , it does n't have all the detail , but you sort of professor c : but what if you moved five times and and uh postdoc b : well , i was thinking you could have ma multiple ones and then the amount of time phd d : no , but you 're categorized . that 's the same postdoc b : so , roughly . so . you could say , you know `` ten years on the east coast , five years on the west coast `` or something or other . grad a : well , we i think we do n't want to get that level of detail at this form . i think that 's alright if we want to follow up . but . professor c : i guess we do n't really know . phd d : i mean i as i said , i do n't think there 's a huge benefit to this region thing . it it gets the problem is that for some things it 's really clear and usually listening to { comment } it you can tell right away if it 's a new york or boston accent , but new york and boston are two well , i guess they have the nyc , but new england has a bunch of very different dialects and postdoc b : mm - hmm . phd d : and so does um s so do other places . grad a : yeah , so i picked these regions cuz we had talked about timit , and those are right from timit . phd d : right . and so these would be satisfying like a speech research community if we released the database , but as to whether subjects know where they 're from , i 'm not sure because um i know that they had to fill this out for switchboard . this is i almost exactly the same as switchboard regions postdoc b : oh . ok . phd d : or very close . yeah . um and i do n't know how they filled that out . but th if midland yeah , midland is the one that 's difficult i guess . postdoc b : i think a lot of people yeah . phd d : also northwest you 've got oreg - washington and oregon now which uh y people do n't know if it 's western or northern . grad a : yeah , i certainly do n't . i mean , i was saying i do n't even know what i speak . phd d : it 's like northwest grad a : am i speaking am i speaking western ? professor c : oh , what is northern ? well and what and what 's northern ? phd d : i think originally it was north northwest grad a : northwest ? phd d : but phd e : yeah . grad a : yeah , so this is a real problem . i do n't know what to do about it . phd d : yeah . postdoc b : i would n't know how to characterize mine either . and and so i would think i would say , i 've i 've got a mix of california and ohio . grad a : i c i think at the first level , for example , we speak the same . phd d : i do n't know . grad a : our our dialects or whatever you region are the same . postdoc b : uh - huh . grad a : but i do n't know what it is . so . phd d : well , you have a like techno - speak accent i think . grad a : a techno - speak accent ? phd d : yeah , you know ? phd e : a techno grad a : a a geek region ? phd d : well it 's i mean i you can sort of identify postdoc b : geek region . phd d : it f it 's it 's not not that that 's phd e : is different . is different . phd d : but but maybe that maybe we could leave this and see what people see what people choose and then um let them just fill in if they do n't i mean i do n't know what else we can do , cuz that 's north midland . postdoc b : i 'm wondering about a question like , `` where are you from mostly ? `` phd e : yeah . professor c : but i i 'm s i 'm now that you mentioned it though , i am really am confused by `` northern `` . phd e : yeah . postdoc b : i agree . i agree . professor c : i really am . postdoc b : i agree . professor c : i mean , if if you 're in new england , that 's north . phd e : yeah . professor c : if you 're i if you 're postdoc b : scandinavian , the minnesota area 's north . professor c : uh yeah . that 's but that 's also north midland , phd e : yeah . postdoc b : oh , @ @ . ok . professor c : right ? and and and oregon and and oregon and washington are are western , but they 're also northern . phd d : yeah . of course , that 's very different from , like , michigan , or postdoc b : mm - hmm . professor c : uh , idaho ? phd d : well there are hardly any subjects from idaho . professor c : montana ? grad a : no problem . postdoc b : just rule them out . phd d : there 's only a few people in idaho . grad a : there are hardly any subjects from `` beep `` phd e : yeah . phd d : sorry . professor c : maybe maybe we maybe we should put a little map and say `` put an x on where you 're from `` , phd d : no , that 's phd e : and is in those grad a : yeah really . phd d : we could ask where they 're from . phd e : and if you put postdoc b : it 'd be pretty simple , yeah . phd d : yeah . but - we went back to that . phd e : yeah . if you put eh the state ? grad a : well well we sort of postdoc b : where are you from mostly ? phd d : we we went we went around this and then a lot of people ended up saying that it phd e : uh - huh . mm - hmm . phd d : you know . grad a : well , i like the idea of asking `` what variety of english do you speak `` as opposed to where you 're from because th if we start asking where we 're from , again you have to start saying , `` well , is that the language you speak or is that just where you 're from ? `` phd e : yeah . phd d : right . right . phd e : yeah . professor c : let 's mm - hmm . phd d : i mean it gives us good information on where they 're from , but that does n't { comment } tell us anything grad a : and professor c : we could always ask them if they 're from phd d : well , enough about their grad a : i mean . so so i would say germany phd d : like grad a : you know am i speaking with german accent i do n't think so . postdoc b : well , see , i 'm thinking `` where are you from mostly `` phd d : right . grad a : oh , ok yeah . postdoc b : because , you know , then you have some some kind of subjective amount of time factored into it . phd e : yeah . yeah . grad a : yep . yeah , i guess i could try to put squeeze in a little map . phd e : yeah . grad a : i mean there 's not a lot of r of room professor c : i 'd say , uh , `` boston , new york city , the south and regular `` . postdoc b : well phd d : oh , i do n't know . grad a : i think of those , northern is the only one that i do n't even know what they 're meaning . postdoc b : yeah . yeah . phd e : and and um and usually here people here know what is their kind of mmm lang english language ? professor c : that 's a joke . that 's phd d : so let 's make it up . s i mean , who cares . right ? we can make up our own so we can say `` northwest `` , `` rest of west `` or something . you know . `` west `` and i mean . grad a : ye i do n't think the northwest people speak any differently than i do . phd d : it does n't even yeah , exactly . that 's not really a region . postdoc b : i professor c : `` do you come from the louisiana purchase ? `` phd d : so we could take out `` north `` `` northern `` . grad a : that that 's exactly what we 're arguing about . phd e : eh here is easy for people to know ? phd d : that 's yeah , w it 's in it 's it 's harder in america anywhere else , basically . grad a : we do n't know . phd e : because you have grad a : i mean some of them are very obvious . if you if you talk to someone speaking with southern drawl , you know . phd e : n m yeah . postdoc b : yeah , or boston . grad a : or boston , yeah . postdoc b : i ca n't do it , but phd e : or boston ? professor c : yeah . phd d : and those people , if you ask them to self - identify their accent they know . phd e : yeah . postdoc b : yeah , they do . phd d : they know very well . postdoc b : yeah i agree i agree . i agree . phd d : they know they do n't speak the same as the grad a : but is boston new england ? postdoc b : and they 're proud of it . yeah . phd d : yeah , exactly ."
