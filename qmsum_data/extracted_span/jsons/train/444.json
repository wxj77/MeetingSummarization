    "answer": "industrial designer : um we could also use wood , or titanium . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and yeah mm . project manager : works well in arizona but in edinburgh not so industrial designer : always the you but marketing : y probably not yeah . industrial designer : exactly . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . marketing : industrial designer : so i 'd say what we 're stuck with really is um the basic battery . which also makes a base station basically obsolete . we do n't need that then . um however our interface options are push-buttons . in which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . um however we 've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . and they are possible . we have an okay for scroll wheels . okay . um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i 've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an lcd into the remote control as well . this however may exclude certain um materials . if you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an lcd screen may be affected by the movement . hence we might not be able to put it in there . so um there 's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . if we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that i 've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . i do n't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . i 'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let 's have a more sophisticated chip , but that 's not up to me to decide really . so that 's for the for the scroll wheel . um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so i 'd say rather not go for for that . let 's see now . um um solar cells can not be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . but obviously that 's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , i assume right ? or is anybody still user interface : yeah . project manager : no i think i think batteries are probably the way to go . industrial designer : alright . marketing : no . hmm . industrial designer : alright . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional i assume . um um with the titanium um we can not make it a curved design . we would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much . which i assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . user interface : would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . marketing : mm . like a covering . yeah . user interface : so i do n't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic . but then where do people hold it ? project manager : yeah . user interface : just all be sort of spongy . marketing : the we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . user interface : so you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? like the ipod ? industrial designer : you can have an lcd screen . um but therefore no rubber will be used . user interface : right . industrial designer : alright ? so plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . with plastic , as i understand it , you can use any form . um latex is tricky . or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . so the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an lcd screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . or wood even . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um if you wan na make it a particular shape , use plastic . add an lcd screen , add a scroll wheel , that 'll be fine . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : or make it just push-buttons . basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . maybe not the nicest feel . or not much originality really . project manager : so the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? or the rubbery we can not ? industrial designer : with rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : but we can not add scroll wheels , and we can not add an lcd screen ."
