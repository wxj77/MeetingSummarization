    "answer": "project manager : uh that the new products we are gon na make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . and i think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . 'cause what you told is the channel selection is important . volume selection , power and teletext . marketing : yes . project manager : okay . um user interface : yeah . marketing : yes . but obviously the board tends to disagree . project manager : no we we have n't voted yet , so user interface : project manager : uh i think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well . but only if uh if it wo n't higher the the cost , because i do n't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but i do n't think it will be a problem . or is teletext a user interface : but um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . project manager : yeah . user interface : so it 's marketing : yeah , also . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . so i suggest uh marketing : i think it 'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . user interface : it 's project manager : yeah . is anybody um really against teletext ? no ? just that , that we just keep the teletext . i think that 's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . for elderly people they can think , oh i wan na have subtitles , user interface : yeah yeah . project manager : and they push the button and they get the big subtitles . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : uh that 's a good idea . project manager : um so i think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . um functionality should be few buttons , you said . i think uh that 's very important we have a few buttons . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so to keep it simple . marketing : but i do n't think that 's really an issue any more 'cause well might be . user interface : if it 's only for televi marketing : but i mean it , if it 's only for tv you 're not gon na need a lot of buttons anyway . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : you need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , user interface : yeah . marketing : volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but project manager : yeah . but do you need user interface : so we can s we can skip the display , marketing : i think if you if you only l user interface : so uh we do n't need it . project manager : but do you need the buttons for one to zero . maybe c we can user interface : uh marketing : think if you 're gon na include teletext you do . i think many people like to use that . project manager : maybe we can use uh user interface : yeah . marketing : 'cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you do n't wan na push the next channel button thirty five times . user interface : yeah . project manager : no , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? there are other ways too . just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or user interface : yeah . mm-hmm . yeah . marketing : that 's true but um i do n't think there are many tvs that can switch channels that fast . and so you would need like the tv would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . and i dunno if many channels would do have that . if many tvs have that . industrial designer : yeah . and besides that it 's um if we 're gon na focus on elderly people they 'll have to adapt . they 're not used to using scroll buttons . project manager : that 's right . industrial designer : so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : the numbers yeah . yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it 's too much we can uh reconsider it . but i think there wo n't be very much buttons . user interface : yeah . project manager : or there do n't have to be a lot . marketing : but i do n't think i think if you 're gon na make a remote control only to operate a tv , you there 's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 'cause i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a tv , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . i do n't think there 's much to be gained in that area . project manager : the number of buttons ? i think it 's very important in the in the design . marketing : yeah . project manager : you can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with marketing : that is true but i think there 's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you 're making a remote control only for to operate only the tv . project manager : to operate only the tv yeah . marketing : 'cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a tv there 's simply not a lot of buttons required . there 's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do n't have a lot of buttons either . so i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . project manager : 'kay . so we can marketing : that would that would cost a a big marketing expedition project manager : yeah . that 's right . marketing : which was one of the arguments to make it only for the tv because we did n't have the time to market a lot . project manager : yeah . so you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . user interface : project manager : uh uh like other functions . instead of f of less buttons . marketing : maybe . well yeah i think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and but i do n't think we should spend very much time in that . project manager : mm . no . do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ? industrial designer : it should be possible yes . if it 's not too fancy . project manager : 'cause it can be industrial designer : and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : because i think that 's uh that 's a good advantage point as well . if we have a fancy-looking docking station or very that 's a nice requirement . docking station . marketing : industrial designer : so we 're just gon na focus on the extras ? project manager : i think so . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah i think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a project manager : yeah . marketing : like to have extra in a new remote control . project manager : that 's a good point . um you said they easily get lost as well . marketing : yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . project manager : yeah . so maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . marketing : yeah that was what i suggested . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . marketing : you have it on project manager : yeah . marketing : you have it 's on some phones too , which have a docking station . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing . project manager : yeah . so marketing : so you know where it is . project manager : audio signal should be possible as well . i think it 's not too expensive . uh another point is the lcd screen . um i do n't know if that will rise the cost too much , because industrial designer : y i um i think we 'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause project manager : yeah . it will be too much as well . industrial designer : it 's uh marketing : i think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we 're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . which would tell you what it does . project manager : yeah . marketing : and it would n't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , project manager : based . user interface : okay . yeah . marketing : but project manager : just the lcd . oh just the normal screen . marketing : just a small screen project manager : that 's a good idea . so marketing : with two project manager : some extra info . feedback . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . i think that 's a good idea as well . user interface : yeah . marketing : but i dunno if that would project manager : as the small screen . marketing : that would fit into the costs . project manager : extra button info . i think that should be possible as well . um let 's see what did we say . mm . more . should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . few buttons , we talked about that . docking station , lcd . um general functions yeah . 'kay . and default materials . i think that 's a good idea as well , because um elderly people do n't mind if it 's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . user interface : project manager : so that does n't really matter . so i think we nee marketing : i think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters . project manager : uh let 's um specify the target group . because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . because i think what we 're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . user interface : mm . yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : uh what do we want ? if we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can marketing : i think project manager : target the real elderly people . marketing : i think that would be a if we should do something like that it would be a , i think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company . project manager : yeah . marketing : and i think , i think there would be a good market for it . project manager : so that 's the marketing : if we 're able to really bring an innovative product . project manager : now you 're talking about sixty to eighty for example . marketing : yeah the really project manager : yeah . sixty . marketing : but i 'd have to look into that a little more . project manager : okay . and different cultures . are we industrial designer : well i do n't think they have different television sets uh project manager : okay . industrial designer : in uh every country . 'cause project manager : we 've got five minutes left just now . user interface : so 'kay . project manager : small warning . marketing : 'kay . and with uh the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . you could i think we n it would be a lot easier to project manager : should marketing : adapt it to different cultures . project manager : yeah . in different languages , you know . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : or you have to put a language button in it , user interface : right . project manager : but that will be a bit unnecessary i think . user interface : no . yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's better to put it on different markets with it all . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . so industrial designer : yeah . project manager : that 's the the target . uh then a few small things ."
