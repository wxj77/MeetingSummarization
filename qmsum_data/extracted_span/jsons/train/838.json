    "answer": "industrial designer : yeah 'kay . project manager : you want me to get your slide show up ? industrial designer : yeah yeah sure . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : thank you . project manager : and you are number three ? industrial designer : number two , project manager : number two . industrial designer : yeah . yeah exactly . project manager : okay . okay . industrial designer : uh can you make it uh full screen please ? project manager : mm-hmm . yep . industrial designer : no , it 's like a well you you have to press here . the cup cup shape here ? marketing : project manager : yeah yeah , uh-huh . industrial designer : the thir third . project manager : there , mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah exactly . uh so today i 'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . um can you go to the next sli slide please ? marketing : okay . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : the metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . it takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . it should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it 's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a tv or a air conditioner , something like that so . uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is . it should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal , marketing : signal . industrial designer : and the tv it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control user interface : receive . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh so uh i think it 's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices . user interface : multi-purpose . project manager : yo and it 's marketing : yeah well that 's already been eliminated by management , so we 're off the hook . project manager : yeah but it 's so . industrial designer : uh yeah . um . so uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . so uh you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh tv or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there 's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and tv can perform the actions . marketing : mm okay . industrial designer : so can you go to the next slide please ? marketing : okay . industrial designer : uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch . and uh bulbs . like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the tv is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : then it will be like if you switch on your tv through anoth another source , not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : maybe we can have that . whenever the tv is on , remote controller will have a light . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and then uh infrared bulbs . um this is like uh when it is dark . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah , mm-hmm . industrial designer : and battery , there should be a battery for power supply , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and a chip , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and wires connecting all chips , which is uh lights , everything , project manager : yeah . user interface : okay . industrial designer : so there should be wires . and uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape . user interface : to keep the remote ? yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : case . user interface : a case holder . a holder remote holder . industrial designer : yeah , holder . project manager : holder , yeah , mm-hmm ."
