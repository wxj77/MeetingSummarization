    "answer": "ms. christine normandin ( saint-jean , bq ) : mr.chair , there are times when quebec and the provinces are not just two solitudes , but they get along and speak as one , such as when the time comes to tell the government to mind its own business . on reading section91 of the constitution act , 1982 , which sets out the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government , nowhere do i find that the federal government must meddle by attaching conditions to health transfers . it is quebec and the provinces that hire the medical personnel , doctors , nurses and caretakers . it is quebec and the provinces that are responsible for purchasing the necessary equipment . it is quebec and the provinces that know what is happening on the ground and what their needs are . will the government do the only thing within its authority , which is to take the cheque , sign it and put it in the mail ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i thank the hon . member for her question . we fully understand the importance of federal support for the provinces , especially in our national fight against the coronavirus . i agree with the hon . member that we must give financial support to the provinces , including quebec absolutely . i would also like to point out the importance of the support of the canadian armed forces , who are doing an important and excellent job in quebec and ontario today , right now . ms. christine normandin : mr.chair , i am glad to see that there is recognition of the importance of transferring this money . my question is whether it can be transferred unconditionally ; that 's what i 'm asking . there 's a state of emergency . in the past , we have seen that it takes a long time to negotiate conditions with the federal government . we saw it in the case of the quebec city tramway , and we are still seeing it now in the case of transfers for housing in quebec , for which there is no agreement and , therefore , no transfer of money . will the federal government send the money free of conditions ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , the hon . member said in her first question that the only thing the federal government had to do on health care was to sign the cheques . i ca n't agree because , today , at this time , at the request of the premier of quebec , the men and women of the canadian armed forces are in quebec today ; they 're there to save the lives of seniors the chair : we now return to ms.normandin . ms. christine normandin : it was indeed at quebec 's request . what i 'm saying is that , at present , the provinces are unanimously asking that there be no conditions . it 's urgent that the money be transferred . the federal government 's job here is to sign the cheque and send it to the provinces . the government 's job is also to make parliament work . this is where there should be negotiations so that we can work , among other things , to send money to people living with disabilities , to make sure we fight cerb fraud and to make sure that court time limits are effective in the current crisis . can the government focus on the issue in order to respect the provinces and transfer money for health care ? hon . chrystia freeland : i thank the hon . member for her question , mr.chair . i agree with the hon . member that the women and men of the canadian armed forces are in quebec today at the request of the province of quebec . that said , i hope that the hon . member will agree with me that being there for quebec 's seniors , that saving the lives of quebec 's seniors , is much more than simply signing cheques . i am very proud of the work the women and men of the canadian armed forces are doing . i think we all should thank these people who are working for canada , for quebec , and who are doing an important and excellent job . ms. christine normandin : mr.chair , i think the deputy prime minister misunderstood me when i was talking about the importance of acting quickly . negotiations between the government and the provinces take an awfully long time because the federal government decides to place conditions where there should n't be any . right now , the only important thing is to transfer the money quickly so that it can be used in our hospitals and our long-term care facilities , where the need is desperate . quebec and the provinces know exactly what their needs are ."
