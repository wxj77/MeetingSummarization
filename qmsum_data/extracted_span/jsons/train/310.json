    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about details of button design and location function ?",
    "answer": "project manager : so . to go on from here . um we have to decide exactly what we 're going to do with the remote . before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we 're going this is the design we 're gon na try and get , this is how we 're gon na make ourselves look unique . do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry , we 're gon na go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it 's now being used to manoeuvre round the lcd . user interface : mm yeah . yeah , i think that 's industrial designer : we 're just saying volume . should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ? user interface : yeah . project manager : we could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume , user interface : for volume . project manager : and marketing : but we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most . project manager : okay . marketing : um , power is used like once per hour , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : that 's by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that 's like fourteen , project manager : vol volume selection okay , yep , marketing : and volume selection . project manager : the teletext we 're gambling with , and we 're gon na say it 's dead , the way of the dodo marketing : no , yeah , okay okay . yeah , um project manager : so we well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , lcd , and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you 're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? so we 're having very very few buttons involved , user interface : actually how project manager : but navigation around a menu for most things . user interface : actually i would say maybe two two function buttons , the y we 're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . i mean certainly something i 've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay . project manager : okay . user interface : or vice versa . project manager : okay . user interface : and that 's really irritating . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : the o the o the other dis design constraint i think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , um , so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb . project manager : okay . so um we 're actually that sounds like a rough idea . do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? industrial designer : yeah , think so . project manager : do you mind looking ? marketing : um , i think because it 's so small it might be an uh i mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that project manager : the ability to locate it again . marketing : yeah . project manager : so that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the tv , just so that it says find me , and what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base . industrial designer : light bulb as well , user interface : oh . so so project manager : sorry ? user interface : a small speaker you mean . project manager : some speaker , marketing : speaker project manager : sorry , yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and a light bulb ? no . to flash . no . user interface : project manager : um industrial designer : nah , you 'd see it anyway , if you hear it . project manager : e us we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate marketing : w those little key-rings have both , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : th e the true fact , considering the cost of an l_e_d_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . marketing : so yeah . project manager : the l_e_d_s can be surprisingly bright now . marketing : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : mm-hmm . blue ones particularly . project manager : um . so user interface : plus that 's a nice wee design touch . marketing : yeah . project manager : by the sounds of it , with what we 're suggesting so far , your design um the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : because we 're only going to have a very few key and you 've got you know a small lcd , joystick , e i think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : um if you could look into what we 've suggested so far , the feasibility of um small transmitter , um and such , maybe if an lcd screen requires too much power , or such . ebenezer , um , marketing expert marketing : well i can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , i guess that 's gon na be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface , right . you want the stuff . project manager : yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we 've taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile . marketing : okay . project manager : i do n't know how easy that will be within the time frame , marketing : okay . project manager : but could be something we could maybe look into . marketing : mm-hmm . sure . sure . project manager : okay . um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? anything that they think has been missed out . bit of a wide open question there of course . feel free to email me if you think that uh we 've screwed something up and wan na get it rectified as soon as possible . marketing : sure . 'kay . yeah . project manager : right . industrial designer : so i should just look at um the speaker , the speaker and an l_e_d_ . user interface : project manager : speaker and l_e_d_ for locating , um , industrial designer : and marketing : transmitter . industrial designer : yeah , and a transmitter . project manager : transmitter user interface : actually one one wee thought about that . um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television . project manager : getting the external power source , yep , that 's quite true . um , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well i 'd say . user interface : yeah . project manager : the electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so that 's good . user interface : mm-hmm . you know i think project manager : 'kay . user interface : i mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we 'll have that , save us the bother , then that 's you know vast amounts of sales . quite quickly . project manager : oh , one thing that we 've almost not talked about at all , my apologies for that , um , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here , um it 's , industrial designer : fashion . project manager : i 'm pointing at my laptop , what in god real reaction , and such . so um industrial designer : the slogan is project manager : oh , sorry . industrial designer : yeah , the slogan 's we put the fashion in electronics , is n't it ? project manager : my apologies . no it could well be , i 've probably missed that . um , i think that 's l almost the last minute thing industrial designer : 's also look cool . project manager : we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top . so i 'm not too concerned a that we have n't gone into depth about that . but it might be something you could consider when you 're thinking about shapes ? user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : in fact we might like to put a slogan on , and um possibly the two r_s to signify the company . rather than real reaction . user interface : mm-hmm . mm . yeah . i thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button . project manager : sounds good . user interface : ."
