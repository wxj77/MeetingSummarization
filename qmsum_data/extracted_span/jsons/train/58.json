    "answer": "project manager : um speech recognition i take it user interface : industrial designer : oh it 's project manager : i do n't , i 've i know of no products um that use speech recognition well . industrial designer : they 're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . you could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh b_b_c_ one and it goes to that channel . project manager : really ? industrial designer : yeah , it did n't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . they mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to b_b_c_ one . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for b_b_c_ two on b_b_c_ one 'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . industrial designer : right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you 'd be watching the tv and then all of a sudden it 'd it 'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , project manager : mm . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but if you can work around that that noise problem user interface : 'kay . project manager : uh-huh . user interface : well what about industrial designer : user interface : this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that 's built into the tv um that you can press and it 'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we ca n't hear or something project manager : ah , that 's a good idea . user interface : um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . industrial designer : right . project manager : so like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . user interface : if you find if y industrial designer : right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : what you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the tv speaker , or not a remo i 'm sorry , a microphone by the tv speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you ca n't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their tvs . user interface : mm . yeah , that 's the only thing , yeah . industrial designer : but yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the tv speaker project manager : that we should just stick on , yeah . industrial designer : which user interface : that comes with our remote control . industrial designer : right , and then the remote control would know um what 's being produced by the television . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : and that 's a sort of basic r_f_ kind of frequency so it 'll be cheap . industrial designer : right , right . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : right , right . um . yeah that 's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . if you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you do n't even need to find it . you just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the tv on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it 's within you know , within hearing range . and uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you 've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . project manager : uh-huh . user interface : that could also be built into the tv though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : well , hopefully we 're uh we 're ahead of the curve . project manager : it might do us out of a job . user interface : yeah , okay . project manager : um okay . i like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . um so i think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , so i th user interface : and the expense . project manager : yeah and expense and the time ."
