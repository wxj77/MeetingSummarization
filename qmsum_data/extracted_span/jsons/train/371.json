    "answer": "user interface : industrial designer : okay . yeah . that 's okay . that 's okay . marketing : industrial designer : okay . project manager : am i starting now ? anytime ? oh sorry . 'kay , um . alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . and um i hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . user interface : project manager : um , and um , i 'll be taking minutes on this one , and um being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting is n't very necessary for uh myself , because it 'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . um , so , the first presentation we 'll be looking at is poppy 's presentation . and , um so , sorry ? so , um , take it away poppy . industrial designer : okay . um , do i need to project manager : it 's , it 's plugged in . so , um industrial designer : plugged in . user interface : f_ eight , w . function f_ eight . industrial designer : f_ okay . function f_ eight . sorry about this guys . project manager : no problem . industrial designer : 'kay . is on . right . okay . i will take this time just to apologise . user interface : industrial designer : i , i only , uh , received my emails later on . 'cause i was too busy carried away doing my own thing , marketing : industrial designer : which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . user interface : industrial designer : but there we go . project manager : i 'm sure it 's fine . industrial designer : um , so i was looking at how we 're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . and it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . they do n't need to actually manually touch the television set . so , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . um , from uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there 're certain points that will make our product unique . um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um genevieve 's idea . so we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . and we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we 're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . a automatically , um lights up at first touch . or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . um , also we could use um an alarm . so if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : um , so that would work . um , oop . go back there . um , another thing i think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . um , from previous researches i 've carried out on other projects , um we 've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : so they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . so , for example , a screw that 's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . so um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . so , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and i think that would be very important for products now . especially 'cause there 's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious . project manager : right , um , one question . this , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ? industrial designer : um and then yeah . yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . and that 's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . i mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it 's the product 's responsibility to get rid of what they 've made . um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gon na wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . something like the case , if it 's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . project manager : mm-hmm . would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? or would we contribute to another group ? industrial designer : you could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . for a certain percentage at least . project manager : alright . industrial designer : not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , project manager : okay . this sounds like a really great idea . industrial designer : but project manager : one thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : um , so we 'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . you would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive . industrial designer : well i the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they do n't need to be manually de um deconstructed . like , you do n't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . because of this , their properties are smart material . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : all you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves . project manager : alright . we 'll still have to investigate the financial implications . industrial designer : so i suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but project manager : alright . i like the environmental approach . um , we 'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well . industrial designer : yeah . okay . um also there is um components . this 'll be how it uh will actually work . but i have n't put this plan together yet . project manager : i 'm sorry , could you industrial designer : there we go project manager : those were um industrial designer : . sorry , should i go back . this would actually show the circuit diagram . although i have n't come up with the final circuit yet . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so i just put all those components in . project manager : so those are what , um , we 'll c construct the remote . those are all the industrial designer : yeah . i it just shows what sort of energy source . it could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . um , an ' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . project manager : alright . great . industrial designer : okay ? so , now is it f_ eight again to escape ? or escape ? there we go . okay . project manager : alright . thank you very much . and , um , the next presenter will be tara . industrial designer : thank you . user interface : industrial designer : there you go tara . user interface : thanks . can you see ? marketing : oh , user interface : do you think is it uh , function eight yeah ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : function f_ eight . marketing : function f_ eight . project manager : function f_ eight . sorry . industrial designer : the one at the top . user interface : oh right . okay . marketing : that looks right . project manager : yeah . user interface : okay . i 'm the user um user interface designer . uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . um , in this case it 's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . by taking inspiration from other similar designs , we 'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . there 're two functional design options . a multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . and a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . marketing : i 'm sorry , what was that last one . multifunctional and user interface : sorry . um , a single function just for the television itself . marketing : ch oh , i see . user interface : yeah . um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . a single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . marketing : 'kay . user interface : um , i think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it 's easier to use . it 'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . and less functions would have to be included . so it would be cheaper to make . and probably more sellable just because it 's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . does anyone have any questions ? marketing : so as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? user interface : well , it 's just that , when we 're creating it , we 're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . marketing : right . user interface : and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , marketing : d_v_d_s and v_c_r_ ? user interface : yeah , project manager : right . marketing : okay . user interface : other entertainment devices . project manager : does everyone agree with this ? does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? industrial designer : um , i was just wondering about the , what , what genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . and that would probably , um , i d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . i suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : and limit the design . do you think ? marketing : yeah , i think i agree with the single design thing for now , because we 're trying to do so much , that if we 're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it 's also multi also multifunctional , um , we 're gon na go over budget for one thing . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . that 's true . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . and with this we 'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : we 'll have more money to go into the design side of it . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . yeah . project manager : alright . sounds great . marketing : mm , 'kay . project manager : alright , well , um , marketing : project manager : are you ready for your presentation genevieve ? marketing : yes i am . project manager : fabulous . except you 're not hooked up to the user interface : marketing : i 'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready . project manager : great . marketing : okay . okay . oh . i just lost my microphone . project manager : no problem , marketing : just a moment . project manager : we can marketing : okay . so i 'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . um , and i 'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? the functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . um , so what i 'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . um , i 've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . and i 'll show you my findings . oh , and firstly i wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . so i think that should be our priority here . um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . not just in electronic fashion . so that it 's something that fits in the household . project manager : i 'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ? marketing : um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who 's famous , what tv shows are being watched , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um , to influence our remote control . okay , so the findings . um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . which is a , quite a significant number . industrial designer : marketing : um , the other twenty five percent did n't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . project manager : i 'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . you mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ? marketing : yeah , they 're willing , they 're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . project manager : okay . marketing : as opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . industrial designer : mm . yeah . marketing : um , so it is something that people care about . it 's not , it 's not ignored in the household . um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : they 're you know thumb-masters . um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . that a very small amount . thought that was interesting . project manager : alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . industrial designer : mm . the single function . project manager : and another thing with um lots of surfing , we 'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : because i find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they 're printed on the button . industrial designer : yeah that 's a good point . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : and actually to go with that , i 'm gon na give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they 're used . and uh how important the uh users find them . so the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . hopefully the person 's not turning on and off the tv . um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . so people wan na be able to turn on the tv with the remote control . um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . industrial designer : marketing : that 's a huge amount . this is the most important button . um , so obviously when commercials come on they 're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that 's not gon na run down . relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . and it 's used on average four times an hour . not as much as channel selection , but still significant . um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . relevance is two . screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . um , and relevance of one point five . we 're getting to specific statistics here . teletext , um , now i 'm not too clear on what that is . i do n't know if you can help me . flipping pages . user interface : it 's um marketing : is that industrial designer : it 's like the news . or like information . user interface : it has tv has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the project manager : it 's um industrial designer : and what 's on . marketing : so like a running banner , underneath project manager : no it 's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up . user interface : no , li yeah . project manager : i have n't used it before user interface : yeah . project manager : but industrial designer : it 's like user interface : and you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it 'll come up . industrial designer : it 's like very basic internet . sort of , marketing : okay . user interface : very basic internet , yeah . industrial designer : um user interface : but you have marketing : okay . like tells you the weather , and user interface : yeah . but you have no interaction back with it , you know . marketing : okay . user interface : like the internet you can send emails and you 've no interaction . industrial designer : yeah , it 's just information that um , like television timetables , what 's on , what 's on now , what 's on next , on every channel , and marketing : right . user interface : yeah . marketing : alright . well i guess i 'm not with it , because i was n't but it 's , it 's being used fourteen times an hour . um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . so it looks like something that we 're gon na want to do some research on and include on our remote control . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um , channel settings . zero point zero one times an hour . relevance of three . channel settings . user interface : uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? marketing : p sorry . changing the channels ? user interface : tuning them in at the very start . you know if you get a new tv set , you tune in all the channels , industrial designer : to get the right reception and picture , i suppose . user interface : do you th do you think ? marketing : oh , okay . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah . okay . um , so it 's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . okay . um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . remote controls are often lost somewhere . so that was already discussed by poppy . how we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . so it should be very user-friendly , you know . people know what to do very quickly . um , remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ . industrial designer : repetitive strain injury . user interface : repeti uh . industrial designer : i think . marketing : is that what it is ? people with arthritis and such ? project manager : that 's rather sad . industrial designer : user interface : industrial designer : marketing : um , maybe our industrial designer : oh , i 'm guessing that 's what it is . i 'm not user interface : yeah , yeah . i think it is . marketing : designers can look into that . um , buttons that do n't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . industrial designer : mm . yeah . marketing : but we 'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . that 's a problem . industrial designer : yeah . it is . marketing : okay . did you guys uh get that one down ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : um okay , here 's some ideas for you . a large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . so i 'll show you some numbers here . um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . um , that would , are willing to pay extra . so i guess we 're gon na have to figure out what age group we 're , we 're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wan na look into . and if we have the budget for it . um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it . project manager : i agree with um if we 're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . um , financially and and functionally . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably wo n't be as concerned . marketing : so that , that 's a whole other field of research . i do n't know if it 'd be , if we 'd still have a remote , or if you 're talking to your television and saying change channel . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um and depending on how many members you have in households . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so it m it may be too complicated for us , but it 's something to keep in mind anyway . project manager : yeah . and something that might further complicate it is that the tv makes noise itself . marketing : right . project manager : wonder if it would have user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and if there was conversation in the room at the same time , project manager : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : although in theory it does n't tend to be when you 're watching television , project manager : industrial designer : but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . project manager : yeah . if we 're looking for a simplistic design , if marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : we need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design . industrial designer : yeah . mm . project manager : um , because if , if it is then i think voice , um voice-activated marketing : it looks like project manager : yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : because if people can activate the television with their voice then they wo n't be using a , they wo n't be talking into a remote , i 'm sure . marketing : it 'd be like the ultimate remote . um okay . and th the last thing here was a , an lcd screen . so , i mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . not practical . um an lcd screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this powerpoint is working . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so that you do n't have so many buttons to deal with . project manager : um , i do n't know what an lcd screen is . marketing : oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . s or like um user interface : mobile phone . yeah . marketing : yeah . or like an alarm clock . you 'd have an lcd versus just a , a normal clock . industrial designer : what , what would appear on the screen ? project manager : i have no idea still . i 'm sorry . marketing : oh just like an electronic screen . as opposed to just buttons . there would be like a little , like on project manager : oh , on the remote . okay . marketing : yeah . like on the top of a cellphone , the the little lcd screen . project manager : yeah . marketing : um , now that 's , i , i dunno exactly what exactly we 'd put on there . i guess the channel that you 're on , the v the volume setting . user interface : yeah . could it it it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . but that would probably be industrial designer : like linked in with the teletext , user interface : yeah . that would be good , yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . user interface : yeah . might be quite expensive to do that though . industrial designer : mm , yeah . could be . user interface : marketing : well i guess that 's something we can all take back to our respective research . project manager : right . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . um , i think our priority really should be unique design . um , we want something that people want in their home . every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . so the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um , i th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . user interface : marketing : so if we 're , if we 're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product project manager : marketing : um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . i mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . but if we wan na make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend on a remote control . like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they 're just starting out marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and , yeah . marketing : right . and we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . i mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah i 'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that 's three months allowance . user interface : yeah . project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : um , so i i think , i think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . user interface : early twenties , that 's the kind of age group . project manager : yeah . and if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , user interface : twenties . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : i 'm sure that something like an lcd screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . industrial designer : yeah . complicated jus complicating things even fo mm . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : alright . industrial designer : okay . marketing : okay . that 's it for the market research . project manager : okay . before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like , i 've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . um , for one thing , because having controls with d_v_d_ , v_c_r_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . um , we 've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . which is good as , as we 've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . um , for many reasons . so um we have that decision sort of made for us . another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . and so uh we wo n't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . industrial designer : can i just interrupt ? would you like to plug in your marketing : yeah . maybe we can do the project manager : okay , sure . industrial designer : have you got a powerpoint or not ? project manager : yeah i do . i 'm looking at looking at it right now . industrial designer : okay . thanks . marketing : there you go . project manager : thank you . marketing : oh , come back screen . project manager : marketing : hmm . industrial designer : were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ? project manager : um , well , i mean we do n't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used . industrial designer : okay . yeah . okay . project manager : alright , and another thing . this is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wan na create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . so , um , all the remote controls must have our um we 'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . industrial designer : right . yeah . project manager : so , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . industrial designer : yeah . okay . project manager : um , it does n't have to be the colour of our um of our company industrial designer : just project manager : but , another thing is that , um industrial designer : project manager : we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . um , i 'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting i , i was n't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . industrial designer : okay . work on that . marketing : it 's probably r_ r_r_ in yellow . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : the little r_ r_ yellow thing ? okay . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , i think . project manager : real reaction ? okay . um , yes , those are the changes . um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . i 'm just going to look at my notes for a second . um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . so , um , we already know that it 'll just be for the television . industrial designer : okay . project manager : it 'll it wo n't have teletext . but um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , genevieve . marketing : okay , so i are we going to write off the lcd option ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : is that how most people feel about that ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : okay . so no lcd , no teletext , and no voice recognition . user interface : i think it would be annoying though if i do n't use teletext that much , but if it was on your tv , you 'd want to be able to use it , if project manager : yeah , but another thing is that if we 're reaching an international crowd , um , i know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext , so it 'd be really superfluous . user interface : you 'd yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : so is it just industrial designer : yeah . marketing : never heard of it . user interface : okay . alright . project manager : yeah . i do n't know about other countries besides the u_k_ . user interface : right . project manager : do you know if anywhere else has it ? industrial designer : i do n't know . user interface : i do n't know . industrial designer : more research required , i think . user interface : i do n't know . project manager : alright . industrial designer : but if was it a management decision that we 're having project manager : it was a management decision , industrial designer : okay . project manager : so it 's , it 's pretty much out of our hands at this point . industrial designer : so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . user interface : okay then . project manager : 'kay . so , i guess we 're looking at something rather simple . marketing : um , well i guess , just from my findings it looks like we wan na minimise buttons . industrial designer : 'kay . minimal marketing : and the what was the word they used ? f findability is important . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : yeah . i think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . industrial designer : yeah okay . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : 'cause i 'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . the same signalling . project manager : the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . industrial designer : i mean project manager : it 's not that expensive to do . industrial designer : or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . like you just a , a buzz or something . project manager : yeah . yeah . okay . i like that idea . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? 'cause uh is n't our remote control for all tvs , so industrial designer : if user interface : you 'd ha industrial designer : do you mean the the link between the user interface : yeah , with the button that you pressed . project manager : yeah . the button industrial designer : well , if the button was actually on user interface : yeah . industrial designer : oh , yeah . project manager : minor detail there . user interface : c 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one tv set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . industrial designer : maybe yeah , yeah . project manager : yeah , it would have t industrial designer : maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : obviously something small that 's yeah , that 's a good point . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . then it would n't , it probably would n't be able to use it would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control i guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah , okay . user interface : would it need a battery then ? project manager : maybe , um industrial designer : pr probably . project manager : probably , i mean . industrial designer : unless it could be project manager : that 's your department you 'll have to sort that out . user interface : industrial designer : okay . um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the tv 's supplied from . i mean the power for the tv . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , you 'll have to industrial designer : so , mm , more research into that one . project manager : yeah , you 'll have to investi do some research on that , user interface : industrial designer : yeah . project manager : alright ? great . um , alright , and i 'm sure that , um um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . is everyone interested in that ? marketing : on the buttons ? user interface : i i like the light up suggestion . i think that would be better . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : 'cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it does n't user interface : i would go for marketing : it could it could be a tactile thing as well . um right , if w if we 're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . and there 's something on it . s you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . industrial designer : like a raised marketing : um , and i do n't know what we could do for , for channels . s user interface : well just the numbers could be embossed , could n't it ? like raised . marketing : the numbers themselves . user interface : yeah . could be raised . marketing : but then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing . user interface : just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ? industrial designer : yeah marketing : yeah . i just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . i 'm not sure . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : that 's true . project manager : but i mean industrial designer : and also y , uh heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : um , so like big b um buttons , for people you are visually impaired . the glow-in-the-dark or light up wo n't make any difference anyway . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so like you say tactile might be better , because it 'd be more available to everybody . user interface : that , i think that 's good , yeah . project manager : yeah . could we somehow we could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : 'cause i d i do n't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : no , it 's not these days . user interface : no , i would n't say so . marketing : industrial designer : i mean , it 's quite easily accessible . project manager : yeah . marketing : i guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you 're s and then it goes , industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : that 's good yeah that a good idea . marketing : so if , if you 're like changing the volume during a movie . i know , i 'm thinking of mostly when you 're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and you do n't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there 's suddenly an explosion , and it 's gon na wake up the baby . user interface : yeah . marketing : um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it lights up for industrial designer : yeah . user interface : that , yeah , that 's a good idea . marketing : on self timer . industrial designer : so self-timed lighting . project manager : alright we have five minutes left marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um , i project manager : um , for the meeting , but i think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . um , what was i missed the last moment , reading that . what were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? marketing : oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell you know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it 's touched again . project manager : mm . so it could be any button that would be pressed . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . industrial designer : so , self-timed marketing : so if you have all the lights off in your living room , you 'll , you 'll temporarily see it . project manager : yeah . marketing : because usually you 're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay , so user interface : yeah . marketing : so project manager : that 's probably feasible . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? do we have to kind of decide what we 're gon na do with this . industrial designer : i think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah , okay . industrial designer : and i think that 's un unique as well . user interface : yeah . for visually impaired , yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i mean , i have n't seen that . and as you 're saying like numbers can wear off if they 're just sort of like painted on , you know printed . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah , yeah . and it could , if it 's that softer rubber material it 'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no industrial designer : durable . project manager : what 's it called , r_s_i_ , what was it that we were talking about ? industrial designer : oh yeah . yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : oh right , the project manager : yeah instead of like hard buttons . industrial designer : repetitive strain injury . project manager : okay . um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? user interface : if project manager : like should we do both ? or we can have one or the other ? because it might , for , for our design purposes , i mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with . marketing : i was gon na say , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : exactly . it the it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . project manager : yeah . marketing : it 's kind of like eighties neon-style . industrial designer : yeah , and we could marketing : um , whereas we 're trying to be trendy and fashionable . industrial designer : yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , marketing : so industrial designer : which could like link in with the company colours . like it could be blue or green or yellow , user interface : project manager : right . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : or like we 've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so project manager : right . alright . so we 've decided on lighting up things . user interface : i was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um real reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . industrial designer : yeah . every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : or , or the , whate project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : but with the same thing , i mean . if you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . marketing : that 's true . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . okay . project manager : is are you okay with that ? okay . cool . user interface : yeah . project manager : um alright . so i think that um that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions . industrial designer : is project manager : and now it 's up to designing . and um making sure that this can be feasible . and do you have anything marketing : what um project manager : do you have anything to say ? marketing : oh sorry . yeah well , i was just gon na throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . so i i dunno if there 's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . i dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . um industrial designer : okay . like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . user interface : oh yeah . interchangeable thing ? marketing : yeah , project manager : like an ipod or something ? user interface : that would be good . industrial designer : yeah , or marketing : exactly , like an ipod . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : exactly . industrial designer : okay . marketing : or , or like mobile ph . project manager : like a cellphone ? yeah . marketing : and i dunno if we 'd want to go with like tv show themes or something . like a bart simpson faceplate . user interface : yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . marketing : but industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : y could buy extra marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : accessories . marketing : exactly . you could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . industrial designer : person user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . well , that 's great . user interface : that 's a good idea . yeah . project manager : yeah . i think that we should incorporate that . industrial designer : interchangeable . project manager : 'cause that would n't be very expensive at all . industrial designer : um , als project manager : you 'd just get one mould , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : throw some plastic in it , you know . industrial designer : interchan and also possible i mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain tv shows , or project manager : yeah . well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . user interface : oh yeah . marketing : right . project manager : so , if it takes off then we 'll , we 'll , we 'll try that out . industrial designer : yeah . but if we , there is yeah . we could um , the environmental factor , we did n't bring that up again . project manager : right . marketing : right . project manager : we 'll have to do more research . like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it 'll look . um , does it need to be reached a de industrial designer : yeah . project manager : do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? industrial designer : um , i 've project manager : because we need to investigate the financial implications . industrial designer : okay . marketing : project manager : okay . is it industrial designer : let 's project manager : does it need to be uh decided on now ? or should we industrial designer : i think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then . project manager : okay . good . alright then . anyone else have anything more to say before we close ? alright , well . let 's have lunch and we 'll discuss this later . user interface : okay . marketing : project manager : alright ?"
