    "answer": "industrial designer : yep . so i will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight euros actually , right , seven eight euros , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it 's like a surf board . marketing : mm 'kay . industrial designer : and you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf tv , maybe the web , and uh it 's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff . marketing : project manager : user interface : project manager : user interface : or browse . industrial designer : and also it 's not too far from um a mobile . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so people are used to that kind of shape , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : right . do n't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we do n't take user interface : now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . industrial designer : yeah . so here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i yeah . industrial designer : yeah l_a_ l_a_ l_e_d_ , user interface : l_e_d_ . industrial designer : the on-off button , in red . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : here would be the volume . on the on the left , marketing : oh yeah . project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : okay , so user interface : mm-hmm , hmm . industrial designer : easy to turn on t and off . and um so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh matthew . user interface : also so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : so you can go up and down the channels , marketing : yeah . user interface : uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . industrial designer : how can you change from v_c_r_ to uh tv , by the way ? user interface : oh no no no , this is a single this this is a model with just the tv one . industrial designer : okay yeah . yeah yeah . project manager : ah , okay . user interface : no no just sorry , this is a standard tv one , we are not talking about that . so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : the extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . and the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . actually . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay so project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : it 's it 's t a very basic remote then , it 's only user interface : it 's a very basic minimal thing project manager : yeah . yeah . yeah . user interface : which you can which is which is also available in the market , actually that 's what it that it i industrial designer : user interface : and would cost us to build it about eight euros . industrial designer : seven , eight , ei eight euros . project manager : exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so this one model marketing : can i see ? user interface : and uh yeah . sure . marketing : thanks . okay i like the volume control , that 's good . industrial designer : user interface : th this is a magic one but i know we do n't want to talk about that , marketing : user interface : you know like industrial designer : user interface : uh i i i it is a very futuristic , it 's like uh it 's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . project manager : marketing : uh-huh . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : marketing : so it does n't actually have buttons . user interface : so that uh then what we look t marketing : did you wan na see ? user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah no you can carry on , user interface : this is a model , project manager : i just look how it feels all . user interface : yeah . project manager : yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : just i 'm industrial designer : yeah actually , yeah . project manager : i really want to talk to it . marketing : it wo n't talk back . project manager : but . industrial designer : project manager : so but but continue with your uh user interface : uh so well project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys , but do n't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . marketing : right . user interface : and so they have more space actually marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and uh it 's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo industrial designer : play , pause . user interface : yeah s pause or stop , and uh then uh you can uh you have a lcd display , here project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it 's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it project manager : from d_v_d_ player to television or something . industrial designer : exactly yeah . to audio and to video on demand . user interface : yeah . i really can change it , so instead of having many switches , y marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yes and and and then you get feedback via the lcd yeah . user interface : the lcd can display what is that on that , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here , industrial designer : this is the orange button , the microphone . user interface : or in the button th here , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . industrial designer : an yeah . user interface : and here is a small l_e_d_ which is like blinking one , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as i was talking earlier project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : okay . and uh well then we have a cover basically , basically you do n't need much of the time this , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover project manager : mm . yeah industrial designer : crazy dis designer , user interface : you know . industrial designer : okay . user interface : design enter . project manager : but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the lcd screen ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah yeah . user interface : yeah . it 's basically to do that . project manager : but but the lcd screen i mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature industrial designer : yeah . user interface : project manager : which should n't be should n't be user interface : actually when you are watching the tv , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , industrial designer : oh actually well . project manager : that th that 's true . user interface : you know , uh you want to uh and this gives a protection to the lcd actually , giving a cover to that actually . gives a protection because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . yes . yes , more robust . user interface : it 's more robust that way . uh yeah . project manager : yes okay . user interface : and you have very good chances industrial designer : it 's low weight . you have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so the the cost is actually a bit more , it 's uh it 's it 's sixteen francs . user interface : it sixteen euros . project manager : okay . industrial designer : sixteen euros sorry . marketing : so it 's well outside the budget then . user interface : industrial designer : then it 's out of budget . but the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . and they say basically that the s_r_ system would be uh something like three francs per item user interface : yeah . three euros . industrial designer : three euros sorry . and um marketing : that 's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ? industrial designer : no no no , part of that , yeah . user interface : part of that . marketing : so that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . project manager : mm 'kay . hmm . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : well i think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : it 's too user interface : it it should not be cluttering up everything . marketing : what 's this one on the side ? user interface : ah that 's for the it 's kind of a l_e_d_ for indicating your battery industrial designer : locati . location . marketing : ah okay . user interface : and as well as it 's like a blinking one marketing : mm-hmm . mm 'kay . user interface : you know industrial designer : yeah . user interface : you can keep it aside ."
