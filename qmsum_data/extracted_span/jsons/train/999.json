    "answer": "project manager : and also what you said . um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : but i think it 's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . user interface : yeah . project manager : so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . user interface : okay . project manager : and then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . user interface : yeah . uh . project manager : that 's safe . marketing : i 'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? project manager : yeah . that 's a good point . industrial designer : mm i do n't have any information on pricing . so i 'll have to ask the manufacturing department . marketing : 'cause in our earlier um market research , if you 'd allow me to go to the flat board , smartboard . project manager : yeah , sure . go ahead . marketing : um so it was open here . um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . well you can see here , our target group would not do that . so if that would increase the price for which we 're selling our remote control i would greatly advise not to do it . project manager : yeah . marketing : i think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the project manager : yeah . marketing : younger people . user interface : 'kay . industrial designer : but that would also go for the lcd screen then i guess . it 's a bit higher percentage , but marketing : um well this is yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . so that does n't really mean they would n't pay extra for it . and on top of that the lcd screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : and i think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . project manager : easier to use ? no , i think that 's a good point . user interface : but uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh lcd sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ? marketing : um well this was for like an lcd screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones . user interface : okay . marketing : so pretty large . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : i personally think the lcd screen we wan na use , with the extra information , i think nobody has anything against it . because it 's just uh some extra information , and it 's easy to ignore as well . so if you do n't wan na use it you just do n't use it . user interface : yeah . project manager : and um yeah i think the um maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . and i do n't think the i do n't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . user interface : yeah . project manager : so that brings us back to the energy . if we do n't have the voice recognition , it will it wo n't use a lot of energy to use . um user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . and much cheaper as well . user interface : yeah . project manager : so"
