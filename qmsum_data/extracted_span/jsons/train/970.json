    "answer": "grad f : oops . phd i : um , so , uh , we had a discussion don and liz and i had discussion last week about how to proceed with , uh , you know , with don 's work , and and and , uh , one of the obvious things that occur to us was that we 're since we now have thilo 's segmenter and it works , you know , amazingly well , um , we should actually basically re - evaluate the recognition , um , results using you know , without cheating on the segmentations . phd e : so phd i : and , that should be fairly phd e : and how do we find the transcripts for those so that ? yeah . the references for for those segments ? phd i : oh , ok . so , there 's actually phd e : it 's not that phd i : why do you ask ? grad f : i could phd i : no , actually , um , nist has , um m a fairly sophisticated scoring program that you can give a , um a time , grad f : hand ones . phd g : well phd i : uh you know , you basically just give two time - marked sequences of words , and it computes the um the , { comment } uh { comment } you know , the the th phd b : it does all the work for you . phd i : it does all the work for you . phd b : yeah . phd i : so , it we just and we use that actually in hub - five to do the scoring . um . so what we 've been using so far was sort of a simplified version of the scoring . and we can we can handle the the the type of problem we have here . phd e : so , basically you give some time constraints for for the references and for for the hypothesis , phd i : so , we ha yeah . right . phd e : and yeah , ok . phd g : yeah . phd i : right . phd g : maybe the start of your speech and the end of it , or stuff like that . phd i : right . it does time - constrained word - alignment . so . so that should be possible . i mean that should n't be a problem . uh , so that was the one thing , and the other was that , um what was the other problem ? oh ! that thilo wanted to use the recognizer alignments to train up his , um , speech detector . phd e : yeah . phd i : um , so that we could use , uh you know there would n't be so much hand labelling needed to , uh to generate training data for for the speech detector . phd e : yeah . i 'm just in progress of of doing that . so . phd i : and i think you 're in the process of doing that . phd e : yeah . phd i : so , you can { comment } you can phd b : it 'll give you a lot more data , too . wo n't it ? phd e : yeah . so , it 's basically s i think , eight meetings or something which which i 'm using , and , it 's before it was twenty minutes of one meeting . phd i : mm - hmm . phd e : so should { comment } be a little bit better . phd i : right . phd b : great . phd i : that wo n't be perfect the alignments are n't perfect , phd e : yeah . but phd i : but , um , it 's probably still better to have all this extra data , than phd g : yeah . phd e : yeah . yep . phd i : yeah . phd e : we 'll see that . phd i : yeah . phd g : actually , i had a question about that . if you find that you can lower the false alarms that you get where there 's no speech , that would be useful for us to know . so , um phd e : there were the false alarms . phd g : yeah . so , r right now you get f fal you know , false false , uh , speech regions when it 's just like , um , breath or something like that , phd e : ok . yeah . yep . phd g : and i 'd be interested to know the wha if you retrain um , phd e : yeah . phd g : do those actually go down or not ? because of phd e : yeah . i 'll can make an can , like , make a c comparison of of the old system to the to the new one , and then phd g : yeah , just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of just having that training data wh what happens . phd e : yeah . yeah . yep . professor d : um another one that we had on adam 's agenda that definitely involved you was s something about smartkom ? grad f : right . so , rob porzel eh , porzel ? and the , uh porzel and the , uh , smartkom group are collecting some dialogues . phd i : porzel . porzel . grad f : basically they have one person sitting in here , looking at a picture , and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere . and , uh , they 're doing a travel task . and , uh , it involves starting i believe starting with a it 's it 's always the wizard , but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a , uh , speech generation system . phd e : yeah . actually , it 's changed to a synthesis for for the first part now . grad f : synthesis system . phd e : yeah . grad f : um , and then , it goes to a real wizard and they 're evaluating that . and they wanted to use this equipment , and so the w question came up , is well , here 's some more data . should this be part of the corpus or not ? and my attitude was yes , because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustics , as opposed to just for language . um , or also for dialogue of various sorts . um , so it 's not a meeting . right ? because it 's two people and they 're not face to face . professor d : wait a minute . so , i just wanted to understand it , cuz i i 'm uh , had n't quite followed this process . phd e : yeah . professor d : um . so , it 's wizard in the sen usual sense that the person who is asking the questions does n't know that it 's , uh , a machi not a machine ? phd i : right . grad f : at the beginning . phd i : actually actually , w w the the we do this i dunno who came up with it , but i think it 's a really clever idea . we simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session , and so then after that , the person 's told that they 're now talking to a , uh to a human . professor d : yeah . phd e : it 's a human operator . professor d : yeah . phd e : yeah . grad f : but of course they do n't know that it 's the same person both times . phd i : so , we we collect we collect both human - computer and human - human data , essentially , in the same session . professor d : you might wan na try collecting it the other way around sometime , saying that th the computer is n't up yet and then so then you can separate it out whether it 's the beginning or end kind of effects . phd i : that 's an idea . professor d : but , yeah . phd i : yeah . postdoc a : that 's a good idea . grad f : `` i have to go now . you can talk to the computer . `` phd b : it 's a lot more believable , too , grad f : `` no ! `` phd b : if you tell them that they 're the computer part is running on a windows machine . and the whole breakdown thing kinda makes sense . phd i : o just just reboot it . grad f : abort abort , retry , fail ? phd g : so did they actually save the far - field data ? grad f : well , this was this was the question . phd g : cuz at first they were n't they were n't sa phd i : yeah . grad f : so so they were saying they were not going to , phd e : yeah . grad f : and i said , `` well that 's silly , if if we 're gon na try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . `` phd g : yeah . or phd e : projector { comment } we were not saying we are not doing it . phd g : yeah . phd e : we wer we just wanted to do phd i : no , the the question is do we save one or two far - field channels or all of them ? phd g : right . phd e : yeah . yeah . grad f : i i see no reason not to do all of them . professor d : um grad f : that that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies , uh , it 's nice to have the same for every recording . phd g : nnn . yeah . professor d : so , what is the purpose of this recording ? phd i : mm - hmm . professor d : this is to get acoustic and language model training data for smartkom . ok . phd i : it 's to be traini to b training data and development data for the smartkom system . phd e : the english system ? yeah . phd i : yeah . right . right . phd b : where does this ? phd g : maybe we can have him vary the microphones , too , professor d : well , phd g : or they 're different s speakers . grad f : right . so so so for their usage , they do n't need anything . professor d : so why not ? phd e : yeah . grad f : right ? phd e : but but i 'm not sure about the legal aspect of of that . is is there some contract with smartkom or something about the data ? phd i : yeah . phd e : what they or , is is that our data which we are collecting here , professor d : we 've never signed anything that said that we could n't use anything that we did . phd e : or ? ok . ok . phd i : we were n't supposed to collect any data . phd e : so . ok . professor d : yeah . phd e : so . yeah , th th that was the question . phd i : this was all phd e : if if ? yeah . phd i : yeah . professor d : no that 's not a problem . phd e : basically . professor d : i l look , it seems to me that if we 're doing it anyway and we 're doing it for these these purposes that we have , and we have these distant mikes , we definitely should re should save it all as long as we 've got disk space , phd i : mm - hmm . professor d : and disk is pretty cheap . so should we save it ? grad f : and then professor d : now th yeah . so we save it because it 's it it 's potentially useful . and now , what do we do with it is is a s separate question . grad f : right . professor d : i mean , anybody who 's training something up could choose to put it eh , to u include this or not . phd i : right . professor d : i i would not say it was part of the meetings corpus . it is n't . but it 's some other data we have , and if somebody doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can . right ? phd i : mm - hmm . grad f : so it 's it it i guess it the begs the question of what is the meeting corpus . so if , at uw they start recording two - person hallway conversations is that part of the meeting corpus ? professor d : i think it 's i i think i th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key . grad f : well , this has two or more people conversing with each other . professor d : nnn , well phd e : yeah . postdoc a : well this grad f : they 're just not face to face . phd g : what if we just give it a a name like we give these meetings a name ? professor d : no , it does n't . right ? it has grad f : i mean , that was my intention . phd g : and then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people wo n't , postdoc a : well this professor d : yeah . grad f : that was my intention . so so s so part of the reason that i wanted to bring this up is , do we wan na handle it as a special case or do we wan na fold it in , phd g : and just give it a title . professor d : i think it is a s grad f : we give everyone who 's involved as their own user id , give it session i ds , let all the tools that handle meeting recorder handle it , or do we wan na special case it ? and if we were gon na special case it , who 's gon na do that ? phd i : well , it it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure , since we do n't want to duplicate things unnecessarily . phd e : it it it postdoc a : i think phd i : but as far as distributing it , we should n't label it as part of this meeting corpus . professor d : yeah . phd i : we should let it be its own corp postdoc a : well it 's it well , because grad f : i do n't see why not . it 's just a different topic . postdoc a : i ha i have an extra point , which is the naturalness issue . because we have , like , meetings that have a reason . that 's one of the reasons that we were talking about this . and and those and this sounds like it 's more of an experimental setup . professor d : yeah . postdoc a : it 's got a different purpose . professor d : it 's scenario - based , it 's it 's human - computer interface it 's really pretty different . postdoc a : yeah . professor d : but i i i have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they 're gon na do , but i do n't think i it it does n't match anything that we 've described about meetings . grad f : mm - hmm . professor d : whereas everything that we talked about them doing at at uw and so forth really does . they 're actually talking grad f : ok . so w so what does that mean for how we are gon na organize things ? phd e : yeah . professor d : you can you can again , as as i think andreas was saying , if you wan na use the same tools and the same conventions , there 's no problem with that . it 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's you know . it is different . you ca n't just fold it in as if it 's i mean , digits are different , too . right ? grad f : yeah , but those are folded in , phd i : it might also be potentially confusing . grad f : and it 's just you just mark the transcripts differently . so so one option is you fold it in , phd i : right . grad f : and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction . phd i : yeah , i th professor d : well , i don i would n't call reading digits `` meetings `` . right ? i mean , we we we were doing grad f : well , but but , i put it under the same directory tree . professor d : well grad f : you know , it 's in `` user doctor speech data mr `` . phd g : can we just have a directory called , like , `` other stuff `` ? grad f : other . phd g : and well or , i dunno . professor d : i mean , i do n't care what directory tree you have it under . phd g : and and just , um , store it there . professor d : right ? i mean that 's just a grad f : ok . my preference is to have a single procedure so that i do n't have to think too much about things . phd g : i mean professor d : yeah . grad f : and , just have a marking . professor d : o - you you can use whatever procedure you want that 's p convenient for you . grad f : if we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure , and someone has to do that . professor d : all i 'm saying is that there 's no way that we 're gon na tell people that reading digits is meetings . and similarly we 're not gon na tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings . grad f : right . professor d : those are n't meetings . but if it makes it easier for you to pu fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree , knock yourself out . phd b : there 's a couple other questions that i have too , professor d : you know ? phd b : and and one of them is , what about , uh , consent issues ? and the other one is , what about transcription ? are ? phd e : transcription is done in munich . phd b : ok . so we do n't have to worry about transcribing it ? professor d : alright . phd e : yeah . grad f : so , w we will hafta worry about format . phd i : that 's a that 's another argument to keep it separate , because it 's gon na follow the smartkom transcription conventions and not the icsi meeting transcription conventions . phd e : yeah . grad f : oh , ok . professor d : ah . good point . grad f : ok . well , i did n't realize that . that 's that 's a professor d : good point . but i 'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or or some things . um . do we h do we have , uh , um , american - born folk , uh , reading german german , uh , pla uh , place names and so forth ? is that ? phd e : yeah . phd i : exactly . professor d : yeah , great ."
