    "answer": "phd c : about other experiments ? uh , now , i 'm interested in , um , uh looking at the experiments where you use , um uh , data from multiple languages to train the neural net . and i do n't know how far , or if you guys even had a chance to try that , but that would be some it 'd be interesting to me . phd a : yeah , but again , it 's the kind of of thing that , uh , we were thin thinking thinking that it would work , but it did n't work . and , eh , so there is kind of of not a bug , but something wrong in what we are doing , perhaps . professor d : yeah . phd c : right . right . phd a : uh , something wrong , perhaps in the just in the the fact that the labels are phd c : right . mm - hmm . phd a : what worked best is the hand - labeled data . phd c : mm - hmm . phd a : um uh , so , yeah . i do n't know if we can get some hand - labeled data from other languages . phd c : yeah . phd a : it 's not so easy to find . phd c : right . phd a : but that would be something interesting t to to see . phd c : yeah , yeah . professor d : yeah . also , uh , i mean , there was just the whole notion of having multiple nets that were trained on different data . so one form of different data was is from different languages , but the other well , i in fact , uh , m in those experiments it was n't so much combining multiple nets , it was a single net that had different phd a : yeah . professor d : so , first thing is would it be better if they were multiple nets , for some reason ? second thing is , never mind the different languages , just having acoustic conditions rather than training them all up in one , would it be helpful to have different ones ? so , um that was a question that was kind of raised by mike shire 's thesis , and on in that case in terms of reverberation . right ? that that sometimes it might be better to do that . but , um , i do n't think we know for sure . so , um right . so , next week , we , uh , wo n't meet because you 'll be in europe . whe - when are you two getting back ?"
