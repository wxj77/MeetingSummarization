    "query": "<s> what did julie morgan recommend to do when discussing the demand-driven approach in the programme and why ?",
    "answer": "sian gwenllian am : just in terms of the foundation phase , there have been cuts , of course , in expenditure in that phase . how concerned are you about that and the impact that that will have on the way in which the foundation phase is taught in our schools ? the foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant , which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent , and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding . so , are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase ? julie morgan am : i have n't seen any evidence . obviously , i must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the minister for education , but i have n't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered , and the reports from estyn are very good . in fact , i think the foundation phase is one of our great joys , that we absolutely celebrate it , and so i 'd be very concerned if i thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase , and i certainly have n't had any evidence of that . i would want to guard against that . sian gwenllian am : exactly , but if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system because of the cuts , it 's going to impact on standards , at the end of the day . julie morgan am : i think we have to be very careful to see that lower standards are not implemented , because it was groundbreaking when we brought it in , and it has proved to be a great success , so we want to make sure that 's guarded . lynne neagle am : thank you . janet . janet finch-saunders am : going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of wales , the welsh and uk governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market , with subsidies mainly given to working parents . is that a mistake ? should it be more universally available ? julie morgan am : well , some of our provision is universally available in certain areas . for example , the flying start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas , and i think that 's very important , because that does mean that there is n't stigma , and so , in those areas , everybody can take advantage of it , and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it 's reaching those areas . so , i think that there is a purpose behind that . in terms of when you say demand led , could you elaborate on that ? janet finch-saunders am : i know that\u2014we 've just had a useful briefing from david dallimore , and , basically , there is this theory that there are too many resources\u2014the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors : geographic spread in terms of it being more universal , and whether that 's the right way . how do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds , in their own peer or age group ? julie morgan am : it is demand\u2014 nicola edwards : [ inaudible . ] \u2014because the offer is targeted at working parents\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : yes , yes . nicola edwards : \u2014obviously , then the amount of availability is based on how many parents apply for it and take it up . is that the context of demand led in that\u2014 right , okay . julie morgan am : it is universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working , and i think what you 're saying is that it should be available to everybody . lynne neagle am : i think the point that janet 's making is that some areas have traditionally got more childcare anyway because they have traditionally had more demand in those areas , so there 's not a level playing field to start from . is that correct ? julie morgan am : i think that , historically , that is definitely true , and when you look at the take-up of the childcare offer , it 's certainly taken up in some areas with a very high take-up rate . i think ynys m\u00f4n was nearly 90 per cent or something\u2014 sian gwenllian am : they need more money , because they have n't got enough funding . dawn bowden am : so does everywhere . sian gwenllian am : no , to meet the demand . julie morgan am : in other areas , it 's much , much lower\u2014in some of the cities , i know . so , there is a big range in take-up\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : so , do you intend to bring something forward to address that ? julie morgan am : we are planning to extend it . we 're looking at the possibility of extending it to parents who are in education and training . so , we are widening the offer , yes . obviously , we have to wait for the evaluation of that . it would be great to be able to offer it to absolutely everybody , but obviously we have got the finance to look at in terms of how we do that . but we are certainly planning to expand it . lynne neagle am : we 've got questions on the offer in a little while . janet . janet finch-saunders am : does the welsh government intend to develop an integrated approach , then , against all settings ? if so , given the current inconsistencies , how can quality be assured ?"
