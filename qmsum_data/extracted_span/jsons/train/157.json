hon . bernadette jordan ( south shorest . margarets , lib . ) : mr . chair , i want to thank my colleague for the very good question . the ontario inland fishers and the people in ontario are eligible for other programs that are offered through the regional development agencies . we are going to make sure that no industry is left behind when it comes to our fisheries . we 're making sure that we 're addressing the concerns of inland fisheries as well as coastal fisheries . those programs will be available to anyone who needs to apply through the rdas . mr. dave epp : minister , will you then direct these regional agencies to provide equitable funding equivalent to the seafood stabilization fund ? hon . bernadette jordan : mr . chair , we 're making sure that they have the same access to programs through the regional development agencies as there is through the seafood stabilization fund . we 're making sure that everyone who is in need of support through the programs will be able to access it . mr. dave epp : according to stats canada , before my granddaughter turns one year old , her share of the federal debt will be over $ 39,000 . what is minister morneau 's fiscal plan for canada so that the interest on this debt does n't cripple canada with higher taxes ? hon . bill morneau : mr . chair , we realize that it 's always important to be responsible from a fiscal standpoint . we believe that the responsible approach today is to make investments to support canadians and to support businesses . in that way we can have jobs and we can get through this pandemic and have a strong economy and be able to continue with our approach to managing our economy in a responsible the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll go back to mr. epp . mr. dave epp : minister , when can parliament , or this semblance of it , see that plan for economic prosperity ? the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : i would like to remind honourable members to direct their questions through the chair . the honourable minister may reply . hon . bill morneau : thank you , mr . chair . we 've been quite clear that we need to be transparent on a daily basis by giving canadians an understanding of the investments that we 're making through this pandemic . once the situation is more stable economically , we will certainly be coming forward with a broader plan . mr. dave epp : mr . chair , the canadian chamber of commerce said three months before the pandemic that this current government 's level of spending and incurring of debt is untenable and that future generations , like my granddaughter , will have to pay for it . how much more debt is the minister planning to incur ? hon . bill morneau : mr . chair , coming into this pandemic in a strong fiscal position with the lowest amount of debt among the g7 countries is a function of our economy that 's afforded us the opportunity to invest on behalf of canadians . we will continue to take that approach . we believe that 's the responsible thing to do through the course of this challenge . mr. dave epp : what is the budget for stopping illegal american guns from getting through our borders ? hon . marc garneau ( minister of transport ) : mr . chair , i thank the member for the question . i can tell you that we have invested considerable amounts of money and have earmarked ongoing monies to ensure that we address the issue of illegal guns passing across the border . we realize the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll go back to mr. epp . mr. dave epp : what 's the budget , then , to fight government-trained and licensed canadians in the court challenge that 's now been triggered ? the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we will go to the honourable minister . we 're not getting any audio . mr. dave epp : i have a point of order , mr . chair . could i have some more time , please ? the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : yes . we 're just going to hold time here momentarily , mr. epp . hon . marc garneau : i apologize , mr . chair . could i ask for the question to be repeated , please ? the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : mr. epp , what is your question again ? mr. dave epp : what is the budget for fighting the government-trained and licensed people who are now triggering a lawsuit against your order in council ? hon . marc garneau : mr . chair , i do n't have the answer to that question , but obviously the government will defend its position . mr. dave epp : mr . chair , covid-19 has exacerbated the problem of this government 's policy of spending the cupboards bare in good times instead of planning for a rainy dayand folks , we 're in a storm . unlike this government , municipalities can not by law say put it on the tab for the next generation . the balanced budget requirements force them to choose between slashed services and drastic tax hikes . the federation of canadian municipalities says they need $ 10 billion in targeted emergency operating funding , so do municipalities slash services , do they raise taxes , or will we be there for the municipalities ? hon . chrystia freeland : our government absolutely understands the crucial role municipalities play as the engine of our economy at all times , and particularly today , as in many parts of the country we are looking to restart the economy . that is why the prime minister announced just this morning that we will be accelerating payments under the gas tax fund . municipalities will receive the full amount of their 2020-21 payment on june 10 . this will help them with some of their near-term liquidity issues ."
