    "query": "<s> how did the deputy minister speak to her amendments in group 1 that related to the duty to promote public awareness ?",
    "answer": "julie morgan am : thank you very much , chair . my amendments 1 and 4 will place a duty on welsh ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the act commences . i tabled these amendments in response to this committee 's recommendation\u2014this was a recommendation from this committee in the stage 1 report , so i have responded to that . i 've already made a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over approximately six years from royal assent , should the bill be passed . i 've considered amendments 1a to 1e , which have been tabled by janet finch-saunders , and which relate to the duty to raise awareness . amendment 1a introduces a reference to public understanding . we do n't think , actually , that this adds anything to the government amendment , which already mentions awareness . it makes the awareness-raising duty open-ended with no time limit , which is not necessary . by commencement , messaging around the change in the law will be embedded . the awareness-raising campaign will continue for a number of years . therefore , an ongoing duty referring specifically to the law change would not be required . i understand , of course , that the awareness-raising campaign needs to be comprehensive , well planned and to reach out to all those people and all those communities who need to be aware of the law change , and understand how to respond to it . but i do n't think it 's helpful or necessary to highlight specific groups , such as visitors to wales , on the face of the bill\u2014that 's the approach taken in amendment 1e\u2014as it risks placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others . in relation to children , the committee will know that i 'm fully committed to children \u2019 s rights , and that welsh ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions . an additional due regard requirement , such as the one set out in amendment 1d , relating specifically to the need to promote awareness among children is not needed . this would be part and parcel of the welsh government approach to putting children \u2019 s rights at the heart of our policy making . similarly , i do n't think it 's necessary for the bill to set out specifically the topics that need to be covered in the awareness-raising campaign , as is suggested in amendments 1b and 1c . that level of detail , i do n't think , is for the face of the bill . information required about parenting support will be considered by the parenting expert group , under the auspices of the bill \u2019 s strategic implementation group , working with my officials and the expert stakeholder group on the awareness-raising campaign . and , really , their thinking should not be constrained in any way by specifications on the face of the bill . i think we always need to bear in mind that what the bill does is remove a defence to an existing criminal offence ; it does not create a new offence . and in this context , it does n't make sense for this bill to contain a provision requiring the provision of information about how a person may raise concerns if it appears to them that a child is being physically punished . as i set out in my letter to this committee responding to recommendation 15 on this point , safeguarding is everyone \u2019 s business , and , as now , the public have a role in highlighting to relevant services if they are concerned about a child . i 'm asking for the support of members for amendments 1 and 4 , and i ask members to reject amendments 1a to 1e because this would place unnecessary provisions on the face of the bill . thank you all very much for your contributions to the debate and your comments on these amendments today . i just want to re-emphasise that it is as a result of the recommendation from this committee that we are putting this duty to have the awareness campaign on the face of the bill , and i absolutely recognise the crucial role awareness raising has to play in supporting the implementation of the bill . i 'm very grateful for and appreciate the committee 's interest and the work that you 've done in this area of work . but i do think that these amendments are unnecessary . if we go through them , amendment 1a is really open-ended on promoting public awareness . we 're committed to a high-intensity awareness over six years from royal assent , and there is an expert stakeholder group supporting us with the development of the awareness campaign . all the points that you 've been making will be being considered by that group . i think the level of detail on the face of the bill is not needed . suzy davies am : okay . would you just take an intervention on that just to help me understand ? a two-year awareness-raising campaign\u2014how have you concluded that\u2014 julie morgan am : six-year . suzy davies am : i thought it was two years before section 1 comes into force . julie morgan am : we 've got six years from royal assent . suzy davies am : oh , so it is going to continue beyond section 1 coming into force\u2014 julie morgan am : yes . oh yes , it 's going to continue . suzy davies am : that 's very helpful ."
