    "query": "<s> what did julie morgan respond to the worry of heavy workload for social workers when talking about relative agencies and workload ?",
    "answer": "dawn bowden am : okay , that 's fine . thank you very much . the other response that we 've received is from social workers . and they 've talked about the fact that the social worker 's workload is already very stretched , and you 'll be aware of that , minister . and i think they were getting a little bit concerned about whether a whole raft of new cases are going to land on what is an already extremely heavy workload , and how effectively they could deal with that . would you say that those concerns , in terms of the impact of this bill , are unfounded , or are we just saying that this is an unknown quantity at this stage , and we 're going to have to wait and see ? julie morgan am : well , first of all , if i can just pay tribute to the work that social workers do . dawn bowden am : yes , absolutely . julie morgan am : because , obviously , they \u2019 re going to be essential to the successful implementation of this bill . i was a social worker myself , so i \u2019 m very happy to pay tribute to them . [ laughter . ] but they do do a hard job , which isn \u2019 t always recognised , i think , by the public . so , i do take this point very seriously , but , obviously , the professionals who have given evidence\u2014many of them have said they don \u2019 t see there being a big rise of referrals . jane randall , national independent safeguarding board\u2014i think she came to you\u2014said : 'there 's no expectation that there 's going to be a huge increase in the number of referrals\u2026i think it would be dealt with within their existing resources . ' i mean , there may be an increase in reporting of incidents , initially , maybe from individuals in the community and organisations such as schools . and i think it could have an impact on the initial stages of social services activity , which i think others\u2014i think sally jenkins said that maybe there \u2019 d be an increase , a small increase , at the beginning . but as we expect the awareness raising and the ongoing support that we \u2019 ll be giving to parents\u2014we do feel that the incidents of physical punishment will be falling over time . and we don \u2019 t really see that there will be an increase . but i know that social workers are stretched , and are hard-pressed\u2014and i think that was some of the evidence given to you by the british association of social workers . but i think it \u2019 s important to remember that they are also very strongly in support of us carrying out this legislation . but it is important to look at the realities and the practicalities . so , we \u2019 re going to work very closely with social services\u2014obviously , key members of our implementation group\u2014and we will collect relevant data for a period before the actual implementation , in order to get a baseline . we want a baseline , and we are working with a small number of social services to try to get the baseline of where it is , and to see what happens when the bill is implemented . the evidence from other countries is that they certainly have not been overwhelmed . there have been reports in new zealand that they have not been overwhelmed , and i mentioned ireland earlier . so , i don \u2019 t think , really , we have to fear that social services would be overwhelmed , but we must be prepared , and we must get this data and monitor it closely . dawn bowden am : keep it monitored . and i guess things will level out in due course . and social services clearly having to make judgments every day\u2014they will be making those judgments quite quickly and turning them around ."
