    "query": "<s> what were the measures concerning the normal holiday provision for children ?",
    "answer": "suzy davies am : okay . the second part of my question is : there were going to be easter holidays anyway , were n't there ? what was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period ? has that gone out of the window now , the normal holiday provision for children ? because that 's not there normally , is it , except in separate\u2014 kirsty williams am : we do find ourselves in a strange situation . my understanding is what we 're trying to work to is that we would have ongoing provision and not to make some strange , 'you get this for two weeks , then you do n't get it for two weeks , and then you 're back in . ' my understanding is , in england , that is what they 're going to do . we 're trying to create a system where it will be seamless and it will not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays . it wo n't matter to those nurses and doctors who will need to be in work during those weeks . we 're trying to create a system that will run uniformly . that 's our policy goal at the moment . lynne neagle am : helen mary . helen mary jones am : just briefly , building on suzy 's question , one particular group of children and young people that i hope will be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category is young carers . for some of them , they may not be able to come into school because the people they 're caring for may have to be excluded because of their conditions . but i think that , for other young carers , coming to school is an absolute lifeline , because they 're working at home . so , i do n't know if it 's appropriate for you to specifically mention those in discussions with local authorities , but it 's a group of young people who , again , may not be vulnerable in other ways , but because of their caring responsibilities they may need school . and the other group\u2014and this , i suppose , goes back to suzy 's point about teachers knowing their young people\u2014is the children who may be living in situations where they 're at risk of witnessing domestic abuse . again , these may very well not be children who are in any formal contact with social services , but being at home may be really not a good place for them to be . so , again , i 'd put in an appeal for that to be something that perhaps can be raised with schools . if a teacher is worried about what a child 's circumstances are like at home , whether they can be , as you said , kirsty , included as one of the\u2014 . they may not be formally identified , but if the teacher knows that they 're at risk , or there is an instinct that they 're at risk , they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you 're making at this difficult time . kirsty williams am : we will certainly raise those issues . we have to do that in the context of what is deliverable , and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well . one of the reasons why schools are closing is to help manage this disease . we know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still . so , we will take these issues into consideration , but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan . rob is the expert on that , not me . rob orford : yes , absolutely . this is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we have n't seen in 100 years , and so we 're having to evolve and iterate things as we go . next week , i think , will look different to this week . so , it kind of is what it is . we 've all got a role to play , and schools certainly have a significant role to play in breaking those chains of transmission . areas that we 're worried about are displacement activities . if we close the schools , then people collect at others ' houses . we need to send a really clear message that you 're all part of the solution , and the things that you do by distancing yourselves from your friends and your family are really important for us to get on top of this outbreak . the more that we can do that , the easier it will be when we go forward . helen mary jones am : i 'm sure that that 's true , but i 'm sure that we would n't be wanting a child who 's in a very pressured environment with perhaps a very difficult relationship between mum and dad\u2014 . it may be very important for those children to be out of that for some of the time . hopefully , we 're talking about relatively small numbers , but i just\u2014 . kirsty williams am : we will look at vulnerability in a holistic way . lynne neagle am : janet , you had a supplementary . janet finch-saunders am : thank you , chair , and good morning , minister , and your team . can i just put on record my thanks for all that you 're having to endure at this moment ? i think it 's fair to say you have the support of assembly members and , indeed , our communities . now , the question i have : if cylch meithrin have to close , where will they get money from to pay their staff ? because , currently , thankfully , there 's support for businesses . lynne neagle am : janet , we 're not doing cylch meithrin at the moment ; we are sticking with schools , as we discussed in advance . dawn . dawn bowden am : can i just get some clarity , steve , around what you were saying in terms of next week ? because i think the practical applications of this\u2014and i understand that you do n't know all of this yet , i understand that\u2014the practical applications are what is coming to us , obviously , with constituents saying , 'well , what 's going to happen to that ? ' just so that i can be clear , are you saying that , at this stage , every headteacher will be in school on monday , as will all their staff ?"
