    "query": "<s> why did jassa scott believe it was more difficult for secondary schools to prioritize mental health and well-being ?",
    "answer": "jassa scott : yes , you 're right . as we mentioned earlier , we do pupil surveys before all our inspections , and across a number of those indicators , like , 'how well does the school listen ? do adults in school care about me ? how well does the school deal with bullying ? '\u2014quite a lot those ones around well-being do tail off . nine out of 10 pupils at key stage 2 have that confidence , down to half at key stage 4 , as you say . and i think there are a number of factors that we think contribute to that : i think one of the factors is that pupils face , sometimes , more challenges as they get older in those teenage years , but they also become more reflective and perhaps more discerning . and i think what we find in secondary schools is perhaps secondary school pupils notice sometimes the differences between their everyday life that they experience in school and perhaps the messages that they 're getting about well-being in terms of their lessons , in terms of assemblies and in terms of school policies and so on . so , they are probably more discerning in noticing those differences and maybe there are some of those differences also there in primary school , but the pupils do n't notice . i think we 've already touched upon things like the differences in the way that , at primary school , you would tend to have a go-to adult , which is your teacher . the best secondary schools find ways to make sure that pupils do feel that level of support and feel there are trusted people , but it 's more of a challenge to make sure that that happens , because of the way they 're operating . we still have some concerns about personal and social education and the health and well-being support , which we 've made a recommendation about in the past in some of our thematic reports , but also recently in some of our secondary school inspection reports . and i think i already touched upon the fact that sometimes , when the budget is tight , it can be some of those\u2014they 're not peripheral in their importance , but they 're not the teacher in the classroom : well-being support assistants and so on and family liaison workers\u2014staff in the school who perhaps really support that pastoral care that the school as a whole can provide\u2014it may be that those are the roles that are less prevalent at times of less funding . so , i think there are some great members of staff doing a really good job , but perhaps they 're not those members of staff who can support teachers and support pupils in creating that kind of caring environment . maybe there a fewer of them around . so , i think there 's not an obvious answer and part of it is that they do become more discerning and perhaps more vocal in those responses generally , as they get older . so , you might have a truer reflection of opinions than perhaps\u2014 . and that might explain some of the difference with primary , where , generally , they 're quite positive about everything across most of the schools that we ask . lynne neagle am : so , it 's not that secondary schools\u2014because you 've said that in a previous inspection report\u2014are just not as good at prioritising mental health and well-being ."
