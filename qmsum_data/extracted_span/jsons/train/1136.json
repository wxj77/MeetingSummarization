    "query": "<s> what did the group think of using wood as manufacture material in the components design of the product ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it 's gets lost . um so the other w thing that we so . our method for going about this is we 've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what 's worked , what has n't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials marketing : industrial designer : and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing did n't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research . marketing : industrial designer : so um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . marketing : industrial designer : course , you know , i wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh does n't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore , user interface : industrial designer : so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that 's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor user interface : industrial designer : and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it 's uh goes with the board . uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it 's brittle it gets brittle after a while , user interface : industrial designer : so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium 's also been eliminated uh , user interface : industrial designer : the m people in manufacturing said that you could n't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how apple did it with th powerbook i 'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they 've eliminated all of our options except wood . user interface : at least it 's environmentally friendly . industrial designer : so , this is our finding . marketing : industrial designer : and a as she said , it 's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we 're we 're currently uh proposing , marketing : industrial designer : uh we 'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . marketing : industrial designer : so then there 's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , user interface : project manager : industrial designer : uh these simple chips , but that 's only works for the bu you do n't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . and um then there was the regular which i regret that i 've forgotten exactly why i 'm eliminating that one . uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , marketing : industrial designer : which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . marketing : industrial designer : and uh manufacturing has told us that they 've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um i i 'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , user interface : industrial designer : you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . i think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then i uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . so this is the findings of our research marketing : industrial designer : and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . do you have any problems with that ? project manager : can you go back uh one slide ? industrial designer : i 'm not sure , how do i oh , i know , let 's see . user interface : thank you . yeah . industrial designer : let 's go back up here . project manager : yes , uh question , uh , what 's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? what 's the meaning of that ? industrial designer : i think it 's um um a multiple uh chip design um and it 's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . user interface : project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : industrial designer : uh i could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . project manager : yeah , is it means it 's on the yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh industrial designer : i do n't know , but i 'll find out more at our next meeting . project manager : okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good . marketing : industrial designer : sounds good . user interface : why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? industrial designer : because um it gets brittle , cracks user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um we want we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . so . good ex good expression . user interface : whic which marketing : good expression . well after us . user interface : industrial designer : i do n't know , speak for yourself , i 'm planning to be around for a while . user interface : although i think marketing : user interface : i think with wood though you 'd run into the same types of problems , would n't you , i mean it chips , it if you drop it , industrial designer : marketing : user interface : uh it 's i 'm not su industrial designer : project manager : so so you 're not convinced about the the wood , yes . user interface : industrial designer : you 're what ? marketing : actually , i 'm ready to sell it . user interface : i think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , marketing : i 'm ready to sell it . industrial designer : you think ? and you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . user interface : but you ca n't just use marketing : no y no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , user interface : yeah , exactly , yeah . marketing : but there are some very pretty woods out there . industrial designer : well i 'm glad you user interface : marketing : that 's actually very innovative idea . industrial designer : okay , good . user interface : industrial designer : sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . marketing : industrial designer : marketing : well , it 's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : the stain . marketing : i mean it 's each person is gon na have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that 's not on the market . user interface : project manager : yeah , so it it 's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ? marketing : user interface : um , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own project manager : yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first marketing : in turns of wow . industrial designer : user interface : industrial designer : she works in the cubicle next to me so she 's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this . user interface : y yeah . marketing : industrial designer : luckily ed was not . user interface : marketing : wood ? user interface : i think we can get the quality materials then it should n't influence the design principles too much , which you 'll see with my presentation . marketing : user interface : one thing we 'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh industrial designer : mm-hmm . yeah , you would n't wan na have to have splinters in your hand while you 're using your user interface : yeah , for example . so , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , marketing : industrial designer : it 's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . user interface : but marketing : user interface : marketing : they do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , industrial designer : yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . marketing : so , and chew 'em up . and chew 'em up . industrial designer : and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um i think we 've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . project manager : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : a customisable and marketing : nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . user interface : what about the buttons , would would the buttons be wood too , or industrial designer : uh i do n't think so , no , project manager : i do n't think so . industrial designer : i think they could be rubber like they are now , project manager : yes . yes ."
