    "answer": "project manager : so we come again for the the second meeting . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one . user interface : project manager : and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . user interface : okay . project manager : and we have think i got a new project requirement . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so i think uh teletext becomes outdated . so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , industrial designer : okay . project manager : and i think we do n't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . and of course we should have our image in the in the design . so , let 's start with the the industrial designer . user interface : project manager : . user interface : industrial designer : yeah , alright . project manager : or y you can use the whiteboard if you want . industrial designer : so uh well i have a powerpoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder project manager : here . industrial designer : so i i i think you can reach it from here . marketing : just go to explorer . project manager : oh okay . marketing : or open . participant two . industrial designer : participant two . project manager : this one . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : open uh . industrial designer : uh open . project manager : do you want to open user interface : because it 's open you mean . project manager : industrial designer : right , so um i will talk about the the w working design and user interface : f_ five . marketing : slide show , view slide show , . industrial designer : and um well i i will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . user interface : industrial designer : so uh can you go one page down , please . so i think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . user interface : industrial designer : so uh mm i 'm thin uh i think uh i i 'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . then uh i will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like . user interface : industrial designer : and how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . user interface : industrial designer : and when we are ready with this first prototype i i think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . okay so can you go down uh so , wha what i think for now is we do n't want to have a remote control w which is wired user interface : project manager : industrial designer : so uh i think we u we can use a battery for the . then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . and the communication with the tv set is uh made through uh infrared communication so uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls user interface : did you draw it ? marketing : project manager : wow . industrial designer : so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the tv set . user interface : this . project manager : this user interface : what is the other chip for ? the one on top . industrial designer : the one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities user interface : marketing : one is a communication . industrial designer : and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the tv set . user interface : for men . to the in okay . industrial designer : and , that 's it . i think we should use a f_p_g_a_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t user interface : mm . what is f_p_g_a_ ? industrial designer : it 's field programmable uh something array . marketing : gateway arrays . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it 's a field programmable gateway arrays . user interface : so why 's it how is it different from the bluetooth ? industrial designer : well , uh a f_p_g_a_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . user interface : yeah . programme it . marketing : yeah . user interface : okay . industrial designer : and uh well the bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . user interface : yeah . uh so this are the they have to work together ? or ? do they have to work together or two separate choice industrial designer : no . well , th the f_p_g_a_ will produce the the data to send . user interface : okay . marketing : or it 's something like is n't hardware the first one ? and the second one is for the software . user interface : is the is the software par alri okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah to run th to make it run . user interface : okay , okay . marketing : that 's it . user interface : so you can control if you want , right ? industrial designer : yeah . alright and that 's it for the working design . user interface : industrial designer : so if you have any questions ? marketing : okay , and how about the battery power ? uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? industrial designer : uh no no no no , i think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the project manager : . marketing : into the industrial designer : yeah into the t . marketing : more compact and uh okay , industrial designer : yeah , yeah . user interface : industrial designer : and uh i i do n't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run , so user interface : mm . mm . marketing : yeah , yeah . okay . user interface : mm . you can put it on the charger when uh you when you do n't need to use it . industrial designer : yeah . it 's a good idea . marketing : yeah , that 's right . user interface : yeah . marketing : having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : people do n't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . user interface : yeah . mm . uh mm . marketing : we just make a small charger user interface : y yeah , yeah . marketing : and put it project manager : you can i yeah . user interface : because you are using because you are using bluetooth , if some people have p_d_a_ they can use their p_d_a_ to control the tv if they want to , right ? industrial designer : that 's a good idea . marketing : industrial designer : also , but but i i i think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control . project manager : user interface : i dunno . marketing : bu project manager : yeah we can change the b . marketing : our remote , project manager : yeah . marketing : we do not want to make it p_d_a_ . user interface : industrial designer : s okay , so charger for is the . user interface : so is mine . project manager : it 's mine . participant one , no ? user interface : oh . yeah , this your project manager : mm . oh we have so let 's move to to user interface design . user interface : yeah . so you can open uh project manager : participant user interface : three . yeah . so so i 'm working on the technical functions design . can you show the next slide . so the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . so so i found on a webs on the internet project manager : during the weekend . industrial designer : user interface : yeah . i spent a lot of time searching industrial designer : project manager : that 's good . user interface : and uh and i found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . industrial designer : project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : for example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . so i found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors industrial designer : user interface : so can you industrial designer : project manager : this are usual functionality . user interface : yeah , yeah , yeah . ours is a bit uh different . so these are two example . one is from the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . project manager : tasks . industrial designer : user interface : this is the most competing prototypes i 've found . industrial designer : user interface : but then uh loo but then i found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons industrial designer : project manager : and they are small . user interface : yeah . o on the right i tried to play with the problem is that uh if i have hundred channels i have uh i have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and i have to compose the number industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so it 's very lousy . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so you so you move to the next the next one . industrial designer : of course . user interface : yeah , so i talk about the problem . and then i i look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we do n't want that . project manager : yeah . user interface : so i propose the easy to use uh prototype . you can navigate on tv screen and we can the user 's preference and we need to have the tv connected to internet so we end in order to access the tv programmes by x_m_l_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . from the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the tv set than on the on the remote controller , right ? industrial designer : user interface : and then we the speech recognition as uh harry says we may just put in we may k_i_v_ . project manager : what do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the tv user interface : yeah , all the processing is done the tv is a compu has some processing power the project manager : than the industrial designer : so we have to t project manager : so we should have specific tv ? or ? we can use this . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we have to sell a tv with the remote control too . project manager : yeah , we do n't marketing : user interface : yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . project manager : yeah , i think so . j j just the remote control . marketing : yeah , not the tvs . industrial designer : i think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the tv set on recorders or thing like that user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because user interface : okay . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . okay . marketing : yeah , that 's right . user interface : so i the processing on on the remote controller project manager : yeah , user interface : so it can u be used in any tv , any conventional tv sets ? project manager : we . yeah . user interface : mm . okay . project manager : speech recognition . user interface : n yeah , that 's all . the next one ? so i come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons . industrial designer : yes , that 's a good idea , i think . project manager : keep the navigation industrial designer : we d we do n't we we do n't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the tv so uh project manager : but user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : well , f four five buttons , it 's sufficient . user interface : yeah . mm . industrial designer : it 's easy to build , user interface : industrial designer : it does not consume much power . marketing : yeah , that 's right . project manager : . user interface : okay , that 's all . marketing : oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . user interface : industrial designer : well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can user interface : mm . no , because you choose by channel , so you choose by tv program industrial designer : yeah . marketing : uh-huh huh huh huh . industrial designer : maybe you user interface : so you do n't have hundred channels to choose from . if you go by channel , you do n't have to do that . industrial designer : . marketing : mm-hmm hmm hmm . industrial designer : but uh i i think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could marketing : but project manager : so you are user interface : ah . ah , a big jump . marketing : yeah then yeah that 's right . user interface : a mouse or industrial designer : well , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or marketing : mm hmm hmm . okay . okay . user interface : mm . industrial designer : we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : how the this remote ? industrial designer : but we 'll see . user interface : uh it 's gon na be small . industrial designer : project manager : yeah , of course small . user interface : yeah . so it 'll beep if you wan na find it marketing : too small that it goes under the sofa and we ca n't find it . project manager : user interface : you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . marketing : yeah , industrial designer : marketing : that 's . user interface : i dunno how bu marketing : just give it a name and we call him . user interface : and responds to you , and industrial designer : marketing : yeah , that 's right . yeah , that 's right . industrial designer : okay , so uh next presentation user interface : project manager : participant four . so harry . marketing : okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , i think most of the points which i want to are already covered here . industrial designer : mm . user interface : marketing : and to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that these are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a tv remote but the technology we already know that as discussed earlier industrial designer : well i i think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts user interface : project manager : marketing : an it does how feasible it is . user interface : i- mm . but i think if you to recognise numbers it 's a well-studied problem . i if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary marketing : oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : we just have the industrial designer : and this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so it 's a good idea . marketing : it 's not going to take much space also . it 's going to be very slim . user interface : mm . mm . marketing : and next one was the size of the remote control . it has to be of course a very slim and small one . and of course most of the people are interested in if it 's less expensive , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so this is an important criteria here is user interface : but project manager : but do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . user interface : mm . marketing : i mean we have to look for a trade-off . user interface : yeah . marketing : the features and the cost . user interface : i no i i think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . industrial designer : project manager : yeah . marketing : user interface : maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , marketing : little bit more if it 's with extra features . project manager : it industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , extra features . industrial designer : yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature i think marketing : okay . user interface : mm . yeah . marketing : yeah , yeah . that 's right . project manager : but is it useful or not u i do n't know . industrial designer : well , uh project manager : there is in the marketing : i mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . industrial designer : marketing : or they say movie name or i do n't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . so , i think this should be a good idea , to put this features . and the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . industrial designer : we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so marketing : mm , i think user interface : industrial designer : i well project manager : i think i industrial designer : it will be alright . marketing : project manager : if it 's necessary can you can do that . user interface : what is the teletext ? mm . project manager : we can integrate small microphone in the remote industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so it 's not really a problem . industrial designer : okay . project manager : what about lighting adaptive options ? marketing : yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but i think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it 's not really required . project manager : according to the re to the new requirements i think we do n't need that . yeah . user interface : it is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller . so you need s special tv sets to do that ? or it 's it 's done via this remote controller ? it 's very complex . marketing : i mean industrial designer : yeah , i think it 's a bit complex too user interface : marketing : i mean yeah , it 's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it 's going to be working or not . industrial designer : for our next product , our new tv set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light marketing : i think project manager : user interface : yeah , then we can conclude that . yeah . yeah , but it 's quite possible but maybe not in this project . project manager : so we have i think we have s still we have couple of minutes . mm-mm . so any things to to discuss ? or any suggestions ? user interface : marketing : i think as i discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . user interface : marketing : the speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost . project manager : expensive . price . marketing : and the lighting adaptation and the teletext . and regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . user interface : okay . marketing : if you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes . user interface : yeah . okay . marketing : and uh if you are a french guy watching an english movie you would like to have it in french . industrial designer : . marketing : and if i am a german then i would like to have the my options in german . industrial designer : marketing : so , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . industrial designer : function . marketing : that should be a good uh point . industrial designer : yeah , but well what about the the new project 's requirement ? i i i think we should give up with teletext , no ? project manager : i think we we can we is the . industrial designer : yes . well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television . because if user interface : using the tv to access the internet ? or what ? i did n't quite understand industrial designer : yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be tv set that can access the internet . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , okay . industrial designer : so it 's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . marketing : we already have some . industrial designer : so if we already have it in our remote control project manager : so you have to anticipate the the future ? industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . the future demand , market demand . industrial designer : yeah , to desi marketing : yeah , that 's right . industrial designer : well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . project manager : . user interface : the functionality in the future . project manager : in future . user interface : alright . yeah . because all the tv sets will be digital , right . all the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : yeah , . industrial designer : okay . so project manager : okay . so let 's go for the the lunch break , and we will meet after . industrial designer : okay , thank you . user interface : okay . thank you ."
