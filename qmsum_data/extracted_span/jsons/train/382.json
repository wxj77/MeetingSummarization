    "answer": "user interface : no , i would n't say so . marketing : industrial designer : i mean , it 's quite easily accessible . project manager : yeah . marketing : i guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you 're s and then it goes , industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : that 's good yeah that a good idea . marketing : so if , if you 're like changing the volume during a movie . i know , i 'm thinking of mostly when you 're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and you do n't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there 's suddenly an explosion , and it 's gon na wake up the baby . user interface : yeah . marketing : um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it lights up for industrial designer : yeah . user interface : that , yeah , that 's a good idea . marketing : on self timer . industrial designer : so self-timed lighting . project manager : alright we have five minutes left marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um , i project manager : um , for the meeting , but i think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . um , what was i missed the last moment , reading that . what were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? marketing : oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell you know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it 's touched again . project manager : mm . so it could be any button that would be pressed . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . industrial designer : so , self-timed marketing : so if you have all the lights off in your living room , you 'll , you 'll temporarily see it . project manager : yeah . marketing : because usually you 're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay , so user interface : yeah . marketing : so project manager : that 's probably feasible . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? do we have to kind of decide what we 're gon na do with this . industrial designer : i think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah , okay . industrial designer : and i think that 's un unique as well . user interface : yeah . for visually impaired , yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i mean , i have n't seen that . and as you 're saying like numbers can wear off if they 're just sort of like painted on , you know printed . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah , yeah . and it could , if it 's that softer rubber material it 'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no industrial designer : durable . project manager : what 's it called , r_s_i_ , what was it that we were talking about ? industrial designer : oh yeah . yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : oh right , the project manager : yeah instead of like hard buttons . industrial designer : repetitive strain injury . project manager : okay . um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? user interface : if project manager : like should we do both ? or we can have one or the other ? because it might , for , for our design purposes , i mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with . marketing : i was gon na say , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : exactly . it the it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . project manager : yeah . marketing : it 's kind of like eighties neon-style . industrial designer : yeah , and we could marketing : um , whereas we 're trying to be trendy and fashionable . industrial designer : yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , marketing : so industrial designer : which could like link in with the company colours . like it could be blue or green or yellow , user interface : project manager : right . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : or like we 've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so project manager : right . alright . so we 've decided on lighting up things . user interface : i was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um real reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . industrial designer : yeah . every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : or , or the , whate project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : but with the same thing , i mean . if you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . marketing : that 's true . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . okay . project manager : is are you okay with that ? okay . cool . user interface : yeah . project manager : um alright . so i think that um that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions ."
