    "answer": "project manager : afternoon guys . it 's gon na be . marketing : rock and roll . project manager : oh . 'kay . marketing : so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? project manager : we may do . industrial designer : think s marketing : okay , can he get it all by himself this time ? project manager : i dunno , i 'm feeling like a big boy . industrial designer : mm . pro probably not , 'cause he 's 's been listening to too much . marketing : so industrial designer : he 's getting retarded . yay . marketing : i believe i can fly . user interface : alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys . industrial designer : or not . user interface : or not . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : just what i needed was something exciting . remember , i 'm an old man . industrial designer : project manager : 'kay , ready to go ? user interface : all ready . project manager : 'kay so we 've got our conceptual design meeting . industrial designer : apparently i 'm old as well . project manager : hopefully we 've all got exciting ideas now . marketing : thirty 's really young , eh ? user interface : we do . project manager : uh k exciting ideas . 'kay so here 's our agenda our agenda . um industrial designer : project manager : i 'm gon na open . i 'm gon na talk for a bit about what we 're gon na do . i 'm gon na take some notes . we 're gon na all do a presentation , and then hopefully we 're gon na make some decisions now . yep . well when i say hopefully , we have to . so user interface : alright . project manager : i 'm gon na let you guys talk before we make decisions . and does anyone really want to go first ? user interface : i guess i 'll go first . industrial designer : project manager : you p two ? user interface : yeah . project manager : what 's user interface : component , i think . yeah . project manager : components design . user interface : yep that 's it . industrial designer : presented by name . user interface : my name is . project manager : your name is name ? marketing : jose he man is . user interface : my name is name . project manager : huh hi name . industrial designer : my name is inigo montoya . project manager : industrial designer : you killed my father . user interface : sorry i did this in a bit of a rush . industrial designer : prepare to die . marketing : n name . project manager : right . user interface : so so here 's a look inside your really old-looking remote control . um you 've got a printed a printed uh circuit board here , and you 've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate marketing : project manager : we 've all broke a remote control ri um s yeah . user interface : yeah we 've all broken a remote control . industrial designer : marketing : i 've user interface : so you 've also got um you 've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . um marketing : i just love you tech guys , huh . industrial designer : yeah there 's a thingy and a dingy and project manager : you press this and it does th user interface : well marketing : yeah y do jabber user interface : so you 've got here 's here 's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , industrial designer : user interface : um you 've got the l_e_d_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board . um you 've got a couple diodes here for i do n't know who and whatnot . project manager : i dunno who and whatnot . user interface : so exactly . so um we 've got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here , this is a eighteen pin um uh chip i dunno . marketing : p yeah . user interface : uh it 's two double a_ batteries . industrial designer : user interface : this is pretty standard remote . so here are options for our power sources . you can use a basic battery , which we 've already discussed , um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : i wan na change that . user interface : i do n't know if that 's really marketing : i i got ta i got ta flashlight , and uh user interface : i do n't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so industrial designer : project manager : okay . user interface : you shake it . marketing : yeah but it 's interesting 'cause you shake it like this . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : like this . user interface : so that 's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy , marketing : and that 's on the camera . industrial designer : user interface : so it 's like that flashlight where you have to shake it . marketing : yeah . project manager : 'kay . user interface : uh we 've got solar cells , which i do n't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night which does n't make a lot of sense . project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : and finally we 've got our cradle o our power cradle idea . project manager : okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ? user interface : m battery versus cradle i think is yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : i like the kinetic . project manager : so we have battery versus cradle marketing : i g i i figured you would . yes . yeah . user interface : it could be fun . project manager : it 's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty , just to be actually serious for a minute here , user interface : yeah . project manager : you could user interface : well it is it is more uh i mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you 're still using power off the grid with the cradle . so um project manager : mm . hmm . user interface : our case design . we have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium . if we go with titanium we 're gon na be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it 's tough to shape the titanium , and uh yeah pers project manager : wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , would n't it . user interface : i think wood i marketing : it it it user interface : i i ca n't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it 's just anti-technology really , you know . project manager : okay . hmm . marketing : uh uh to me in a marketing sense it 's not it 's not relative . we can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it . user interface : right . project manager : okay . user interface : and what we may be able to do , and i think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these . um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i i think it feels a little better than the plastic . project manager : 'kay . do you get a good grip on the rubber ? yeah okay . user interface : yeah um marketing : and if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand . user interface : yeah . marketing : you do n't even need to lean down to get it . user interface : the advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we 'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape industrial designer : marketing : user interface : because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . so um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um project manager : okay . user interface : but basically these are curved and double-curved i i believe that the tech department , in their um in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . i have no idea exactly what they 're talking about , project manager : okay . user interface : but that 's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved . industrial designer : user interface : i would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it 's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? i think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes project manager : okay . user interface : or surfaces . i have no idea . project manager : i think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a marketing : mm-hmm yeah that 's yeah that 's what i see . project manager : yeah that 's what . user interface : oh okay oh like a wave , okay . marketing : yeah that 's what i see also . user interface : alright that makes sense okay . um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and lcd display , or multiple scrolling wheels . um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface . project manager : okay . user interface : for electronics , we have these very technical um descriptions here . a simple chip , which is the least expensive , but i have no numbers to give you , project manager : user interface : a regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh project manager : d do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ? user interface : yes the difference is , with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why does n't this scroll up ? previous previous , okay . a simple chip is required to operate push buttons . project manager : okay . user interface : um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the lcd display , and it did n't say specifically , but i i have a hunch that a regular chip is gon na be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels . project manager : okay . user interface : so but yeah . project manager : yeah that makes sense . so presentation from i guess design would go best . next . user interface : that 's the end of my presentation . project manager : technical functions or interface concept ? user interface : i think industrial designer : oh interface concept . project manager : yeah that 's it . industrial designer : very long presentation . project manager : yes , but it has your name on it . user interface : project manager : user interface : industrial designer : well that does n't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . um so , somehow that thing 's too big , but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . they say they could put it to work but um we do n't think so . user interface : no . industrial designer : no . it it it you 'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and user interface : if the tv is working , yeah . project manager : user interface : that 's just i mean it 'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it 's gon na change the channel . industrial designer : yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , user interface : so industrial designer : and i think that 's one of the things we wan na keep . project manager : but what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? so if you pressed it and went , up ? industrial designer : that kinda would r d user interface : well then why do n't you just press the up button ? project manager : man yeah . industrial designer : yeah . that would kind of lose it . project manager : but if it 's just one thing with a button that you can just go up . user interface : even still there 's gon na be interf th there 's there still will be interference from the tv . marketing : that 's right . project manager : yeah , okay . user interface : it might not be it might not be completely confusing , but i think you 'll still y it 's still marketing : user interface : i do n't think it 's practical at all . i think it 's a bad idea frankly . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah so um taking that away , our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable project manager : you guys know your stuff . industrial designer : it 's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls . um as for the point that we making about losing it . well , we wan na small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed , but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost , user interface : that i would believe . industrial designer : about marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : industrial designer : but um yeah i think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we 'll do that . somehow . um so the the what i would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without with a l a less complicated um design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext . project manager : so we 're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ? industrial designer : ye no it 's not user interface : that 's not a scroll wheel . industrial designer : i i it 's just four buttons that are on a cross , project manager : nah . oh okay okay . i see . industrial designer : so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone . user interface : right . project manager : uh , okay . user interface : instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that 's up , down , louder , and quieter . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah um yeah so i think we w we go for something mid-sized , so something looks good marketing : industrial designer : and uh is not too prone to get lost . that be it . project manager : 'kay . so on to y functional requirements or trend watching ? marketing : i dunno . user interface : trend watching has a later date there . marketing : trend watching i guess . trend watching i believe . project manager : forty six nineteen fifty seven . yep . marketing : see what it looks like . it 's been so long . project manager : industrial designer : . marketing : well i do n't know what to say . when i s when i see the when i see the product i i i i do n't wan na buy it . i see so many of 'em out there . there 's nothing about that product that makes me wan na choose that product over other products that are out there . user interface : are you talking about the picture ? that 's not our that 's not our b design , marketing : yeah yeah . user interface : that 's just a that 's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like . marketing : okay . okay . okay 'cause 'cause right now i do n't have too much to say about how to market this product because we do n't have a product to market yet . and uh from from talking to mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now . that 's what i understand so , project manager : upper management said yes . marketing : hello . project manager : uh e excuse that , that 's a bit of spam . marketing : and and so yeah i 'm a i 'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that i 'm gon na market ? uh without special or increased marketable features i do n't believe the product has a consumer demand . uh i like the idea of of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price right now . what are we gon na do to make this one special and unique ? user interface : what 's special and unique about a scroll ? marketing : uh well i do n't project manager : it 's cool . marketing : yeah it 's i i just see it as different . i do n't say it 's specially mm i do n't say it 's special . uh i say that it 's different i what i 'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . i give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , do n't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it 's f at the same price . i need something to market about this thing . we 're we 're a new firm . project manager : i 'd i 'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , marketing : what i if when when we have project manager : but wi with a similar marketing : yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that 's as as a marketing standard i need something to market , to make this product unique . user interface : well right i think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , having it look really nice um and also be really durable . marketing : mm 'kay . just remember when i made up this report i did n't have the information that we 're discussing here . project manager : mm . course . user interface : right yeah . yeah . marketing : and and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what i 'm saying is , from my perspective , i do n't have a product to market right now . um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . that 's that is the next step , there 's technology and then there is technology , which we 're moving into the next phase . project manager : yeah 'cause that 's . industrial designer : marketing : and so uh we 're gon na have some new technology to enhance the marketability . yeah uh again i 'm not sold on the product because we do n't have a product in my opinion yet . so i need a product . project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : well let 's get a product then . marketing : i need a product to market . and i just whatever product you guys put together , we 'll find a way to market it . tha that i 'm not concerned with . project manager : so now marketing : if you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then i need to i need to find a lower cost . project manager : so our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? do we go basic or do we go for features ? uh d does anyone really wan na do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ? user interface : well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? function-wise , what does that do that project manager : oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing ? marketing : yeah wh wh what 's the wh user interface : yeah . well it 's it 's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . project manager : mm 'kay industrial designer : but would we marketing : okay now what i see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . so from a marketing standpoint i have i have another door to walk through when we have something that 's unique . project manager : yeah . marketing : if it creates something more complex or more expensive , then i do n't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . but again , from a marketing perspective i want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we 're we 're co it 's a very competitive market . project manager : what i understand about scroll wheels is they 're they 're quite expensive to to make . user interface : yeah . project manager : so i d user interface : th they are gon na be more expensive , but on the other hand , i mean , it i mean it is an alternative if if you think that 's gon na sell some some uh you know if if we 're gon na make up the extra cost by extra sales i think maybe it 's worth it to do it , but i mean i would just use if i was gon na do this i would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . i do n't think volume or do you think volume would be industrial designer : i dunno . i 'll bet first in volume maybe . i dunno . user interface : no we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but project manager : well i d i like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh dock to put it in to to charge it . we can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : it s i m makes it easy to market , marketing : yeah yeah . project manager : it 's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so . marketing : i think it 's that 's right . i think so . project manager : and if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product 's gon na need to be more durable th thus because you 're not going to be ditching it as often . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : it 's gon na need to be more expensive because of the cradle . so if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well marketing : yep . i think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , user interface : yeah . marketing : and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it 's own demand from it 's uniqueness . project manager : so our big decision then is like how do we do um like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have uh what type of casing ? i personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : user interface : i 'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , where there 's you have plastic bits and then it 's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside . project manager : okay . just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for user interface : well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens i think are are kind of project manager : okay . so then if we d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons , or do we want if we 're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go lcd ? do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ? industrial designer : it 's only a tv . user interface : or from from my perspective i think lcd is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you 're doing i mean it 's you 're not gon na get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there 's just not a lot of information , you know , there . project manager : okay . user interface : it receives no information . so i i do n't see any reason for having an lcd 'cause it 's an increased cost . unless you can think of something interesting to do with it . marketing : yeah . yeah right now there 's right now there 's nothing coming out of the tv to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there 's no s i do n't see the , user interface : right . marketing : i do n't see the necessity of an lcd either . do n't see it . project manager : okay so the question is now i guess we need t to decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing . marketing : project manager : so , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ? marketing : project manager : what what overall things have we not decided on ? user interface : well we have to i think for me it 's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gon na be . there 's the scroll wheel , in or out ? what do you guys like in the user interface ? project manager : i think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gon na make enough of a difference to justify the cost ? marketing : again . well i think it 's it 's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , i believe , for me to market . uh again the push-buttons i i see are are everywhere . and so we can go with the same thing , but we 're gon na be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . you know the other thing i thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? make a remote that does n't look like a remote . it 's just another it 's just a an idea , and i do n't know user interface : well i dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because i think , as far as durability th it 's not a big well maybe when it 's closed . marketing : i mean what i see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : this user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : and what i keep throwing out there i just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : but you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost . project manager : yeah and i guess th th the question th th that you 're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? marketing : oh okay project manager : because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost . marketing : phew . user interface : yeah . marketing : i think you got ta g get into cost effectiveness . i think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , i think those are two very strong features , user interface : well marketing : if that 's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost . user interface : the the locator 's gon na require a radio transmitter , which will marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : that 's gon na n is that gon na need a better chip as well ? user interface : um we 're probably gon na have to go with a like a medium chip , s i would imagine . industrial designer : no it 's just different . user interface : but we i we will need a receiver , an antenna . marketing : integrated , yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so it 's just uh i i think that 's user interface : it should be a really simple signal though so marketing : i know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button i can push to find my remote control . project manager : and it 's presumably gon na need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep . user interface : that 's true yeah . project manager : but i guess a little tiny speaker is gon na be quite cheap , it 's not gon na need q quality , is it ? it 's user interface : oh yeah yeah . it 'll be really cheap . marketing : or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink . project manager : marketing : you can industrial designer : maybe not marketing : project manager : makes your living room more fresh as you watch . marketing : yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager : okay we 're doing well for time here . um we 've got about another ten minutes . i think that uh user interface : so the scroll wheel , in or out ? project manager : mm pr my personal preference is out . i do n't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and i do n't s think it 's obvious and natural how it would be used . industrial designer : yeah . yeah i think we have like and it 's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , 'cause it 's it it breaks down easier . marketing : yeah . user interface : for me i think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . marketing : user interface : i do n't know exactly what the increased cost is gon na be , but i think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they 're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . i think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that . project manager : but then that that surely d depends a little on the tv because some tvs are quite slow at changing channels from like so user interface : sure . project manager : if you 've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you 're actually keeping in pace with the tv 's ability to to change channels . or do you have to go through and you wait for it ? marketing : yeah . project manager : you scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to user interface : well i think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it 's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it 's where it 's quantized into you know certain marketing : oh yeah . project manager : uh i see i see . that 's where you user interface : that was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be . marketing : yeah . project manager : ah i see i see what you 're talking about now . okay . marketing : user interface : it 's just it 's basically it it 's just a f look and feel thing . it has the same exact functionality as two buttons . marketing : i i think there 's you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers , and i see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . project manager : yeah if you 're just sitting there going marketing : instead of going button-to-bu you just j you 'd j j j j j j . user interface : yeah . project manager : that 's kinda cool actually . marketing : i really i really think that 's a really cool thing for surfing . project manager : i like that . user interface : now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of tvs wo n't re the tvs wo n't respond exactly the same . some of them are gon na be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it 'll be like flip , flip , flip . marketing : well there 's ano project manager : well not n necessarily . user interface : but project manager : you could basically make it so that it 'll i mean it 's just gon na be sending a signal to the tv yeah the tv 's ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it 's gon na flip once . user interface : right . marketing : that 's right . project manager : if you do that . user interface : yeah it just might be frustrating where you ca n't make it go as fast as you want , project manager : other than click click click . yeah . user interface : but i think once people get used to it i i do like the idea of the scroll wheel though . project manager : and if we 're marketing it as a high niche product , then we 're gon na be selling it to people who are buying good tvs as well , yeah , presumably . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : primarily . user interface : marketing : yeah i think so . i i think so . now the the only thing i i on the interface side of it , is that i i i see the dilemma . but if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so i can go uh presuming i have , on my television , something that tells me what channel i 'm on , i can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . i know what because it 's on the television . the television tells me what channel it 's on when i change it . so i do n't know that really that 's that 's gon na be a a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . okay ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? you understand what i 'm saying ? user interface : i think i know what you might be getting at , or or project manager : oh i see so if maybe if we had an lcd up the top that just did a number on it , right ? and then it that basically marketing : oh no we could read it from the television . user interface : well , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , project manager : mm . well that 's quite cool . user interface : and it c it project manager : you 'd need a display on the th the thing . user interface : why ? it 'll tell you when you flip the channel on the tv . marketing : yeah the the television can tell you . user interface : yeah . project manager : oh yeah yeah no i see what you 're talking about . yeah that 's kinda cool . how would you program it though ? user interface : well you just it 's one extra button . you say programme start , and then type in marketing : put user interface : 'cause you still have the typing you know you 'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually . project manager : okay okay . user interface : so programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end . project manager : okay and yeah marketing : and then . project manager : and that just basically flips between it and it 'll go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again . user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : yeah that 's kinda cool . i like that . marketing : and again we have another another great marketing tool . we have about three we have three or four things here . project manager : that 's not gon na be too expensive because that 's gon na be you 're gon na be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . you could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology . this may be something that 's available through our own uh through our own services . project manager : might be , but tha that 's not gon na be such a costly feature . the problem we 're gon na have is making it robust . making it last . user interface : oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two . marketing : or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other . project manager : so if there 's a button for each type . user interface : no because you wan na be able to go up and down through the channels . project manager : yeah people are gon na have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they marketing : ah-ha okay . okay , okay , user interface : right . marketing : well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch . project manager : yeah yeah the mode switch . user interface : i think we 'll need a we 'll need a mode switch , but then if we have a mode switch we 're gon na need some kinda indicator project manager : just the lights behind the buttons . user interface : to which , an l_e_ an l_e_d_ project manager : you could have back-lit buttons maybe . user interface : okay . project manager : would that work ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : is that user interface : okay . project manager : okay we have five minutes . so right details th that we 've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel . marketing : project manager : we want a mode indicator . we want back-lit buttons . and if we 're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you 're pressing at the time , so that you know if it 's actually pressed or not . i 've seen some remotes do that . user interface : okay . just so you know i think i mean it was my understanding that before we were gon na stay in the mid-market range . it seems we 're kind of approaching a higher-end range . project manager : i think we are yeah . user interface : i wan na make sure everybody 's okay with that . marketing : yeah yeah . well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this . project manager : yeah well we do n't have it 's not that we have more money , marketing : did n't you say so ? project manager : we can push up the the price . marketing : that 's what i mean . project manager : yeah . marketing : we can increase the cost . user interface : okay . project manager : 'kay . marketing : so i do n't know i do n't know whether having user interface : i just wan na make sure everybody 's on board with it . so project manager : yeah . so we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we have n't got to a stage where we 're ready to pin down the price of components . but i 'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ? marketing : well i think th i think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it 's gon na cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit . project manager : yeah no i i think that 's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand . we 're entering a new market here , user interface : right . project manager : so i think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to marketing : okay i 'm i 'm okay with that . i guess what i just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level . project manager : but th what 's our ballpark as to what we 'd be able to sell something like this for ? user interface : well y yeah . let 's let 's try and think now , how much would you pay for marketing : we have to find cost . user interface : with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your tv remote , how much would you pay for that ? project manager : but you 've got ta think who our target market is because i i 'm not our target market . user interface : i 'm just asking you . project manager : i 'm a student , but on the other hand i would think , mm with my project manager salary , i would think yeah i could probably afford this user interface : if industrial designer : user interface : then you could probably afford this . project manager : uh would i buy it ? maybe . if i had a cool new tv and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which i think 's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little . then maybe you know . i do i do n't think i 'd go over a hundred euro certainly , that would be way too much , user interface : oh no no . project manager : but the i would be happy paying over forty for it , i guess , but not much user interface : i would say thirty five to forty . marketing : yeah , i was gon na say thirty five to fifty . project manager : 'kay . thirty five to fifty euros is our sales bracket okay . so the question is what we ca we make it for . user interface : okay . marketing : because one of th one of the things we 're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television . user interface : right . marketing : it 's one of the marketing features in this . project manager : that 's why the scroll needs to be really robust . industrial designer : okay so we 'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator . user interface : with a cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and it 's gon na look sexy . industrial designer : or not . user interface : or not . it might look like clay . industrial designer : okay so you can market pe depending on that ? marketing : yeah yeah . bas th that 's that 's easy . that 's that 's not a , it 's a . 'cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone . industrial designer : cool . marketing : under the title of uniquenesses . project manager : okay . the next meeting starts in thirty minutes , although does it ? it starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . so we 've got more than a thirty minutes . um we 've got more like fifty . marketing : well i have is my three twenty one is the next meeting ? project manager : the the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah . marketing : that 's that 's almost uh fifty minutes . project manager : yeah that is . uh they 've they 've changed the times from the presentations . marketing : you guys can you guys you guys can uh create a all kinds of things . user interface : probably . we 'll let you know when we 're done , if we can go earlier . marketing : thanks , yeah . project manager : okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh user interface : yeah . project manager : okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing 's gon na do , look like , how it 's gon na work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ? user interface : i do n't think so . if we have any questions we 'll just email you i guess . industrial designer : project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah i think it pretty much everything 's covered . project manager : okay . this one was quite easy . industrial designer : coulda been worse . project manager : always the optimist . marketing : still . industrial designer : yes i am . project manager : 'kay thanks guys ."
