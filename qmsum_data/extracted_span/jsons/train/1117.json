    "answer": "industrial designer : okay . gon na talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . right . so unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it , marketing : project manager : industrial designer : so um i 'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . um just this is the basic basic premise of a remote control . um the basic function is to send messages to another system . okay so much is clear . an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . often in the form of infrared bits . this is the most mostly used . um there 's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . um parts are cheaper as well . a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . this is where my people screwed up basically . marketing : industrial designer : so i 'm going to explain that on the board rather . um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . we 'll start with an energy source . right . um which is usually a battery right ? since it 's not feasible to add a cable to that . this energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself . uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . right ? this is the user interface and there we have the chip . um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . that sends out the signal . of course the signal differs accordingly . um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . and of course that 's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . the way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it 's working basically . you press something , you get a response . which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . now this , what we 're talking about here , or what i think should be discussed are these two components mostly . the the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . what we probably can not alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . we can not change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . right ? these two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . it c it does n't have to be there . this can be discussed as well . the user interface . that 's something we can also discuss . um as we 've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . speech recognition um interface , we do n't know that . or if we just do the usual button thing . or we have a touch pad or something like that that 's something we can discuss . and of course the energy source . batteries . solar cells . who knows ? of course it 's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough , developed enough . but that 's like i s i suppose rather up to marketing , and not to project manager : so we could the the industrial designer : to the industrial design department . project manager : the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive industrial designer : expensive it 's gon na be get uh . yeah . project manager : but people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so possibly it might be worth the investment ."
