    "query": "<s> what did industrial design think about functional features to include in the remote ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : in fact i have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . the push button are usually extremely cheap , but i just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . project manager : okay . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and i think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . project manager : okay . industrial designer : uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . user interface : yeah . project manager : but is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? because we can afford up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control . industrial designer : yeah . yeah project manager : so will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve euros to produce ? industrial designer : i i th but i do n't think that uh we should we should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . yeah but i think it 's yeah sorry , i have n't written my personal references . um the i i just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , project manager : okay . industrial designer : and if we could reduce that . we we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . user interface : mm-hmm . i have a question about that actually . um , what is the purpose of the light ? industrial designer : just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber user interface : is project manager : you can easily find the button in the dark or so ? user interface : but but in th in the dark uh yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? project manager : it will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control i think , no ? user interface : but if you move it then you have it , you do n't need to find it . you can see the buttons better , of course . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . true . industrial designer : yeah . actually . user interface : but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . industrial designer : as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . user interface : yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ? industrial designer : yeah . again . user interface : yeah no it 's too expensive . industrial designer : i do n't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be user interface : okay . mm . extra . yeah , okay . mm . yeah , but i expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , industrial designer : first of all i was thinking to have a a continuous light user interface : yeah ."
