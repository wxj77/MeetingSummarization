    "answer": "industrial designer : okay , that 's fine . um . okay , now work a little with me . okay . well , project manager : industrial designer : let 's start it as it is . okay , uh the method . there are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? i 'll tell you why that 's important to me . um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that 's why i also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh i heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . project manager : yeah . of course , hmm . industrial designer : so it 's that 's not as easy as it s might look like . user interface : okay . industrial designer : uh material study , i 'm working on that um for the the costs . i have to check out how far i can go with that . normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , i think we can just go on with that . um then i 've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . the more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper . project manager : you mean integrate them all into the circuit board . okay . industrial designer : exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that 's cheaper . project manager : yeah , okay . industrial designer : so we have to make something that 's not too difficult in design again . project manager : so you have industrial designer : this is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . you have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . the switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a morse code , that 's how you should see it . the morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . you have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it ? uh a light in indication , light that you know that it 's functioning . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh here again , that 's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different morse code when some button is pressed . that makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . uh i do n't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light . project manager : okay . okay . that was it ?"
