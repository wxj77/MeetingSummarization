    "query": "<s> according to marketing , why was the revolution of interaction necessary ?",
    "answer": "marketing : alright . thank you very much . um . one of the the biggest issues i found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and i think that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . so um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . and if we devote some energy into this , i think the um recent productions of real reaction , the i go everywhere power and the high definition d_v_d_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , i think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . and um in fact i think the high definition d_v_d_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool . so again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . um fifty percent i think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . and eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , d_v_d_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . industrial designer : could can i ask where these figures come from , is this market research we 've marketing : um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . project manager : now in between , as the project manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : um that teletext is outdated um marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for tv um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan ."
