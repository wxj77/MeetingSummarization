i suppose it has a lon oh my god . right . yous know what it 's supposed to be . industrial designer : okay . user interface : it 's a dog . . um , i like dogs because , um , they 're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they 're just such friendly animals . and , like they 're more of a companion than cats . industrial designer : yeah , that 's true . user interface : i 've nothing against cats . cats do n't really like me , so i ca n't like them . project manager : marketing : user interface : but they 're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , project manager : user interface : that do n't look like that . industrial designer : marketing : alrighty . i feel like a robot . user interface : project manager : industrial designer : marketing : okay . um , well i guess i had the most time to think about it . i 'm going to draw a butterfly , because i saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of spring arriving . and it was actually the prettiest butterfly i 've ever seen out in the wild , and i though that was pretty cool in scotland . it was like , well it was a little pointier than that . at first i thought it was a dead leaf . user interface : marketing : and then it landed on the wall next to me . but this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . and then it kinda there was a green , i think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this . project manager : it 's kinda like a peacock . user interface : marketing : yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was this part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and i 'm like , wow this is the middle of scotland in like march . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : so i thought that was pretty cool . and it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . i wish i 'd had my camera . so that 's gon na be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like spring is finally here . yeah . industrial designer : very nice . marketing : there you go . project manager : great . marketing : uh , what do we oh . project manager : do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? marketing : yes i do . project manager : yea right . marketing : project manager : so , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , industrial designer : okay . project manager : um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we 'll be looking at , um , wan na make this um selling price of twenty five euros . and so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . um , we 'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million euro . i 'm assuming that 's what the m_ means . um , and make it for an international market . um , one thing we 'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , v_c_r_s . things like that , depending on which country you are . another thing for the design team to think about . um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve euro and fifty cents . marketing : okay , so we 'll have a hundred percent profit then ? twelve fifty . project manager : i 'm bad at math . marketing : okay . project manager : 'kay . um , industrial designer : project manager : so now that , um , that is underway , um industrial designer : project manager : it is discussion time . so this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . does anyone have any initial thoughts ? marketing : i find that in the dark it 's often hard to know what button you 're pushing . project manager : mm-hmm . so what 's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ? industrial designer : okay . marketing : um industrial designer : i always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . project manager : industrial designer : it 's always , where is the remote control ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . project manager : industrial designer : i dunno , some kind of alarm . you can press a button on your wall , signal , project manager : yeah . it 's a great idea . it 's a great idea . user interface : industrial designer : 'cause it always gets lost . user interface : do yous not find that , um , like , there 's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you do n't know what half of them do . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , that you do n't use half of them . project manager : user interface : yeah , i do n't know what they do . marketing : mm-hmm . there 's some remote controls where there 's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you do n't really use unless you 're programming or something . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , that 's , that 's marketing : that 's useful . industrial designer : yeah , it is . yeah . marketing : so you just have like the number buttons , power button , tv video button . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : alright . anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like marketing : project manager : any ideas will do that you have at this point . marketing : could be shaped like a conch , project manager : can hold it . industrial designer : a novelty . user interface : marketing : you know . be like a shell-shaped remote . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : are we going into kind of novelty factors here . like , i 've seen phones like a project manager : well if it 's a trendy original , um , aspect we 're going for . industrial designer : okay . project manager : i mean , you 're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wan na go in , industrial designer : yeah . mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . project manager : but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . industrial designer : yeah . i suppose , if we 're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable user interface : yeah . marketing : . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but we do n't wan na go towards boring , 'cause that would n't sell either . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so , hmm . project manager : and the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : right . okay we have five minutes left . so , just to cover we have one more thing . um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . or not present but bring to the meeting . um , i_d_ , whatever that stands for . industrial designer : industrial designer . marketing : interface ? project manager : industrial designer . industrial designer : that 's me . marketing : oh , industrial . project manager : i have to remember these things . um . you 'll be beginning your , your working design . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : um , u_i_d_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . um , maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag marketing expert . marketing : marketing expert . project manager : um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . and i 'll see you in half an hour , okay ?
