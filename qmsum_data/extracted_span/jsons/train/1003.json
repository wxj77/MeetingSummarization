    "query": "<s> summarize the whole meeting .",
    "answer": "project manager : okay . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so we are here for the concept design meeting . so , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we 've taken . uh i will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . so each of you will uh show us the various investigation they 've done during uh previous uh hours . we 'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . so , last time we decided to have a simple interface . we also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the tv . we have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no lcd no voice features . so now uh we will have three presentations . so the conceptual specification by industrial designer , the specification of the u_i_ by or u_i_ user interface : abdul al-hasred is my name . project manager : okay . and uh the last point is uh trend watching by market expert . so maybe we can start with uh industrial design . so this is the presentation . industrial designer : uh , i_d_ you want ? project manager : maybe i can switch slide uh on your request . industrial designer : yeah . i only v have three slides , so . i just look at the mm um just this . on some web pages to find some documentation project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and i think a remote control is , as i s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . so uh uh i was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh i just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . and um yeah we can change directly . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : in fact i have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . the push button are usually extremely cheap , but i just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . project manager : okay . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and i think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . project manager : okay . industrial designer : uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . user interface : yeah . project manager : but is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? because we can afford up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control . industrial designer : yeah . yeah project manager : so will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve euros to produce ? industrial designer : i i th but i do n't think that uh we should we should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . user interface : yeah . also have to say industrial designer : but user interface : did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? industrial designer : um that 's all project manager : you received something industrial designer : yeah . i have n't chec user interface : yeah . you we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . says yeah . it says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . but i guess it could be project manager : and could it be adapted ? user interface : i guess it 's possible . i mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command . project manager : okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ? user interface : yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip project manager : okay . yeah . user interface : then we we could use it . project manager : okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah but i think it 's yeah sorry , i have n't written my personal references . um the i i just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , project manager : okay . industrial designer : and if we could reduce that . we we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . user interface : mm-hmm . i have a question about that actually . um , what is the purpose of the light ? industrial designer : just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber user interface : is project manager : you can easily find the button in the dark or so ? user interface : but but in th in the dark uh yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? project manager : it will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control i think , no ? user interface : but if you move it then you have it , you do n't need to find it . you can see the buttons better , of course . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . true . industrial designer : yeah . actually . user interface : but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . industrial designer : as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . user interface : yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ? industrial designer : yeah . again . user interface : yeah no it 's too expensive . industrial designer : i do n't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be user interface : okay . mm . extra . yeah , okay . mm . yeah , but i expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , industrial designer : first of all i was thinking to have a a continuous light user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device user interface : mm . mm-hmm . project manager : but it can be uh battery consuming , no ? to have the light always on ? industrial designer : yeah , a little bit . a little bit . project manager : well we will discuss that after maybe industrial designer : yeah . project manager : the other presentations . user interface : . so uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder . project manager : yeah . user interface : so . it was last time i saw it . project manager : and it is . user interface : okay . so , project manager : okay . user interface : just move to the next slide . so basically want very simple , right ? that 's the major idea , as simple as possible . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : so i just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . and let 's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . and in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we do n't need and it become even simpler . project manager : yeah . user interface : um . so . project manager : and also does it uh fit well in hand ? because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage . user interface : yeah . well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so . we have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . project manager : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : and on the left one is exactly the same . so it 's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? project manager : yeah . user interface : these are the basic thing . project manager : so it 's only the central part . user interface : so basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . project manager : yeah . with a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . user interface : yeah , if you have , for example i think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . project manager : yeah . user interface : it could be on the right side , for example . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . because we do n't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . and i think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because project manager : okay . user interface : you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . project manager : okay . s user interface : uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . project manager : okay . will be down or user interface : so that they 're separate a bit , project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . uh and it 's easy to press the other the big buttons , but uh , it 's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . mm . yeah , i think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user . project manager : okay . user interface : alright , you wo n't yeah . usually what i have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally do n't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . that you want to protect a bit . and i think it 's uh it 's reasonable . project manager : okay . user interface : so , i do n't think yeah , this is just the the wheel . we could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . project manager : yeah . maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : because otherwise it 's pretty standard apart the fact that it 's very simple . so maybe it 's worse to uh to have more expense on that 's that aspect . industrial designer : to s mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , i guess the market researcher will tell us all about that . project manager : okay . so we can move to the is there any question ? for designer of user interface ? or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? okay . marketing : okay , i can go ? project manager : yeah . marketing : can i ? so now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . so , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . and um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative . project manager : okay . marketing : and the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . so , are things we are we have uh speak about before . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . and um so you you can go project manager : yeah . marketing : after . and there is a fashion watchers in paris and milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . so , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form project manager : okay . marketing : something like that , or industrial designer : i support an apple . marketing : and the mm the material is expected to be spongy . project manager : marketing : uh i do n't know which material can be spongy , project manager : yeah . marketing : and if you project manager : this is good also for user interface : well , wou wou i think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : it it would work , right ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah . user interface : you can throw it to the television . project manager : yeah , because it 's robust . marketing : okay industrial designer : yeah . me too . marketing : it 's robust , yeah . user interface : hey that 's a cool one . we could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . project manager : marketing : user interface : when it d uh takes a shock . marketing : not good . project manager : uh sorry ? industrial designer : ah it 's okay . i know that they do that for alarm clock also . user interface : yeah . marketing : an and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that . you ca uh you can go uh before project manager : no . yeah . before ? marketing : , before , yes . and you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use . project manager : yeah . yeah . yeah . i think it 's innovative to use the mm the wheel because i think no one else has . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah that 's why project manager : has it ? marketing : yeah that 's why i think we have to keep that if it 's possible . project manager : yeah . i think it 's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : innovative . mm . project manager : so i think it 's a good aspect and it should be kept . user interface : how do we make it look cool is the question . project manager : cool , fancy ? user interface : yeah . project manager : we have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that . industrial designer : what about um marketing : mm . oh , colour , yeah . user interface : well the obvious thing is a banana , i guess . marketing : oh i i project manager : maybe yeah . industrial designer : marketing : i thought about a a pear , for example . you know the pear , is like that and it 's it 's easy to to have in in hand project manager : yeah , and it 's ergonomic as well . marketing : and uh yeah . project manager : a pear . user interface : the banana is also ergonomic . marketing : project manager : yeah . maybe pear yeah or something like that . marketing : or a fruit like that . i dunno . project manager : yeah . we can discuss that uh . d d is is there anything you want to add ? user interface : is there any fruit that is spongy ? marketing : project manager : i do n't think so . i think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . user interface : yeah . marketing : project manager : something like that . industrial designer : and for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue l_e_d_ inside ? project manager : but that 's not in the trend . . user interface : you can make it um marketing : project manager : the trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : it 's not hard , the metal . marketing : project manager : i think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : user interface : plastic . project manager : so , i think we can keep the wheel because it 's uh easy , it 's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have . what kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your tv with ? marketing : industrial designer : banana i think , it 's a nice idea . project manager : banana is also yellow so you you ca n't lost your remote control then . industrial designer : because but marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you y you do n't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , user interface : two of the button , yeah . industrial designer : but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : and here you have a a push button to marketing : but you do n't have project manager : i think it 's a good idea , yeah . user interface : yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so you can have it on on two sides and it 'll be cool , project manager : yeah . i think it 's a good design and it 's innovative as well then . maybe we can keep the banana . and it will be very easy to find . industrial designer : and everybody knows what is a banana . user interface : you can put also vibrator inside . industrial designer : basically . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : if you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha user interface : ah-ha . you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : oh , yeah marketing : project manager : yeah it 's really uh really a good point . user interface : yeah . i hope the students of management die , marketing : user interface : but anyway . marketing : user interface : now who are recording this meeting ? project manager : i think it so one second . so we have to take some decision on this aspect . so , uh so for marketing : project manager : sorry , for uh component , so industrial designer : so project manager : we have to think about those aspects , sorry . industrial designer : so we will just use a a standard battery ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . uh what do you mean by case ? project manager : i think it 's the box that should be spongy , banana 's shape . industrial designer : yeah . uh i mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , does n't matter . project manager : industrial designer : i just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that 's it . user interface : the only th yeah . y yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . industrial designer : yeah yeah . yeah . user interface : but uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be industrial designer : spongy also . user interface : i mean if it 's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to i mean if it 's spongy then it 's going to move , right ? so , it 's going to be bend a lot . project manager : but industrial designer : oh no i think it 's possible . user interface : so if we try to push the buttons , it project manager : no the button would be user interface : you think it 's possible ? project manager : in fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . industrial designer : yeah . yeah user interface : okay . industrial designer : . this is uh like the user interface : yeah . project manager : okay odd shape with spongy cover . and standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there 's no specific problem . so we agree to put the wheel industrial designer : mm-hmm . wheel on the top . button , where do we want some buttons ? user interface : well , usually hold 'kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so it have to it has to be symmetrical . user interface : uh yeah but okay . sa let 's say that th o it has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . project manager : user interface : basically . or you could use use this one , but i do n't know if it 's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . project manager : yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable . user interface : this for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? project manager : yeah i think it 's okay for both right and left . mm . user interface : should have the two sides . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so if the left , we have the op project manager : i think you can turn it this way also . you can do both with both hands . user interface : wheel wheel buttons . project manager : i think it 's okay . user interface : yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . so you can not see them . project manager : well , you you will get used to it . user interface : yeah . project manager : and moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . user interface : so the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be y yeah i know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . project manager : yeah . no you you i think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . i think for lefty it 's okay . i can do this movement , and for righty as well . i think this does n't change that much . user interface : okay . project manager : yeah ? user interface : okay . maybe . yeah . project manager : so , for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side . and and uh a wheel on the top . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . project manager : so the colour is yellow . i think it 's uh we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , yeah . so maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . so have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . and have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product . that is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . it seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : so so to prepare the prototype i would suggest that the industrial designer and the user interface designer uh work together . that would uh industrial designer : project manager : be better , i think . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and uh and so uh you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so user interface : yes master . project manager : do you need to add anything ? you feel okay ? user interface : yeah . project manager : you feel uh free to express what you want to say ? you do n't feel too constrained ? user interface : yeah . project manager : you do n't feel free to answer this ? industrial designer : user interface : maybe you can make uh uh mm project manager : okay , so user interface : okay . industrial designer : thank you ."
