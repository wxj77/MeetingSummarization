    "query": "<s> what did the meeting discuss about the effect of the welsh baccalaureate on wider education provisions ?",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . the next questions are from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : this is about the wider impact of studying the welsh bac on other curriculum subjects and education provision , and we 've had representations in that it is causing some concerns . so , do you have any concerns about the effect that the welsh bac may be having on wider education provisions , such as the narrowing of the curriculum at key stage 4 ? kirsty williams am : no . obviously , schools are responsible for planning their local curriculum offer , and that needs to meet the needs of their learners , and it also needs to meet the needs of the learning and skills ( wales ) measure 2009 . so , there should be a wide variety of choices available . i believe that the skills challenge certificate actually does ensure that there is a broad curriculum and that children are exposed to different learning opportunities . and so , rather than narrowing it , i believe the welsh bac helps us to make sure that there is an expansive curriculum , and that lots of different issues are explored in the skills challenge certificate that ensure not just academic skills are developed , but , actually , knowledge and skills of a wider range of subjects about you and your place in the world is available via this qualification . janet finch-saunders am : okay , thanks . and then , to what extent do you think that the welsh bac should be give priority over other curriculum subjects ? kirsty williams am : well , i do n't think it's\u2014 . it should n't be at the expense of other subjects . it should be part of that wide range of opportunities that are afforded to students , and i do n't think it 's more important or less important than other aspects of what we already ask schools to deliver . janet finch-saunders am : what about where we 've taken representations that there 's a lack of capacity in terms of all the extra pressures of studying the welsh bac along with other qualifications ? i went to a school in bangor , and , again , as has been said here , it 's very polarised , the evidence that we 're taking\u2014either some have found it very easy or some , including teachers , have found it extremely difficult to fit everything in , and they do believe that there is a lack of capacity there . kirsty williams am : and the onerous nature and the consequences of workload for teachers is acknowledged by the qualifications wales work and review into the qualification , and that is one of the things that we 're looking to address so that the assessment arrangements and workload implications for teachers are not too onerous . and , if there is any element of duplication\u2014students being asked to do things over and over\u2014then that needs to be addressed as well , and that 's why there is this review by the design group . janet finch-saunders am : okay , thanks . and then , how do you respond to concerns that learners are avoiding studying the welsh bac\u2014 where they can , that is\u2014by attending institutions in england or institutions that do not offer welsh-medium provision ? kirsty williams am : well , it 's interesting , is n't it , about where children choose to study and whether they are motivated by the avoidance of the welsh bac ? people make decisions about where to study for a whole host of reasons , and it 's difficult sometimes to quantify what those are . so , for instance , we often hear this along the border that , because\u2014 . the geography is not easy , but it can be relatively easy to go across into the english system and therefore you do n't have to do this . now , the reasons for that could be very variable . it could be about the nature of the offer . we know that , in some of our rural schools , the secondary sixth forms are n't able to offer a wide variety of a-levels , and perhaps , by going to a different institution , a larger institution across the way , then you can get that combination of the a-levels you want to do , which simply is n't possible if you do it in your home school . or , we do have some consortia arrangements where a-levels are delivered across a wide variety of schools , which require students to travel . some students do n't want to do that ; they do n't want to do their a-levels in three different schools , but they 'd rather go to an institution where they can do it all under one roof . and that means , sometimes , moving across the border or , in the area i live , children making the decision to go to merthyr college , because its a lovely , beautiful new building , the facilities are absolutely fantastic and a wide variety of a-levels is available under one roof . we looked at , in particular , also , the perception of quality . so , if we take the example of king henry viii school in abergavenny , a school where , in the past , there have been , i think , within the community , some concerns about the quality of that school\u2014whether it 's regarded as a good school . and , from that particular location , you can quite easily get to hereford college\u2014a college that has a fantastic offer , does very , very well and has a beautiful building . what we do , if we look at the tracking of the students who have been retained in king henry viii , as that school has been on its improvement journey and has done better and better and better , the number of students that they are retaining into their sixth form has grown . so , the perception is , 'this is a good school , i 'm going to get a good-quality experience here ' , and more and more students are choosing to stay in that school than perhaps make the decision to travel somewhere else . we also have to recognise that , for some students , staying in the sixth form is n't what they want to do ; they want a different experience , they want to go to an fe college . they want a different experience . so , we have to take into consideration that students could be motivated by a wide variety of subjects , and there 's no hard-and-fast evidence that it is avoidance of the bac that is the sole driver for some of these choices . lynne neagle am : si\u00e2n , on this . sian gwenllian am : the evidence that we 've had from one of the teaching unions\u2014robust and clear evidence\u2014is that this is happening , that is , that young people are leaving wales to go over the border to schools in england in order to avoid the welsh bac . that 's exactly what was said to us . but you do n't accept that evidence . kirsty williams am : i 'm not saying that i do n't accept it . i 'm saying that i think there are a wide variety of reasons why students make decisions about where to study . i 'm not aware of any comprehensive piece of work that has looked at those motivations , and i think there could be a whole host of reasons why children are deciding to move across the border . perhaps the welsh bac is an easy one to place that hook on , and that 's easier to acknowledge , is n't it , than saying that perhaps students are making that choice for other reasons . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . the next questions , then , are on teacher learning from suzy . suzy davies am : actually , i 've asked the question that i wanted to ask . lynne neagle am : okay , you do n't want to\u2014 suzy davies am : by all means you ask the others i had . lynne neagle am : okay . you have referred to training already . the committee 's got two concerns , really . one is about preparedness in ite to teach the welsh bac , so i do n't know if you want to expand on how teachers are being skilled up at that level to deliver the welsh bac effectively . kirsty williams am : in the accreditation process , which has not been without its pain , and some significant decisions made in that regard , the criteria for the ite programmes note that , and i 'm going to quote it : 'teachers should be able to help children and young people to make links across their learning , bringing together different aspects to examine , for example , important topics such as citizenship , enterprise , financial capability and sustainability . ' so , the prime driver for our ite reforms , obviously , is the preparedness for 'successful futures ' , but in preparing our teachers to be in a position to successfully deliver that , those are also the pedagogical principles and that shift in pedagogy that we see aligned to the welsh baccalaureate . so , it is actually a part of the accreditation process that the curriculum that the new ite providers will have to deliver\u2014ensuring that teachers have those skills and have that confidence to be able to deliver their teaching in a way that , as i said , ensures that we successfully deliver on donaldson , but also on the same pedagogical principles that are needed for the successful delivery of the welsh bac . suzy davies am : in the pre-donaldson period , then , bearing in mind what you 've just said , do you expect to see a surge in improvement on how the baccalaureate is taken up by those schools that are currently less keen on it ? kirsty williams am : i hope that we will see increased numbers of students taking the qualification and an increase in the quality of that experience for young people . as we discussed earlier , we 're not just waiting for the new graduates to come out of our ite providers . there 's a whole cohort of the workforce already out there . they should be given an equal opportunity to ensure that they have the skills to deliver on our curriculum reforms and our reform qualifications , and every time the previous government has brought in a reformed qualification there have been specific resources made available to ensure that teachers are in a position to do that . so , when we changed to maths numeracy , a new qualification that was to be examined , there was specific resource made available for the professional learning for teachers to make sure that they were in a position to do that , and that 's exactly the same as the offer that we have available for teachers who are delivering the welsh bac . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . and you 've already said about continuing professional development , that this is going to be a core part of the cpd . is there anything that you want to add on that ? is it going to be fully integrated into the professional learning offer ? kirsty williams am : yes , absolutely . there is already\u2014i do n't want to make the impression that there 's not already support available out there . there is already support out there via regional consortia for professional learning with regard to the welsh baccalaureate . there is existing support available from the wjec with regard to welsh baccalaureate , and it will continue , as we drive forward our national approach to professional learning . and , increasingly , there are interesting ways in which we 're supporting students , so i do n't know if members are aware of the new mooc . the university of bath , one of the russell group universities , delivered a mooc for the extended project qualification in england . lynne neagle am : what 's a mooc ? [ laughter . ] kirsty williams am : so , it is an online\u2014a massive open online course . so , it 's a course that is delivered free of charge , and it 's delivered by information technology . so , the university of bath have done this mooc to support students with the epq . they have just launched , in conjunction with aberystwyth university , a bilingual mooc for the individual project for welsh bac . it 's our understanding it is the first ever welsh-medium mooc , we think ; we 're not aware of any others . and this resource is there for students to give them advice on how they do choose the thesis for their individual project : how do you go about , then , undertaking good independent research ; how do you reference properly , to ensure that you do that correctly ? and we 've seen over 1,000 students already sign up for the mooc . so , increasingly , there are lots and lots of new resources out there for both teachers and students to make the most of . and the fact that bath and aberystwyth have worked together on this , i believe , shows their commitment and a demonstration of their support for this qualification , otherwise why would the university of bath bother , if they were n't interested in it ?"
