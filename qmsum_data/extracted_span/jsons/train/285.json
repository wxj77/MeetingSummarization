    "answer": "project manager : so i think before talking about the other thing , it 's important thing it 's the case . industrial designer : project manager : uh what what are gon na be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . for example for the for the lcd , if we choose to have a small device , we can not use this um a such a a a screen . industrial designer : uh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that 's the problem . well what what would you guess as a shape ? or what what would be the shape ? user interface : mm . i think i think their being uh large or small is not important . the only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . so let 's say an average size , okay , and it should not be very heavy also . and i prefer to is it should n't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . so we c it 's like like some joysticks . you can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it 's it 's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . so the general shape should be like this . i think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . so uh seven not seven but let 's say five by ten it 's i think it 's that 's my opinion . it 's easier . industrial designer : okay . marketing : which is the same area . industrial designer : okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : could you re could you redesign your board ? industrial designer : five to ten . well that marketing : oh , five five centimetres by ten centimetres . industrial designer : yeah , right . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , i think it 's feasib well one um um how could we do it ? we could put the board next to , well , under the lcd and for example make the lcd be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : like holding something , and the lcd to be just on top of it , you know somehow . well but maybe let 's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . project manager : oh . i 've i s i think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller lcd , if it 's possible . industrial designer : well fi five to ten it would be feasible . okay , so five to ten , i i think it 's it 's feasible . project manager : okay . so we are agree with a small industrial designer : i 'll make it . user interface : or uh or i do n't know project manager : lcd . industrial designer : fo five by ten . user interface : but i do n't want to now invent something new , because we did n't discuss about it . so using some lcds we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , i dunno the name , lcd responding to fingers . project manager : yeah . user interface : touching the screen . something like project manager : tactile or something , yeah . user interface : mm like tactile . marketing : mm , touch screen . project manager : touch screen , yeah . user interface : so but for now if we do n't want to use such kind of screens i i think we using a a smaller screen is better , project manager : yeah . user interface : because project manager : the problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we can not do something very new . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : project manager : so let 's go for a small lcd . marketing : so industrial designer : okay , so yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me user interface : a smaller s project manager : yeah okay . user interface : okay . project manager : so , five by s ten . industrial designer : and i will work it out . project manager : um so what about , so the case we talked about . um something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? my first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , i thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and industrial designer : seven to ten banana . project manager : a big banana . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : okay . rather mango or something or . project manager : um . marketing : well it 's it 's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : i mean what other what other fruit and vegetables project manager : but it 's just an idea . i dunno what you think about , but marketing : do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : i dunno if it can fit with the technology . you are the specialists of that . industrial designer : you mean banana . project manager : industrial designer : well , but if it 's if it if the banana is big enough . project manager : so marketing : user interface : industrial designer : then , yes . but if you want to look at the screen , no . well user interface : project manager : yeah , and industrial designer : user interface : i think this is not good . project manager : the screen has to be square ? or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves . industrial designer : well , it can be whatever you want . project manager : it could . industrial designer : but if it 's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . but if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . marketing : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : it 's like more more expensive to have shape like that . but i do n't care . you know , if we fit this requirement . marketing : well i 'd like a shaped screen . i think that 's more important than saving a bit of money on on the t_f_t_ screen . industrial designer : okay project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one . project manager : yeah . yeah , it should remember banana , but it 's not does n't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . industrial designer : but user interface : industrial designer : like modified banana , okay . project manager : so we are agree with the banana thing ? industrial designer : well it we 'll stick to banana , or ? user interface : okay . marketing : yeah , banana 's good . project manager : okay . industrial designer : okay . marketing : okay ."
