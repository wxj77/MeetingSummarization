    "query": "<s> summarize the debates on the governmental issue of allocating the fund and dealing with the systematic racism .",
    "answer": "mr. yves-franois blanchet : if the idea is so good and wonderful , why not start over and open the dialogue now ? what 's stopping the prime minister from being a rallying point and inviting us to take to each other and resolve the problem , rather than saying that he is going to pack up his toys and go home ? the people with disabilities are the ones who will pay the price . where was the prime minister on october21,2019 ? he received a minority mandate from quebeckers and canadians . why is he behaving like something between a prime minister with a majority and a monarch by divine right ? right hon . justin trudeau : i 've heard the conservative party and the bloc qubcois throw their accusations around . they do n't point out that the house of commons did indeed give its consent to extend the mandate of the special committee on the covid-19 pandemic until the end of june . three parties agreed , which was the right thing to do in the context of this minority government . we 've been working with the other parties . however , as they did not get the results they wanted , they complained . unfortunately , they too are part of a minority parliament and must respect the voice of the majority of parliamentarians , just as we do . mr. yves-franois blanchet : i might have been tempted , but that 's unlikely to happen because the prime minister is n't me , he 's him . it 's therefore up to him to bring people together , open a dialogue and recall parliament . all we were asking for was the opportunity to talk for an hour or two . however , suddenly he does n't want to play anymore . it 's not working anymore , and there 's something a bit strange about that . in addition , the government wants to buy the right to interfere in provincial and quebec jurisdictions for $ 14billion . however , quebec and a number of provinces are refusing to allow it to interfere in their jurisdictions and are asking that this money be paid to them unconditionally . is the prime minister trying to take advantage of the crisis or is he trying to create a constitutional crisis ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , the safety of canadians is the responsibility of all levels of government . that 's why we have proposed a $ 14billion agreement to ensure that all canadians across the country experience a safe re-opening of the economy . this is a proposal that we are working on with the provinces because we know that there are needs across the country , including early childhood centres , screening and support for municipalities . the federal government wants to be there to help the provinces . the chair : we 'll now go to mr.singh . mr. jagmeet singh ( burnaby south , ndp ) : thank you very much , mr . chair . indigenous leaders have expressed a lack of confidence in the rcmp commissioner 's ability to tackle full-scale systemic racism , but the prime minister has expressed his confidence in the commissioner . what 's that based on ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , over the past two years , commissioner lucki has made significant strides forward on an issue where there is still much more to do . we know that systemic racism exists in all of our institutions across this country the chair : we 'll now go back to mr. singh . mr. jagmeet singh : this is the same rcmp commissioner who just recently said that they could n't explain what systemic racism was . now the prime minister says that he has confidence , when indigenous leaders express their lack of confidence . why does the prime minister believe that the rcmp commissioner can tackle systemic racism in the rcmp ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , systemic racism is something that touches every corner of our country , every corner of our institutions . it requires people to understand and move forward in coordinated ways with partners . the commissioner is committed to doing that , alongside members of our government . we will do that together and work with indigenous communities and black the chair : mr. singh . mr. jagmeet singh : mr . chair , recent events have made it abundantly clear that to tackle the systemic racism at the level of the rcmp , we need a full-scale overhaul of the rcmp . is the prime minister committed to a full-scale overhaul of the rcmp to root out systemic racism ? right hon . justin trudeau : as i 've said many times , mr . chair , i am committed to addressing systemic racism in this country and taking significant , bold actions to reduce the amount of discrimination that indigenous peoples , that racialized canadians face on a daily basis . we have much work to do , but we will do it together . mr. jagmeet singh : mr . chair , black lives matter has been calling for governments to defund the police . what it 's saying is that we need to be better at where we spend our money , investing in communities and not policing . will the prime minister commit to a review of the rcmp budget to allocate resources to community services and not to policing ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , over the past years we have been investing more directly and more money in community organizations , in the black community , and working with indigenous partners on the path to reconciliation . we have been investing in the kinds of community-based programs and solutions that are part of the solution . we know there is much more to do , and we will continue to look at all of our expenditures to make sure we 're doing the right things . mr. jagmeet singh : mr . chair , over the past few years , while the prime minister has been in office , the rcmp budget has increased by 31 % . more money is going towards policing . in recent events we 've seen people who needed a health care response to a health care crisis been killed by the rcmp . does the prime minister believe that we need to be investing in a health care response instead of a police response for people who are faced with a crisis ?"
