    "answer": "professor a : so i th i think that the uh but that 's that 's using uh a a pretty huge amount of data , mostly not digits , of course , but but then again well , yeah . in fact , mostly not digits for the actual training the h m ms whereas uh in this case we 're just using digits for training the h m phd e : yeah . right . professor a : did anybody mention about whether the the sri system is a is is doing the digits um the wor as a word model or as uh a sub s sub - phone states ? phd e : i guess it 's it 's uh allophone models , professor a : yeah . probably . phd e : so , well yeah . i think so , because it 's their very d huge , their huge system . professor a : yeah . phd e : and . but . so . there is one difference well , the sri system the result for the sri system that are represented here are with adaptation . so there is it 's their complete system and including on - line uh unsupervised adaptation . professor a : that 's true . phd e : and if you do n't use adaptation , the error rate is around fifty percent worse , i think , if i remember . yeah . professor a : it 's tha it 's that much , huh ? phd e : nnn . it 's yeah . it 's quite significant . professor a : oh . ok . phd e : yeah . professor a : still . phd e : mm - hmm . professor a : but but uh what what i think i 'd be interested to do given that , is that we we should uh take i guess that somebody 's gon na do this , right ? is to take some of these tandem things and feed it into the sri system , right ? phd e : yeah . professor a : yeah . phd e : we can do something like that . professor a : yeah . because phd e : yeah . but but i guess the main point is the data because uh i am not sure . our back - end is is fairly simple but until now , well , the attempts to improve it or have fail ah , well , i mean uh what chuck tried to to to do professor a : yeah , but he 's doing it with the same data , right ? i mean so to so there 's there 's there 's two things being affected . phd e : yeah . so it 's yeah . professor a : i mean . one is that that , you know , there 's something simple that 's wrong with the back - end . we 've been playing a number of states phd e : mm - hmm . professor a : uh i i do n't know if he got to the point of playing with the uh number of gaussians yet phd e : mm - hmm . professor a : but but uh , uh , you know . but , yeah , so far he had n't gotten any big improvement , phd e : mm - hmm . professor a : but that 's all with the same amount of data which is pretty small . phd e : yeah . professor a : and um . phd e : mmm . so , yeah , we could retrain some of these tandem on on huge professor a : well , you could do that , but i 'm saying even with it not with that part not retrained , just just using having the h m ms much better h m phd e : ah , yeah . just f for the hmm models ."
