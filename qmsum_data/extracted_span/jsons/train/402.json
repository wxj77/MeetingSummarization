    "answer": "grad c : mm - hmm . professor f : so , you you do n't w especially in something with repetitive computation where you 're going over it multiple times , you do do n't want to have the the data that you 're working on distant from where it 's being where the computation 's being done if you can help it . grad c : mm - hmm . professor f : uh . now , we are getting more disk for the central file server , which , since it 's not a computational server , would seem to be a contradiction to what i just said . but the idea is that , uh , suppose you 're working with , uh , this big bunch of multi multilingual databases . um , you put them all in the central ser at the cen central file server . grad c : mm - hmm . professor f : then , when you 're working with something and accessing it many times , you copy the piece of it that you 're working with over to some place that 's close to where the computation is and then do all the work there . and then that way you you wo n't have the the network you wo n't be clogging the network for yourself and others . that 's the idea . so , uh , it 's gon na take us it may be too late for this , uh , p precise crunch we 're in now , but , uh , we 're , uh it 's gon na take us a couple weeks at least to get the , uh , uh , the amount of disk we 're gon na be getting . we 're actually gon na get , uh , i think four more , uh , thirty - six gigabyte drives and , uh , put them on another another disk rack . we ran out of space on the disk rack that we had , so we 're getting another disk rack and four more drives to share between , uh primarily between this project and the meetings meetings project . um . but , uh , we 've put another i guess there 's another eighteen gigabytes that 's that 's in there now to help us with the immediate crunch . but , uh , are you saying so i do n't know where you 're stephane , where you 're doing your computations . if i so , you 're on an nt machine , so you 're using some external machine phd g : yeah , it , uh well , to it 's nutmeg and mustard , i think , professor f : do you know these yet ? phd g : i do n't know what kind . phd a : nuh - uh . professor f : yeah , ok . uh , are these are these , uh , computational servers , or something ? i 'm i 've been kind of out of it . phd g : yeah , i think , yeah . i think so . professor f : unfortunately , these days my idea of running comput of computa doing computation is running a spread sheet . uh , have n't been have n't been doing much computing personally , so . um . yeah , so those are computational servers . so i guess the other question is what disk there i space there is there on the computational servers . phd a : right . yeah , i 'm not sure what 's available on is it you said nutmeg and what was the other one ? phd g : mustard . phd a : mustard . ok . professor f : yeah , well , you 're the you 're the disk czar now ."
