    "query": "<s> what 's their attitude towards the question whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees ?",
    "answer": "helen mary jones am : that 's really helpful . and on this specifically\u2014last question from me\u2014 have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees , should the academic year not be completed ? huw morris : so , as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online , clearly , there are lessons that will need to be taken on board . there are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs . the intention in all of these institutions is that they will complete their course of study . there are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed . failing those institutional mechanisms , there is a uk-wide system through the office of the independent adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have . so , we 're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs . lynne neagle am : okay . suzy , you had a supplementary . suzy davies am : no , mr morris has answered my question ."
