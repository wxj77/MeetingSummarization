    "answer": "user interface : okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh marketing : industrial designer : yeah . whatever . project manager : yeah . uh marketing : yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it . user interface : yeah . project manager : 'kay . um for those that did n't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for tv . uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , but i do n't think it 's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well . and uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . and we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let 's see what was it , uh the target group . we have to make be clear what that is . marketing : group of users , or project manager : yeah users . marketing : because it says below forty i mean . project manager : yeah so i think it 's easy but marketing : i guess that 's that 's the tar yeah uh or male and female user interface : but uh it 's it 's also for children or just uh project manager : yeah it 's below forty so we can decide where to marketing : uh six the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . user interface : okay . okay . marketing : sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . project manager : okay . so below forty is okay . marketing : so um project manager : but we need an lower level which to s uh focus . marketing : how do you mean ? project manager : so is it from sixteen to forty ? is it from twenty to forty ? is it from thirty ? marketing : uh sixteen to forty . project manager : yeah ? 'kay . user interface : yeah . we we have to marketing : well i i guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology . project manager : yeah . marketing : so they they adapt to it pretty soon i guess . user interface : and if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah so what we might wan na do is uh yeah cust i have customised the screen functions , if you know what i mean . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : the uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . but maybe elderly people do n't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . project manager : design . mm . industrial designer : and yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . user interface : yeah that 's that 's why uh i wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . the the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . and maybe y industrial designer : experienced yeah . marketing : but uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ? user interface : na i w i should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . project manager : yeah . marketing : like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ? project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . so is you should have a menu for all the the functions you do n't use regular and which are marketing : uh you can make a if you make a drawing . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . aye yeah . marketing : uh uh . project manager : shall i uh marketing : uh black 's okay . and draw it very big . project manager : yeah . it 's okay . marketing : oh . yeah . project manager : no , it does n't have line control , so marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah we get the marketing : yeah well , this is basically uh it 's industrial designer : the remote ? project manager : the remote , yeah ? marketing : alright the remote ? um well usually the power button is on top i guess . project manager : basic . is on top . which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . marketing : yeah so it should fit right in into your hand . user interface : yeah . l left top or right uh top ? project manager : t i s should said right . marketing : right . right . user interface : yeah , right . industrial designer : right top . marketing : i most people are right-handed so user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah definitely . marketing : maybe left-handed special addition , but okay . user interface : marketing : if you put it like like here . or something . i dunno . um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top i guess . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah . project manager : do the also with the thumb . so it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . marketing : okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . project manager : you you need to be able to hold it so user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : okay for example if you put the screen here , it 's more about the functions now than the than the layout . project manager : yeah okay that 's true . layout . that 's for the marketing : does n't work too well . it 's uh it 's bent . project manager : user interface : project manager : i ca n't help it . marketing : . user interface : you broke it . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : . project manager : man . marketing : right . project manager : yeah okay . marketing : okay you get it . uh for example if y if you put all the project manager : marketing : right . project manager : you want the normal piece of paper ? and you have a pen ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and might be easier huh ? marketing : maybe this . kind of works . project manager : yeah ? marketing : like if you have like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels , project manager : mm-hmm . uh . marketing : um and here one for for project manager : and the for flipping up and down . user interface : yeah yeah . and volume control . marketing : yeah that that usually uh like here , here , here , here . industrial designer : yeah i project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume uh project manager : and left to right . and those can also be used for the menu . industrial designer : yeah exactly . i thought but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things marketing : and you you have industrial designer : and marketing : most of the time you have one button in the middle . it says menu , industrial designer : yeah okay . project manager : for the menu . yeah . marketing : and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and then just project manager : yeah . marketing : mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action . project manager : yeah . marketing : so you scroll into it , okay . you select a function like v like uh bass . you just adjust it with these two buttons . project manager : yeah . marketing : then okay to confirm , and then uh on on each on each screen there 's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : and then finally say okay , exit . or or one button to exit it . user interface : yeah . marketing : uh in one time i dunno , that 's not really my department . user interface : and do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or marketing : that 's more your uh your department to to uh to project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , user interface : on the left uh top yeah . marketing : yeah . i mean it 's uh project manager : yeah but that depends on where you put the screen . user interface : okay . project manager : but it 's essential that there is a screen . marketing : yeah . yeah i mean the position of the screen is also more essential than i mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . project manager : yeah . and for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone . marketing : but um yeah so it should be i mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe . project manager : yeah . this would be uh industrial designer : why did we wan na put the display in the bottom ? marketing : i mean i project manager : no that 's not s sure so industrial designer : okay . marketing : that 's not sure project manager : uh we need a display . marketing : but it 's user interface : yeah may maybe because you 're industrial designer : because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display . user interface : yeah okay but only for the basic functi if you 're going to use the advanced option , you 're going to press the the menu button and then yeah . marketing : yeah i mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . industrial designer : normal for logical t project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . project manager : yeah they 're used to it . user interface : okay the yeah . that 's possible . marketing : so you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i mean if you grab it . industrial designer : on once it 's on it 's on . you do n't need the power button . marketing : but most most of the times if a if if a tv 's on standby people just press a channel to put it on . user interface : yeah , okay . okay we put it on top . marketing : so we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo user interface : yeah . marketing : like over here . r_r_ . and j and the microphone , i mean it can be very small . if you look at your mobile phones are some stripes , little little holes . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : maybe on the top or even on the side . project manager : marketing : yeah maybe on the side . i mean if the if the microphone is good . project manager : yeah but then it 's possible that you cover it with your hand so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : true . marketing : yeah okay . so on the on the top is better . project manager : i think that top is the best option . industrial designer : but if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side project manager : yeah okay . industrial designer : i dunno . should be able to work . marketing : yeah . . project manager : depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but i think that 's okay . industrial designer : never mind . can we leave this up to you ? user interface : marketing : yeah it does n't matter that much . so but um the screen is on top ? which functions did we have left ? i mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down . project manager : volume . up . channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options . marketing : screen is over there . project manager : so maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the lcd screen . user interface : yeah . if we marketing : yeah . yeah . that 's uh that 's a good one . industrial designer : yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right ? project manager : yeah so sounds ? industrial designer : like uh bass uh marketing : yeah . sound ? industrial designer : so we need kind of an equaliser . if you marketing : yeah . equaliser . so if you have sound but not too advanced . i mean most tvs use only treble and bass . user interface : yeah it it 's just a remote control so project manager : and they 're industrial designer : yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something . project manager : they 're not used often so user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . it 's uh pretty hard to write . project manager : industrial designer : ah as project manager : yeah just industrial designer : . marketing : mm . okay but you have sound ? project manager : yeah sounds . marketing : yeah just project manager : yeah . marketing : oh y you have digital uh industrial designer : . marketing : better write it down over there yeah . project manager : of course . i 'm just a secretary . marketing : so you have sound . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : coffee ? marketing : uh yeah sound and then within sound i guess treble and bass ? industrial designer : yes please . project manager : treble bass . industrial designer : the mono stereo option ? marketing : yeah . also . project manager : uh industrial designer : and there there was something else also . project manager : pitch i believe , yeah . industrial designer : and then pitch . marketing : pitch . yeah . but pitch , is n't that yeah that 's the the height of the tone . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the fr yeah the frequency of the tones , yeah . marketing : yeah okay , project manager : yeah and mono stereo . marketing : wh why would you use that ? industrial designer : yeah is n't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you 're watching . marketing : if people like talk like uh yeah . project manager : and also the tuning part ? marketing : programming part . project manager : yeah programming . so channel programming ? marketing : uh so we have sound , yeah ? channel programming . industrial designer : and yeah in the functionality of the user interface : television uh itself uh industrial designer : no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them ? as a confirmation or whatever you know ? i dunno . marketing : i think it g it gets annoying . project manager : yeah . marketing : i mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but user interface : we we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s industrial designer : under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things . user interface : yeah . but uh the the television itself has also the the options brightness and uh screen colour etcetera . so marketing : yeah . project manager : contrast yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah but people do n't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it 's very hard to project manager : mm . no . uh , so contrast , marketing : y yeah contrast and brightness ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : bright , marketing : yeah those are the most used i guess . if you look at your monitor . project manager : uh and the others were in your presentation right ? so i can just copy those ? marketing : well yeah well i guess that these were the only ones , i guess . project manager : okay . it 's easy . industrial designer : but so we have we have tv options , which is all this . marketing : yeah . i will look it up . project manager : yeah the button options and the lcd options . industrial designer : the sound , sound and image . and you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options . project manager : indeed . marketing : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so we need two menus kind of thing . project manager : yeah you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . industrial designer : uh-huh . project manager : and the lcd options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah . marketing : yeah with the chip and then i mean project manager : so you you have an additional processor and and software part . marketing : uh yeah . well yeah we have power button , whether that 's present . project manager : compared to o industrial designer : alright . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : channel volume selection present . uh numbers present . yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . screen settings , brightness and colour . project manager : l_ s yeah . colour . yeah i i call it contrast . marketing : yeah con contrast is project manager : yeah i make it c colour . marketing : yeah okay , colour and brightness . project manager : yeah . marketing : um and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? so you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your tv . and then you can um project manager : yeah and automatically um mm-hmm . marketing : uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it . project manager : yeah so i 've g channel program is autoseek ? marketing : yeah , autoseek . project manager : uh name a channel , or marketing : well most tvs automatically display the name , which they get through the cable . project manager : oh they get automatic names , okay . marketing : yeah . so you only have to choose the position on your project manager : . marketing : it only has to match the the channel frequency on your tv , with with the with the position on your tv and and so your remote . project manager : yeah . yeah but can you also say i want f uh veronica on the channel number uh five or industrial designer : help . marketing : if you already programmed it . project manager : yeah . marketing : if you want to move it . yeah that should be possible too . project manager : yeah . how do you call that ? marketing : yeah how do you call that ? mm ? wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . project manager : channels ? yeah . marketing : i mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever . project manager : ninety nine or something . yeah . marketing : just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed . project manager : s swap channels ? can i call it that ? marketing : yeah . swap channels . project manager : swap 's good option . okay . uh other functions ? marketing : so you most of the time if you if you swap it s uh let 's say for example you have uh r_t_l_ five on on channel five . and veronica on channel eight and you want to move veronica to channel five , most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one . project manager : mm-hmm . okay . well that 's 's up to uh mister user interface designer . user interface : marketing : yeah . it 's it 's pretty uh user interface : okay . marketing : yeah i mean you have to look on on the menu industrial designer : working design . doch . project manager : also . marketing : on the tv . project manager : that 's you 're industrial designer : he only has to figure out how it has to look . project manager : yeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ? industrial designer : and how user interface : yeah . industrial designer : to use project manager : and the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as i believe . industrial designer : yeah okay . but you did your homework . but um yeah . okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : marketing : or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ? to programme the channels ? project manager : no i do n't think so . industrial designer : no no . it should be able to do any remote . user interface : no that 's project manager : but i think the communication with the television is difficult . but that 's not our part . marketing : yeah . project manager : we do n't have to design a protocol so marketing : that 's true . that 's true . industrial designer : thank god ."
