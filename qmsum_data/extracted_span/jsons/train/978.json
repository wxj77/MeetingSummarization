    "query": "<s> summarize the conclusion of the incorporation of articulation when discussing budget balancing .",
    "answer": "user interface : mm-hmm . um yeah i mean one thing , i mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep i mean keep the um the articulation ? project manager : it 's hard to tell . um i would say that you 're at least gon na take double curved , user interface : this is what i 'm wondering . project manager : and even then i 'm not quite sure if that 's incorporating the idea of articulation . marketing : yeah . user interface : no , i think i i it d that it need n't require it to be double curved . industrial designer : it can be s yeah , it can still be single curved , user interface : it 's uh it 's just it 's just it 's just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation . industrial designer : but project manager : single curved with articulation ? industrial designer : you just . marketing : could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? 'cause like we do we have re restrictions on software ? industrial designer : that 's what we need for the joystick i think though . user interface : mm . yeah , i mean marketing : oh but there has to be user interface : and i mean the uh i mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here , the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . um i mean yeah , project manager : but the curves all o over hand , user interface : on the on the lcd i mean although we 've done it with a curve it project manager : is it ? user interface : could just as easily be done um without curves . the curve that 's really needed is up here , marketing : joystick . user interface : to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand . marketing : okay . sure . okay , my bad . project manager : we would n't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal ."
