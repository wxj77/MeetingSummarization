do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? user interface : yeah . i would do a battery we do . right ? marketing : solar cell . no project manager : we 'll wait . user interface : a battery . one battery , industrial designer : no , no solar cell , no no no no . marketing : it took a battery ? user interface : right ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : no hand dynamo . marketing : yeah . user interface : electronics , simple chip industrial designer : hand marketing : we have user interface : advanced chip , right ? marketing : no , we have sample speaker . industrial designer : on advanced chip . marketing : but b al but we also have sample speaker , do user interface : yeah , industrial designer : yeah , yeah . user interface : so this one and this one . uh we ha we have um single marketing : oh , we already on nine . user interface : what ? are we ? oh yay . marketing : we have double curved . user interface : the single . industrial designer : single nee single curved . double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . marketing : single . industrial designer : but it is n't three dimensional , user interface : oh the the industrial designer : it is n't curved in a l marketing : this one is user interface : it 's not going to work uh people . we have rubber . marketing : this one is curved like this , project manager : i 'll just fill it in . marketing : right . it 's curved like this . industrial designer : no no no , project manager : um rubber indeed ? industrial designer : single curved is like this . uh that 's the only curve you made , marketing : yeah , bu what industrial designer : not th uh curved like that . that 's uh marketing : oh , but we have curves like it and it . user interface : thirteen ?

marketing : lcd display . industrial designer : okay . okay um user interface : fifteen , oh , too bad . oh but with special colour we have . a special form , right ? industrial designer : but now button supplements . we do n't got the button supplements . user interface : oh , we do n't have any buttons , so marketing : eighteen and a half , user interface : yeah , we need to uh marketing : damn . industrial designer : damn . marketing : we have to lower it with six points . user interface : no , uh we have fifteen and industrial designer : okay . marketing : twelve and half . user interface : oh , right . industrial designer : user interface : we could lose the curve . marketing : we could use user interface : yeah , i would lose the curve . industrial designer : we could lose the scroll wheel . you could make it just a regular scroll wheel . user interface : but you ca n't push it , so you have to tap . industrial designer : yeah , if you ca n't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button . user interface : yeah , alright . project manager : yeah , i think that will be our best bet . user interface : so normal scroll wheel ? industrial designer : normal scroll wheel . user interface : and i think we should lose the curve . marketing : i think we should scrap the sample speaker . industrial designer : lose marketing : it 's four pri it four units . user interface : yeah , but if you would i it is a new feature , it it 's something special . industrial designer : okay , so we do n't exactly need the single we do n't need a curve . marketing : but w d wha user interface : no , the curve does n't really industrial designer : 's possible to lose curve . marketing : curved then it will be square . user interface : no , then it will wo n't uh stand up from the table . then it would just industrial designer : okay . marketing : was that does that mean to it , single curve ? industrial designer : yeah , that 's meant with scr uh with s curve . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : the curve is uh in a dimension . marketing : okay . industrial designer : if you make it a flat one , s n it 's no curve , you got no curves . user interface : so we would lose this one ? industrial designer : yeah , okay . marketing : yeah , but tha that that only is one . user interface : yeah , we could s yeah , a bit . industrial designer : no , two . marketing : no , one . user interface : sixteen point three . industrial designer : oh , okay , indeed . marketing : so we do n't user interface : so we still marketing : yeah , we also have to industrial designer : is it possible to make user interface : could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? marketing : no , otherwise we do n't have an lcd screen . user interface : no ? ma y you just ca n't do that , or uh project manager : and what did you change ? you changed the uh scroll wheel user interface : we changed th project manager : and user interface : yeah , and the single curved to uncurved . marketing : single curved . project manager : oh , but it 's just one marketing : flat . yeah , so that does does n't does n't that mu i think project manager : point , so maybe you should should uh marketing : scrap sample speaker ? project manager : yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition . industrial designer : the sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . marketing : that that 's uh user interface : yeah , but it 's t marketing : yes , four points . project manager : and then you can keep the curve . user interface : yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , project manager : or ca n't you ? user interface : it is something special . industrial designer : yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the marketing : yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? user interface : i do n't know . industrial designer : marketing : f you have to we have to scrap four points . user interface : yeah , that 's difficult . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : or make it on a hand dynamo , but i do n't think that will work . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? industrial designer : no , that 's no . make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ? user interface : we could make it titanium instead of rubber . industrial designer : you do n't make a remote control of ah . marketing : yeah , project manager : yeah , marketing : it it i project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah , it also uh it also takes one point less . project manager : yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , user interface : oh . oh can i ask something ? what is special colour ? marketing : yeah . user interface : is that the wood uh wood uh marketing : i think it is . user interface : this , we have to have that one too ? industrial designer : it is n't . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : what ? marketing : yeah . project manager : but it 's only a half . but i think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . marketing : yeah . sample speaker . industrial designer : to knock the sample speaker , yeah . and sample sensor . user interface : th then we still have too much marketing : yeah , okay , user interface : if we use the uh industrial designer : but m yeah , course , marketing : three . point three . industrial designer : but user interface : yeah , we we scrap that one ? industrial designer : what we 'll have . let 's make it thirteen or fourteen . user interface : see , a po marketing : point twelve . user interface : three . we need point three . marketing : that 's a scroll wheel . user interface : uh it 's a colour . do n't make it wood . industrial designer : a colour . marketing : yeah , but a wood user interface : make it uh marketing : we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . user interface : yeah , but it 's it 's special colour , is it a all kind of colours ? industrial designer : yeah , special colours , fruity colours . user interface : it 's also green or uh marketing : is it also industrial designer : yeah . marketing : no that that 's just normal colour fruit colours . user interface : yeah , but it 's a special colour than just rubber colour . marketing : normal colours , yellow user interface : you have to add something to the rubber to make it green . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : you do n't say here 's green rubber . industrial designer : they do n't sell green rubber plants . marketing : yeah , but then i d i do n't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . industrial designer : alright . user interface : yeah , you can , you should you have to lose marketing : but then we have to scrap lcd display , we have to scrap uh user interface : no , it is the scroll wheel , i guess . industrial designer : no no no . marketing : s advanced chip . no then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gon na make ? industrial designer : if we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen marketing : five ? then we have two . user interface : a push , yeah . marketing : touch . industrial designer : then it 's possible to make . and then you can and then you can add to the colours . marketing : then we can make add two colours on it . yeah , two colours it . industrial designer : special c user interface : switch colours . industrial designer : okay , if you lose uh if you lose the user interface : it was such a great idea . industrial designer : you lose this one , you got eleven point five marketing : they can add two colours . industrial designer : and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example . marketing : but the colours . um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or industrial designer : how d uh uh how many colours ? user interface : what do you mean ? industrial designer : special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p marketing : yeah , but we we we are we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . industrial designer : yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it 's a special colour . marketing : ah okay . user interface : but i think when you use the colour that 's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , industrial designer : i suppose . user interface : 'cause you have to add it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . user interface : yeah , so you always lose the special colour . you co you could make it always black , like normal remote . marketing : yeah b yeah , but we 're gon na make it yellow uh red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . industrial designer : nee we we also want to make ano another colour . user interface : oh right , yeah . yeah , we should u marketing : yeah , but m user interface : yeah . we have to make this like four or five or something . marketing : yeah , user interface : that 's what it means . marketing : because we have more colours than only black . project manager : yeah , but is n't it per remote that you pay ? user interface : yeah . marketing : i then i think i p i don i do n't think they me mean they 're special project manager : half ? user interface : oh right , yeah . is it per remote ? project manager : i think you pay half per remote . user interface : yeah . yeah , that 's right , project manager : so each remote with a special colour . user interface : and you one colour per remote . industrial designer : yeah , indeed , yeah . user interface : so then it is one . industrial designer : you do n't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote . marketing : yeah , okay okay , true . true , true . project manager : i hope . marketing : we have two points spare . project manager : so the battery , marketing : nee one point . project manager : we have um advanced chip on print . user interface : one . so it would be curved , single curve . industrial designer : project manager : because of thing user interface : or not ? project manager : yeah , well you can at least make it curved again . user interface : so y you just ca n't make a nice remote . industrial designer : yeah , single curve . project manager : because that was very important , user interface : it 's too bad for the speaker . project manager : huh ? so it 's curved , it 's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . user interface : should we change that tha that that 's a one if not , marketing : mm yep . project manager : we dropped the scroll wheel . user interface : or not ? could you copy it ? project manager : and the rest is the same , user interface : and make it uh project manager : huh ? am i right ? marketing : y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . user interface : the entire uh industrial designer : uh . huh . user interface : perhaps you can then copy page or so . ooh . no . oh you you made the entire could you industrial designer : okay . undo , undo . user interface : oh industrial designer : undo . user interface : not well . industrial designer : so , 'kay . user interface : would you ?
