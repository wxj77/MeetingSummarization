    "answer": "project manager : is everyone ready to start ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yes . project manager : okay . great . well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . i 'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running . okay . um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we 'll have your three presentations on what you 've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . and , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we 're gon na make it , what uh materials we 're gon na use , and that sort of thing . industrial designer : project manager : the meeting will be forty minutes long . industrial designer : okay . project manager : and um we will once again have poppy as our first presenter . industrial designer : okay . project manager : alright , and i will switch up powerpoint . industrial designer : thank you . project manager : okay . industrial designer : should be just loading . okay . oh , although i ca n't see it on my screen . that says go here . okay . i 've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what 's available to us f to actually make the remote control . um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . marketing : industrial designer : which is not necessarily a battery , as we 're about to see . um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we 'll be getting them from , what they 'll be made of . um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . which is where all the main information is uh contained . um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . um , and all their positioning in the circuit . project manager : um are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ? industrial designer : uh , these , they 're all different options , they 're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : we can go into that later . um , all the other things are individual components that we 'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . and the l_e_d_ of course , that 's a light emitting diode . so , we could , so we 've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well . okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . we could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . and they 're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . there 's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . a bit out of date . kinetic energy is something that 's been recently developed . project manager : um what is a hand-powered dynamo ? industrial designer : um , where you manually charge up the power . project manager : just every , every once in a while ? industrial designer : like you wind up something . project manager : just every once in a while or constantly ? industrial designer : sorry ? yeah . every once in a while i think project manager : alright . it 'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it i think . industrial designer : . but it 's yeah . it would be like going a step back in time . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i do n't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . project manager : no . marketing : industrial designer : whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that 's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . i mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . um , or there 's solar power , which we 've been considering inside a building , which is where it 's gon na be used , might not be quite so useful . project manager : right . industrial designer : but , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . that 's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . like how it 's comfortable and s sits in the hand . we do n't want something that 's huge and you ca n't pick up . or too small . or too slidy . i know i 've had a remote control before which you could n't tell which was the front and the back , user interface : industrial designer : 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that i 'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . because you ca n't really see which way round it is . project manager : right . industrial designer : um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-r_s_i_ . it 's like the same sort of rubber that 's used in stress balls and things like that , so it 's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : wood . project manager : industrial designer : um , again , stepping back in time again there . user interface : industrial designer : i do n't think that 's quite up to date with what we 're looking for here . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : um , titanium is not gon na be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . but , would 've been maybe for future projects . um right our choice for buttons as well . we 've developed some we 've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . i think that was brought up for , um , they 're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you do n't have to use individual buttons . you can just slide up and down . i 'm sure we 're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . project manager : um one thing with the scroll buttons though . it , it industrial designer : project manager : we would have to have an lcd um industrial designer : yeah . that 's true . project manager : display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult . industrial designer : and that would lead to an advanced yeah . if we have yeah . we 're going on to that later with the advanc with the lcd that means we 'd need a really advanced chip . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and it 's unlikely that that 's gon na be in our budget . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um , also we 've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we 're most familiar with . it 's the most straightforward . but you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . . got decisions to make there . and this is what i was just saying before . linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . um simple would go with the pushbutton . um , regular you could link with the scroll button . and the advanced we 'd have to go with a lcd s display . project manager : right . industrial designer : my personal preferences ? i think we could go for the kinetic energy source . i do n't , i think that 's quite um an advanced kind of technology . it 's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . and also energy saving 'cause you 're producing the energy , you do n't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . you just give it a shake . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : sounds brilliant to me . rubber casing i thing would probably the best , if we 're going for the anti-r_s_i_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . like it could be pretty much any colour we want . um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . and probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , marketing : industrial designer : then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no lcd , 'cause we probably ca n't afford that one . project manager : yeah . um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : like as the exterior . this is the one thing that 's protecting its innards . industrial designer : i think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . and the rubber would just be the , what 's in contact with the human . project manager : yeah . another thing is it might be more difficult if it 's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um , is it industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i do n't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . it would work that way . industrial designer : maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . so , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . user interface : like plastic with rubber , kind of on top industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : like i ca n't think of what . user interface : well , there 's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . or like an user interface : b like a nokia it is . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : you can get sort of outer casing for ipods and something , that 's just it 's protective as well . user interface : it 's yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : like the skin ? industrial designer : it , it stops it , i mean , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it would n't damage itself so easily . project manager : yeah . user interface : project manager : alright . so maybe the industrial designer : i think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . industrial designer : and then yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah . marketing : and the buttons obviously are rubber . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah . marketing : project manager : that sounds good . i , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ? industrial designer : as far as i know . it should be . project manager : okay , marketing : project manager : we 'll just say yeah . user interface : project manager : yes , just why not . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : alright . i like the kinetic energy source idea . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um , i do n't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . industrial designer : i thought that was project manager : but i think that it 's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um user interface : yeah , tha marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : energy source . it could make an we could have any kind of style . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it would n't be as heavy or bulky , and industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . just for environmental reasons . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : marketing : i guess it 's a bit scary 'cause it has n't been done before . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so it seems we 'd have to do more research on it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : or i dunno if you could have a battery pack . industrial designer : like as a backup for something . user interface : backup . yeah . marketing : yeah so there 's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries i believe . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : so , if it was running off of one battery as a user interface : that would be good yeah . industrial designer : yeah . some alternative just in case something went wrong . marketing : right . user interface : maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . industrial designer : that 's true . i just thought of that . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : so maybe that could be incorporated as industrial designer : may maybe that could be the backup . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : instead of a battery . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : like solar backup . marketing : although it needs some light , does n't it ? industrial designer : yeah . i suppose project manager : yeah , you can watch a tv in the dark then . user interface : do , do those calculators industrial designer : s but some marketing : so , if we 're doing user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . if we 're industrial designer : but thing is , it 's not you do n't need the solar all the time . user interface : i do n't know how it works . industrial designer : it can be stored . it can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : like a few hours a day . . project manager : i think that might be a little impractical though . marketing : yeah . i think sometimes it 's just shoved under , under a cushion , project manager : yeah . marketing : and yeah . industrial designer : that 's true . it could easily user interface : yeah . project manager : like people do n't wan na have to worry about that . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , i forgot to charge my remote today . user interface : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : like if the kinetic thing , i think what 's best about that is that it 's instant energy . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : you do n't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and it works . project manager : or just like pick it up when you 're gon na use it . industrial designer : yeah . instead of you do n't have to like make sure it 's in the right place to charge and . user interface : yeah , i suppose . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : alright . cool . industrial designer : k okay . project manager : 's that the end of your presentation . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : alright . user interface : yeah . project manager : thank you . industrial designer : there we go . user interface : thanks . oh . it 's not on my screen . industrial designer : it was n't on mine either . user interface : why ? industrial designer : i do n't know why . i think , i just , i just used the mouse on there . user interface : you do n't know why ? oh okay . is it that one ? project manager : yeah . that 's um industrial designer : yeah . user interface : um , i 'm just gon na go through the interface concept with yous now . uh , first of all i 'll explain what a user interface is . it 's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user . and it 's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . um , there are two types of user interfaces . there 's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . so that 's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about . project manager : oh . okay . yeah . user interface : yeah . i 'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that 's on an lcd screen . or maybe it 's the the buttons or pictures or something . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : do you think it 's project manager : yeah , 'cause industrial designer : so i suppose sometime project manager : i 'm sorry ? industrial designer : after you . user interface : project manager : um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . you 're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want . user interface : yeah . yeah . so you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . industrial designer : i s i suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol . user interface : like an lcd screen . industrial designer : and if you wanted to go onto teletext or , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i know we 're not having that , but i mean a similar thing , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you , they have there 's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which i suppose it 's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : but if we 're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably wo n't have to focus so much on that . project manager : yeah , we 'll be doing industrial designer : it 'll be more the on the numbers and the volume . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . it 'd be more a command interface , and then industrial designer : i suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : so it 's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ? industrial designer : i marketing : the infrared is like , that 's considered a user interface : no i think it 's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that 's on the buttons of the remote control , and per marketing : okay . so when it says pointing device that does n't include industrial designer : for inp user interface : well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen . project manager : yeah . i think they 're talking about lcd type things . marketing : okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah . user interface : but um i think we 're gon na go with the command interface anyway , project manager : yeah . user interface : to make it more simplistic . but the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe . project manager : what do you mean ? user interface : like i ca n't think of an example , but sort of like little pictures rather than project manager : oh yeah , like how the buttons user interface : like a little sound . instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something . project manager : yeah , as a button though . user interface : yeah , something y project manager : so , it 's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ? user interface : yeah m perha yeah . yeah . maybe . project manager : okay . yeah . i like that idea . user interface : um , the co uh we 've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . as it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly . um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we 'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . you know , make it more trendy and original . we 'll have more money if we keep it simple . project manager : yeah . i 'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget . a bit more too , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . seeing as it 's quite a new technology . um we , we also have to keep in mind when we 're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms are n't always helpful . industrial designer : yeah . that 's true . that 's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : it can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming . user interface : yeah . and that all interfaces are different . so , um , that does n't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that 's easy to understand . and maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : does anyone have any questions ? project manager : do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look . marketing : i think if we go with the um design plate thing , we 'll have to . just because of colour clashing , project manager : yeah . marketing : and if we wanted to , project manager : yeah . marketing : so and , and we might , i mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons . user interface : but um project manager : but what about the lighting up effect ? marketing : you mean different colours for the lighting or project manager : um , well , um , i thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they 'd all light up . and so if they were black , it would n't be possible for them to light up . marketing : mm-hmm . oh i see what you 're saying . project manager : if they were white they would glow , probably . marketing : well y project manager : if they were made out of rubber . marketing : oh so you 're picturing the light is coming from the back . i kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards . but , but i guess , you mean from the back . project manager : where would the light come from ? marketing : okay . industrial designer : i 'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something . project manager : yeah , marketing : right . project manager : and well rubber is a more translucent product too , industrial designer : yeah , yeah . project manager : so we have that taken care of . industrial designer : it should be able to marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : in the phone that i was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . industrial designer : li yeah . user interface : so you can change the buttons when you 're changing the faces . do you know what i mean ? marketing : oh . user interface : 'cause it 's just the wee control , marketing : yeah . they , they insert over . user interface : yeah , thing that 's behind it . marketing : okay . user interface : so i mean , we do n't have to decide on one colour . each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : well , if they 're raised up buttons . so that you can feel them . user interface : yeah . project manager : we were talking about it being more um , a lot more tangible . um , it might be more difficult to do . if they 're , if they 're sticking up . user interface : yeah . project manager : if it 's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it 's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i think it would be possible . i do n't think it would make that much difference . i mean , the uh the dimensions of it . 'cause if it 's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . you can like take off the hard cover and then there 's the like say the buttons . and then you get to the circuit . i do n't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . i 'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty . project manager : yeah . okay . industrial designer : i 'm sure that 'd be fine . user interface : yeah . project manager : alright . if it 's do-able we can do . user interface : project manager : yeah , sounds good to me . industrial designer : user interface : so that 's everything , then ? industrial designer : okay . project manager : alright , thank you . marketing : okay is that my turn then ? project manager : that means you 're up . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : alright . i have a shorter report for you today . um , it took a while to get this , uh uh . industrial designer : you 're not plugged in yet . marketing : oh . user interface : marketing : that 's a very good point . project manager : user interface : marketing : okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . sorry . there we go . um so , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . i also spoke with fashion experts in milan , new york and paris . and i looked at the design reports from previous years , here at real remote . um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . um , so i 'll list the three most important aspects that i 've come across . um , and they , they 're each more important than the one that comes after it . uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . um , this should be our priority , as we 've been saying . the second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . so , i think we 've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates . um , so it looks like we 'll be able to keep on track with that . and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . so , pretty basic there . and the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in paris and milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . again , we 've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . um so , my personal preferences here , um of course , as we , we 've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and i 'd like to stick to that . the fruits and vegetable themes , i do n't know if that 's going to work for us . it sounds something that you 'd use on kitchenware . i do n't know if we wan na do it on remotes . user interface : marketing : it could be one of the options . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we 're gon na stick to that . and then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness . project manager : yeah . yeah , it 's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that i find rather jarring . everything else we can really , we can really industrial designer : it is strange . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . marketing : it 's , it 's a little but it , it 's everywhere . industrial designer : well user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : so maybe we i 've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . user interface : project manager : yeah . marketing : but i i think , i think if we stick to tv based , you know , maybe tv shows , or project manager : but they still need to um fit into people 's decor though . user interface : yeah . marketing : or colour schemes . industrial designer : we i think we possibly could take a more abstract design . marketing : right . industrial designer : like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . and then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . i mean we do n't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : or a strawberry seed or a leaf . user interface : yeah , yeah . marketing : the the essence of strawberry . yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that 's fits in more with what we 're doing . instead of fruits and vegetables , user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : just if you look at it straightforward , it 's a bit yeah . it does n't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that 's the current theme . project manager : yeah . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : but may maybe we could go more directly , i do n't know . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but initially , i dunno . i think if we just sort of tone it down a bit . project manager : tone it down . yeah , industrial designer : yeah and like not , not marketing : i guess , yeah . project manager : like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : or banana-shaped . marketing : one thing i was thinking though is project manager : marketing : i dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . user interface : yeah . marketing : so maybe there could be animal-based , you know . because a lot of people have a house cat . or , or a dog . um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . but it 's something to keep in mind . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and , did you have any questions ? pretty straightforward ? project manager : yeah um industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions . so i 'll need to um hook up the powerpoint again . marketing : there you go . have you guys been saving your powerpoint presentations to the industrial designer : i did n't for the first one . but i have now . marketing : okay . project manager : but it 's still around right ? industrial designer : yeah . uh , hopefully project manager : okay . user interface : where do you have to save it to ? industrial designer : . project documents i think . user interface : okay . project manager : okay . i 'm just trying to make this pop up now . alright . here we go . okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . so energy , we industrial designer : okay . project manager : oh . oh no i ca n't write it in when it 's in this setting . industrial designer : 'kay . project manager : does anyone know how to take it out of um , user interface : just escape i think . marketing : the powerpoint ? project manager : yeah . yeah . okay . um , so back to decisions . energy , we 've decided on kinetic , right ? industrial designer : kinetic yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay , so that 's good . industrial designer : are we going to have a backup ? or do we just project manager : but would a backup really be necessary ? i mean will people just use the battery if there 's no , if there 's , industrial designer : i think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , project manager : if there is backup . industrial designer : and be bold and innovative , user interface : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and hope this works , and well hope that it works . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i think project manager : there 's like no reason why it would n't work , right ? industrial designer : yeah . i think no . i , i think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . marketing : so project manager : yeah . it could even be one of our selling points . industrial designer : go for it . it could be user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : fully kinetic energy . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : environmentally conscious or something . industrial designer : is everyone happy with that ? marketing : so if it 's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : hope so . marketing : okay . project manager : alright , the next um decision is chip on print . i do n't exactly know what that means . industrial designer : um , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . and that linked in with what buttons we would gon na have , so project manager : right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ? industrial designer : yeah , it was user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so that was without the lcd . so that means we 're not doing the advanced . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons . project manager : i think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ? industrial designer : uh , so that 's the simple . user interface : yeah . i don project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ? industrial designer : yeah possibly . project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : so , it 's probably gon na be the regular chip that we 're going to need . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so it 's a medium . project manager : that 's called medium , or regular ? industrial designer : so regular chip . regular sorry . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : regular chip . marketing : oh , is regular not simple ? industrial designer : lighting . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah if we user interface : it 's for the lighting , yeah . industrial designer : because of the lighting that we 've decided to put in as well . marketing : right right right . project manager : okay , and cases . um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it 's made of , or what ? industrial designer : so th i think this is just like gon na be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . well , i guess plastic and coated in rubber . industrial designer : rubber . user interface : yeah industrial designer : yeah . project manager : plastic with rubber industrial designer : plastic rubber coat . user interface : plastic coat . project manager : coating and interchangeable um industrial designer : interchangeable , yeah . still going for that . project manager : yeah , interchangeable plates . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . user interface concept . this is your time to shine . user interface : we decided on the component . i , i i 'm sorry , i 've lost my um powerpoint thing , so i ca n't remember what it 's ca it 's the component industrial designer : your screen ? marketing : think it was called command interface . industrial designer : was it project manager : oh , yeah . yeah . marketing : command interface , . user interface : the command inter project manager : command interface . industrial designer : ouch . user interface : the command line interface yeah . project manager : did you say command line ? okay . user interface : yeah . project manager : line interface . marketing : project manager : alright , and supplements . what 's that all about ? user interface : um , i think that is marketing : project manager : user interface : well we have n't really made any decisions about what we 're gon na do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? project manager : um user interface : you know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : we have n't really decided what to do about that . project manager : um , what are our choices here ? user interface : well it 's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons . what kind of functions wi shall we have ? project manager : you mean like we 'll have the numbers of the channels , and we 'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ? industrial designer : the power . volume . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um user interface : so pretty just just the basic button functions . project manager : yeah . like i do n't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have industrial designer : may yeah . project manager : um , yeah . industrial designer : tone , contrast , and things . that 's a bit marketing : that was on , um one of my presentations . about how often it was used . industrial designer : yeah , it was minima marketing : do you remember that ? industrial designer : well , it was n't the l project manager : yeah , it was hardly ever used really . user interface : yeah . marketing : i w should i bring it up ? project manager : yeah . and most televisions will come with a remote . industrial designer : yeah . that would be good . yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , user interface : yeah , each television . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so project manager : 'kay , well we know we want numbers . marketing : the ch t screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . so tw twice every once every two hours . um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . that 's brightness , colour , tone , all that . industrial designer : mm . i think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , user interface : you do n't change that often , yeah . industrial designer : does n't it ? i 'm sure it has its own buttons , so you do n't necessarily need to have it on remote . project manager : yeah , it does . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah , and different televisions . industrial designer : user interface : yeah . project manager : like we , i do n't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of industrial designer : yeah . project manager : changes like that . industrial designer : so we 're just going for power , channels , volume , project manager : volume . marketing : the other one was audio settings . mono , stereo , pitch . i mean i sometimes use that . some tvs will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um user interface : yeah . marketing : and that , they say that 's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . like almost once an hour . project manager : yeah . marketing : um , relevance of two . project manager : oh . we have five minutes to finish our meeting . user interface : project manager : crap . okay , um , let 's do this fast . um industrial designer : marketing : well that did n't some up on mine . project manager : should we have audio ? it only comes up on mine usually . user interface : it w it would seem silly if we 'd having anything else , just have an audio button though . project manager : yeah , user interface : do you know ? project manager : i do n't , i it 's , it 's a problem with the international uh appeal , i think . um , if we have audio because we do n't know how other televisions work . but we know that everyone has this and it 's the same . user interface : but we industrial designer : i 've marketing : yeah i guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , mm it is a good sales ploy to say , are n't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . user interface : yeah . marketing : this one has channel , volume and your channe and your power . industrial designer : yeah , that 's it . we can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . user interface : that could be a sales pitch . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : simple and project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah uh i marketing : okay . project manager : alright . industrial designer : brilliant . user interface : yeah . project manager : good . and , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . we 'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . um , you 'll be working , poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . wait a minute . is that right ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . and you 'll be evaluating the product . um , poppy and tara will have to work together , using modelling clay . user interface : project manager : and , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . industrial designer : okay . project manager : alright . so , anyone else have something to say ? industrial designer : um , i just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , i thi i think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that 's what the surveys brought out , i think that we should probably go along with that . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : um , so i suppose that 'll come out in our dev design development . but you 're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ? marketing : now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gon na come up with casing ideas ? industrial designer : y yeah . marketing : like f five different user interface : yeah . project manager : five . . user interface : what i what i was thinking what do yous think of this ? um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : like grapes . like that 's kind of fruity or something . marketing : yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it 's true . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : that 's just industrial designer : we can have a look at those ideas , yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : project manager : yeah . marketing : i guess what you i ideally you 'd kind of think of age markets as well . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so it 's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . something that your granny would want on her remote control . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um , and international tastes as well , so project manager : yeah . industrial designer : tricky . a lot of things to consider . hm . user interface : marketing : not easy . project manager : yeah . lots of user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . alright . industrial designer : okay . project manager : 'kay we 'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then . user interface : project manager : alright . and , um , we 'll reconvene in thirty minutes . marketing : project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : okay . industrial designer : thank you . user interface : marketing :"
