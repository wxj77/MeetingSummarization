    "query": "<s> what did the group talk about the progress in numeracy skills ?",
    "answer": "dawn bowden am : sure , okay . can i just move you on , then , to numeracy and whether you can tell us if you 're satisfied with the progress in numeracy , because i think we were doing better on the pisa results in maths in wales than we did previously ? so , what are your thoughts on that ? meilyr rowlands : i think there is a fairly clear good news story here . pisa shows improvements and a lot of that can be attributed , i think , to the new gcse mathematics numeracy . i think there 's much less predictability in that work ; you ca n't approach it in a formulaic way , either the pupils or the teachers in terms of teaching it . there 's much more problem solving . it 's about applying what you 've learnt in the core mathematics lessons to new situations in subjects across the curriculum . i think that that gcse numeracy has built on the work that 's been done lower down on the national numeracy framework , which has the same philosophy of applying that mathematics knowledge in a problem-solving situation . that has been a really good news story , really . dawn bowden am : that 's something to be positive about , anyway . that 's good . my final question , chair , is : in your view , to what extent is wales on track to meet the target of 500 points in each of the domains in the 2020-1 cycle for pisa ?"
