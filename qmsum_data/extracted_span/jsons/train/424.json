    "answer": "grad d : and i think there are about ten different gouping patterns professor f : let 's try it . phd g : well let 's give it a try . grad d : is n't that right , liz ? that we did . phd g : righ - right , and you just they 're randomly generated and randomly assigned to digits . postdoc e : i did mm - hmm . professor f : so we have postdoc e : go ahead . professor f : sorry , i i was just gon na say , so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of of recordings now . and you 're saying two hours , uh , is digits , so that 's roughly the ratio then , something like twenty twenty to one . which i guess makes makes sense . so if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this . grad d : right . professor f : um , yeah like you say , i think a couple hours for a for a for a test test set 's ok . it 'd be nice to get , you know , more later because we 'll we might use use this up , uh , in some sense , postdoc e : mm - hmm . grad d : right . professor f : but but uh postdoc e : yeah , i also would like to argue for that cuz it it seems to me that , um , there 's a real strength in having the same test replicated in a whole bunch of times and adding to that basic test bank . grad d : right . postdoc e : hmm ? cuz then you have , you know , more and more , u chances to get away from random errors . and i think , um , the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups , and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having uh f for replicating all of the digits that we 've done , which were done by non - native speakers so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set , which is totally american speakers , and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database . grad d : right . i think that uh trying to duplicate , spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing ti - digits probably is n't too worthwhile because the recording situation is so different . professor f : yeah . grad d : it 's gon na be very hard to be comparable . postdoc e : except that if you have the stimuli comparable , then it says something about the the contribution of setting professor f : no it 's it 's not the same . postdoc e : and professor f : a little bit , but the other differences are so major . grad d : yeah i mean read versus not . professor f : they 're such major sources of variance that it 's it 's it 's uh postdoc e : what 's an example of a of m some of the other differences ? any other a difference ? professor f : well i i individual human glottis is going to be different for each one , you know , it 's just there 's so many things . grad d : well , and not just that , professor f : it 's it and and enunciation . grad d : i mean the uh the corpus itself . i mean , we 're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list , and i 'm sure that they 're doing more specific stuff . i mean if i remember correctly it was like postman reading zipcodes and things like that . professor f : ti - digits was ? grad d : i thought so . professor f : i thought i thought it was read . grad d : was it read ? professor f : yeah , i think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be ogi . grad d : oh , i may well be . professor f : yeah , no ti - digits was read in th in read in the studio i believe ."
