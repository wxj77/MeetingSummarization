    "answer": "phd d : yeah . um it was something similar to n on - line normalization finally i mean , in the idea of of normalizing professor b : yeah . but it 's a little more it it 's a little finer , right ? so they had like ten quantiles phd d : yeah . professor b : and and they adjust the distribution . phd d : right . professor b : so you you have the distributions from the training set , and then , uh so this is just a a histogram of of the amplitudes , i guess . right ? and then um , people do this in image processing some . phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : you have this kind of of histogram of of levels of brightness or whatever . and and and then , when you get a new new thing that you you want to adjust to be better in some way , you adjust it so that the histogram of the new data looks like the old data . you do this kind of piece - wise linear or , uh , some kind of piece - wise approximation . they did a uh one version that was piece - wise linear and another that had a power law thing between them between the points . and , uh , they said they s they sort of see it in a way as s for the speech case { comment } as being kind of a generalization of spectral subtraction in a way , because , you know , in spectral subtraction you 're trying to get rid of this excess energy . uh , you know , it 's not supposed to be there . uh and , uh , this is sort of adjusting it for for a lot of different levels . and then they have s they have some kind of , uh , a floor or something , so if it gets too low you do n't do n't do it . and they they claimed very nice results , phd d : mm - hmm . phd a : so is this a histogram across different frequency bins ? professor b : and phd a : or ? professor b : um , i think this i you know , i do n't remember that . do you remember ? phd d : i think they have , yeah , different histograms . i uh something like one per frequency band , professor b : one phd a : so , one histogram per frequency bin . professor b : one per critical phd d : or but i did yeah , i guess . phd a : and that 's"
