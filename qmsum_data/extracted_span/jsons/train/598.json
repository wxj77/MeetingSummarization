    "answer": "professor b : um , i i really would like to suggest looking , um , a little bit at the kinds of errors . i know you can get lost in that and go forever and not see too much , but sometimes , phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : but but , um , just seeing that each of these things did n't make things better may not be enough . it may be that they 're making them better in some ways and worse in others , phd c : yeah . mm - hmm . professor b : or increasing insertions and decreasing deletions , or or , um , um , you know , helping with noisy case but hurting in quiet case . and if you saw that then maybe you it would something would occur to you of how to deal with that . phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . alright . mmm . yeah . w um , so that 's it , i think , for the on - line normalization . um yeah . i 've been playing a little bit with some kind of thresholding , and , mmm , as a first experiment , i think i yeah . well , what i did is t is to take , um to measure the average no , the maximum energy of s each utterance and then put a threshold well , this for each mel band . then put a threshold that 's fifteen db below well , uh , a couple of db below this maximum , professor b : mm - hmm . mmm . phd c : and actually it was not a threshold , it was just adding noise . professor b : mm - hmm . phd c : so i was adding a white noise energy , uh , that 's fifteen db below the maximum energy of the utterance . and yeah . when we look at at the , um , mfcc that result from this , they are a lot more smoother . um , when we compare , like , a channel zero and channel one utterance um , so a clean and , uh , the same noisy utterance well , there is almost no difference between the cepstral coefficients of the two . um . and yeah . and the result that we have in term of speech recognition , actually it 's not it 's not worse , it 's not better neither , but it 's , um , kind of surprising that it 's not worse because basically you add noise that 's fifteen db just fifteen db below the maximum energy . grad a : sorry . phd c : and at least phd f : so why does that m smooth things out ? i do n't i do n't understand that . professor b : well , there 's less difference . right ? phd c : it 's i think , it 's whitening this the portion that are more silent , professor b : cuz it 's phd c : as you add a white noise that are has a very high energy , it whitens everything phd f : huh . oh , ok . phd c : and and the high - energy portion of the speech do n't get much affected anyway by the other noise . and as the noise you add is the same is the shape , it 's also the same . professor b : yeah . phd c : so they have the trajectory are very , very similar . and and professor b : so , i mean , again , if you trained in one kind of noise and tested in the same kind of noise , you 'd you know , given enough training data you do n't do b do badly . the reason that we d that we have the problems we have is because it 's different in training and test . even if the general kind is the same , the exact instances are different . and and phd f : mm - hmm . professor b : so when you whiten it , then it 's like you the the only noise to to first order , the only th noise that you have is white noise and you 've added the same thing to training and test . phd f : mm - hmm . professor b : so it 's , uh phd f : so would that be similar to , like , doing the smoothing , then , over time or ? phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : well , it 's a kind of smoothing , phd c : i think it 's i think it 's different . professor b : but phd c : it 's it 's something that yeah , that affects more or less the silence portions because phd f : mm - hmm . phd c : well , anyway , the sp the portion of speech that ha have high energy are not ch a lot affected by the noises in the aurora database . professor b : mm - hmm . phd c : if if you compare th the two shut channels of speechdat - car during speech portion , it 's n n n the mfcc are not very different . they are very different when energy 's lower , like during fricatives or during speech pauses . and , professor b : yeah , but you 're still getting more recognition errors , phd c : uh"
