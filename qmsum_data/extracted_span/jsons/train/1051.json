    "answer": "marketing : do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ? user interface : uh , i do n't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . so they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home . marketing : okay . project manager : so can we use any any frequency ? industrial designer : yeah , it should be okay . project manager : we have the right to use any frequency ? user interface : uh no but as i know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . we can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we do n't need to ask any permission . project manager : okay . and what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? and so do they have the same frequency , or ? user interface : uh for this i 'm not uh i i do n't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your tv can understand it project manager : okay . a kind of identification , user interface : yeah , identification code inside the industrial designer : yeah f uh i know about this , since it 's my it 's exactly my field , so . project manager : okay . so industrial designer : it 's uh kind of handshaking , uh , when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your tv then then it 's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . project manager : yeah . so industrial designer : so so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the tv set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay . project manager : okay . user interface : the password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem . a specific uh remote control has a specific f industrial designer : yeah but we we do n't have to think uh about this because i think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy . it 's worth to buy . and they have these problems solved so . so we do n't have to think about these ."
