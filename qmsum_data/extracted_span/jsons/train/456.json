    "query": "<s> what is the role of schools with pdg for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia in this field ?",
    "answer": "mark reckless am : i think my questions are first , but , michelle , please do correct me if you were planning to come in before . the pdg for looked-after children does n't quite seem to have the degree of visibility as the pdg for the free-school-meals . i think we had the mori/wiserd survey\u2014only 15 per cent of primary schools and 23 per cent of secondary schools were aware that pdg was targeted at looked-after children . i just wonder\u2014can you clarify on the record here what is the role of schools with pdg for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia in this field ? kirsty williams am : okay . i think it is absolutely fair to say that most awareness around pdg is around free school meals . there is less awareness around the availability of pdg to support looked-after children . i think that 's probably in the nature of the cohort , so , there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after . so , i think that 's part of the explanation . a decision was taken in 2015 to regionalise pdg for looked-after children . my understanding was that the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it was being used previously . so , looked-after pdg is held at a regional level . we have looked-after children pdg co-ordinators\u2014they 're in their second year this year\u2014to look at a regional deployment of that resource . and that resource can be done in a variety of ways , through individual allocation to a school to support an individual child , through to capacity building for the whole system . so , for instance , if i give you an example , in carmarthenshire , there 's been a big emphasis on attachment disorder and training teachers with regard to the impact of attachment disorder . carmarthenshire happens to be one of those local authorities that does quite well in terms of attainment for looked-after children . but , clearly , i have\u2014not concerns . 'concerns ' is n't the right word . but i have asked officials to give greater scrutiny to how that resource has been used in the last year . steve , on my behalf , wrote out to the system , setting out our expectations , but also advising them of the fact we will be asking very detailed questions of accountability for that money . so , what has that money been used on and how can you account for the effect ? but , steve , maybe you can give some greater detail ."
