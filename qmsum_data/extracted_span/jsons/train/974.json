    "answer": "grad f : yeah , i is cheap . i mean , if we need to we can buy a disk , hang it off a s uh , workstation . if it 's not backed - up the sysadmins do n't care too much . professor d : yeah . so , i mean , pretty much anytime we need a disk , we can get it at the rate that we 're phd i : you can i should n't be saying this , but , you can just you know , since the back - ups are every night , you can recycle the backed - up diskspace . grad f : yeah . but that 's that 's that 's risky . professor d : yeah . you really should n't be saying grad f : mmm . mmm . phd i : i did n't say that . grad f : yeah , that 's right . phd i : i did n't say that . grad f : beep that out . professor d : da - we had allowed dave to listen to these these , uh , recordings . phd i : right . professor d : um yeah , i me and there 's been this conversation going on about getting another file server , and and we can do that . phd i : mm - hmm . professor d : we 'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of of disk , i guess . grad f : yeah . it 's really the back - up issue rather than the file server issue . phd i : well , i think { comment } i think there 's an argument for having you know , you could use our old file server for for disks that have data that is very rarely accessed , and then have a fast new file server for data that is , um , heavily accessed . grad f : yeah . my understanding is , the issue is n't really the file server . phd i : yeah . grad f : we could always put more disks on . phd i : yeah . it 's the back it 's the back - up capaci grad f : it 's the back - up system . phd i : yeah . grad f : so which is near saturation , apparently . so . phd b : i think i think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines . professor d : soon . phd b : and we 've got , you know , fifty machines trying to access data off of abbott at once . grad f : well , we 're alright for now because the network 's so slow . phd i : i mean , i think i think we 've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it , but the what about putting the stuff on , like , c - cd - rom or dvd or something ? grad f : yeah . that was me . i was the one who said it was not reliable . the - they they wear out . phd i : ok . oh , ok . grad f : yeah . the the th phd i : but they wear out just from sitting on the shelf ? grad f : yep . absolutely . phd i : or from being read and read ? grad f : no . read and write do n't hurt them too much unless you scratch them . phd i : oh , ok . grad f : but the r the write once , and the read - writes , do n't last . so you do n't wa you do n't wan na put ir un reproduceable data on them . phd i : uh - huh . phd b : wear out after what amount of time ? grad f : year or two . postdoc a : would it be ? professor d : year or two ? phd i : but if that then you would think you 'd hear much more clamoring about data loss professor d : and we can take care of that by putting it on non - back up drives and just backing it up once onto this tape . phd i : mm - hmm . grad f : i think that 's a good idea . phd i : right . professor d : oh . yeah . good . it 's good . phd g : so , who 's gon na do these back - ups ? the people that collect it ? grad f : uh well , i 'll talk to dave , and and see what th how what the best way of doing that is . phd b : it 's probably gon na n grad f : there 's a little utility that will manually burn a tape for you , and that 's probably the right way to do it . phd b : yeah , and we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meetings . phd g : well , s yeah . that 's what i 'm wondering , if grad f : well we 're g we 're gon na automate that . my intention is to do a script that 'll do everything . phd g : i mean , you do n't have to physically put a tape in the drive ? grad f : no . it 's all tape robot , phd g : or s ? s ? { comment } oh , ok . grad f : so you just sit down at your computer and you type a command . phd g : so it 's just oh , ok . phd i : yeah , but then you 're effectively using the resources of the back - up system . or is that a different tape robot ? grad f : yeah . phd g : but not at the same time . grad f : but y but you would be anyway . phd b : no , no , no . grad f : right ? phd b : he 's saying get a whole different drive . grad f : because phd i : no , no . see grad f : but there 's no reason to do that . phd i : yeah , just give a dedi grad f : it we already have it there and it it 's phd i : well , i 'm saying is @ @ i if you go to dave , and and and ask him `` can i use your tape robot ? `` , he will say , `` well that 's gon na screw up our back - up operation . `` grad f : no , we wo n't . he 'll say `` if if that means that it 's not gon na be backed - up standardly , great . `` professor d : he - i dave has has promoted this in the past . so i do n't think he 's actually against it . grad f : yeah . it 's it 's definitely no problem . phd i : oh , ok . alright . professor d : yeah . phd i : alright . good . phd g : what about if the times overlap with the normal back - up time ? grad f : um , it 's it 's just it 's just a utility which queues up . it just queues it up and and when it 's available , it will copy it . professor d : yeah . grad f : and then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can , you know , do it a a few days later or whatever you wan na do , after you confirm that it 's really backed - up . nw ? postdoc a : you saying nw archive ? grad f : nw archive . postdoc a : yep { comment } and if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back - ups . grad f : that 's what it is . right ."
