    "answer": "industrial designer : project manager : so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . user interface : okay . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : so . so let 's see the what did you prepare . user interface : yeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ? mm the shared folder . project manager : sh share folder for th your presentation ? user interface : yes . we have a presentation . project manager : because i have here industrial designer : user interface : uh so i got the participant uh three . w uh . three . it 's the final design , yeah . project manager : okay just one . industrial designer : user interface : s so so i discussed with guillaume . industrial designer : mm . yeah . user interface : right . and uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an lcd or not because it 's too expensive . so we come up with two versions . one with and one without lcds . um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module . and detachable big buttons for all people um . so . industrial designer : s okay so i 'll show you the the two prototypes . here we have the first one with the beautiful uh lcd um display . you you can s here . and you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . you can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it 's considered like a enter function . user interface : mm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : you have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . user interface : industrial designer : and here the the switch that control if you want project manager : why you why you you put it in the the side ? industrial designer : well i i i think uh it 's the project manager : it 's not a good place maybe . industrial designer : yeah but user interface : no i i it 's the all around camer uh microphone is n't it . the the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? industrial designer : well so it 's a microphone array . user interface : project manager : oh it 's very costly , microphone array . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : no user interface : yeah industrial designer : it 's just a single microphone , and you i i think uh we we put it here because i think when you when you are browsing your lcd you will be close to marketing : yeah . industrial designer : well it 's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . user interface : yeah yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : and here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . and uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . project manager : how much does it cost this one ? industrial designer : well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars user interface : for the project manager : fifteen dollars ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : fifteen dollars , project manager : ah it 's above it 's above the budget . industrial designer : but uh well it 's not it 's not uh yeah , but uh it 's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila . marketing : the cost would be le reduced . industrial designer : yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . user interface : mm . hmm . project manager : how many b battery is there ? industrial designer : how many , excuse me ? project manager : battery . industrial designer : well uh f battery , we use uh about uh user interface : is it n the two a_a_s batteries in it . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : a_a_ rechargeable batteries . industrial designer : rechargeable of course , user interface : yeah rechargeable batteries . industrial designer : because we have the charger . user interface : we have the charger so it 's no problem . industrial designer : yeah and you just project manager : so one one battery ? industrial designer : on uh yeah one battery . marketing : is that two or one ? user interface : project manager : it 's kinetic reserve . user interface : actually uh it 's a flexible thing . industrial designer : marketing : user interface : you just n uh marketing : now what is the whole day rating for that ? industrial designer : the excuse me ? marketing : whole day 's rating . user interface : marketing : what type of battery ? industrial designer : oh yeah it 's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh user interface : yeah yeah . industrial designer : if you uh like it 's exist . marketing : something like a two a_ , a_ three size batteries ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : and uh leave it uh alone , it 's alright . user interface : mm . at uh yeah . industrial designer : then the next time you pick it , oh project manager : industrial designer : it works . user interface : i forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button industrial designer : yeah just explain the button uh norman . user interface : yeah alright . this button is like the mouse is like a joystick , industrial designer : user interface : you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . industrial designer : user interface : you can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . so a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . so even though it 's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . marketing : and the lcd is this one , on the remote ? user interface : yeah . this is the version y that comes with lcd . marketing : yeah . user interface : here i present another version without the lcd . industrial designer : project manager : i think it 's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . if you user interface : uh okay this is new prototype uh . project manager : industrial designer : yeah it 's project manager : industrial designer : so we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . the second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh i have to put the microphone also . user interface : yeah yeah . marketing : industrial designer : so basically th it 's the same uh marketing : uh-huh and also the switch . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : basically it 's the same uh things uh uh as uh i presented before . but here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . press one button uh acting as a a enter button . user interface : mm . industrial designer : so um yeah according to what you said it 's more robust to the user . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh it 's also cheaper to produce . we can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . project manager : no four dollars , it 's good . user interface : marketing : and i think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , because that 's a major that 's a user interface : th actually th we 'll come to that point in our industrial designer : yeah it 's it 's it 's embed in the uh speech recognition system . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so marketing : and if you disable speech recognition system then ? user interface : w w i 'll i 'll come to that point later on . industrial designer : so norman will explain to you . marketing : mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm . project manager : and we will we will serve the charger with this ? user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah yeah of course mm . user interface : th they either these with the uh the the charger any project manager : with the remote control . user interface : in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . project manager : okay so the price of the charger included in the user interface : uh it 's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh . project manager : industrial designer : thank thank you . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and so mm-hmm . user interface : it 's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . i think we have to investigate more on that , but project manager : the price should be below twelve and a half euro . user interface : yeah . yeah project manager : well that 's so user interface : but as the marketing manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . project manager : we have we have just marketing : yeah people are willing to pay more , user interface : industrial designer : marketing : but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . project manager : the price of selling is twenty five euros . user interface : yeah . yeah . mm-hmm . project manager : and the price of production user interface : industrial designer : alright please uh go on norman with the special features . marketing : or uh user interface : yeah we 'll we 'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . if you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , marketing : user interface : so is uh modular . project manager : that 's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more . user interface : yeah yeah , for example the lcd , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , marketing : something like customised . yeah project manager : yeah . user interface : or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . industrial designer : user interface : you want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you do n't wan you pay less for the system you see . industrial designer : project manager : okay . marketing : mm hmm hmm hmm . user interface : so marketing : hmm okay . user interface : it 's pretty flexible in the yeah price . industrial designer : you also have the the the two other modules for the parental control project manager : but user interface : uh yeah yeah you should present that . industrial designer : that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control marketing : and this is other one ? user interface : industrial designer : i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : h here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch tv , up they come up with their modules , marketing : mm hmm hmm hmm . industrial designer : they just plug in it user interface : yeah industrial designer : and they can have all the control they want here . we also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , user interface : hmm . industrial designer : and it acts like the previous one , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you just plug in and it works . user interface : yeah marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . but in addition with simplicity . so that 's the best idea , the cond that that 's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : okay now we come to other important features that i did not tell you . the first one is the speech recogniser , again it 's detachable or add-on . and then we also have security feature for example this here oop industrial designer : user interface : it 's very robust , it does n't break and the material , what 's the material again ? industrial designer : the titanium project manager : titanium . industrial designer : and so it 's very uh user interface : again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is a_a_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . marketing : yeah that 's fine . user interface : lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . so when you finish watching your tv and you the you t you turn off the tv , uh and then there 's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that 's the or is it marketing : okay . user interface : that 's the reminder part . yeah and um and it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we did n't define the vocabulary so it 's up to the user to define marketing : mm hmm hmm hmm . user interface : so sorry ? project manager : industrial designer : marketing : user interface : and then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of tv programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . so instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the tv contents of the night . so it 's pretty powerful , and that 's that 's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . yeah . and and for the materials that is cheap to produce i think uh it 's quite clear from yeah . and also like the and the fancy designs yeah . project manager : what what 's user interface : maybe we can improve more on the design but project manager : maybe yeah . industrial designer : project manager : what 's the price to p to produce ? user interface : uh this is the industrial designer : well so the price to produce for uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . project manager : with with with the charge ? industrial designer : uh it 's about it the without without the charger marketing : with the charger ? project manager : okay . user interface : yeah industrial designer : it 's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . user interface : industrial designer : two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . so if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the lcd , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . user interface : yeah . project manager : we do n't have charger . marketing : i think we can use excel . industrial designer : it 's about project manager : we do n't have all the options . industrial designer : so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . project manager : charger we do n't have charger here either . user interface : yeah . project manager : no it 's industrial designer : but it 's just if you want all functionalities . project manager : it 's below the the the budget . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : excuse me ? project manager : it 's below the bu the budget . user interface : marketing : yeah it 's a nice input project manager : we marketing : but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . i think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu user interface : yeah ."
