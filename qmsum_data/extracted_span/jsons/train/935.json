    "answer": "helen mary jones am : can i just\u2014 ? just a supplementary to that\u2014you 've mentioned already , kirsty , the importance of youth services , and , particularly thinking voluntarily youth services , you 've given the commitment , when were talking about mudiad ysgolion meithrin earlier , that services that are part-funded by grants through the welsh government , for example , thinking of the national youth voluntary service\u2014will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well ? obviously , local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open , but , in terms of the direct support from welsh government , can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time ? kirsty williams am : no formal decision has been made , but if people are in receipt of a government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public\u2014 helen mary jones am : because it 's not safe . kirsty williams am : \u2014because it 's not safe to do so , i do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying , 'we 'll have our money back , thank you very much .
