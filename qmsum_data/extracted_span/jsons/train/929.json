    "query": "<s> what sort of conversations were they having with fe and he at the moment about how they decide the closures ?",
    "answer": "suzy davies am : okay . well , it 's a very general question , really . i appreciate you 've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations , but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion . we 're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly , which may impact on the answer you can give today , but what sort of conversations are you having with fe and he at the moment about how they decide ? kirsty williams am : well , you 're absolutely right . as we often say in this committee , universities are autonomous institutions\u2014a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question . universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them . colleges are in a similar position , looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods , and the bill , potentially , does give us more powers of intervention in both the fe and the he sector . suzy davies am : i might ask you about that in a minute , because i do n't even know what the bill says yet . kirsty williams am : huw , i do n't know if there 's anything you want to add . huw morris : no\u2014just to confirm what 's been said and also to add in that independent training providers , similarly autonomous , like colleges and universities , have been moving in the same direction . we 've been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that 's been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies . we 've got consistency in the approach and a common desire , and investment in moving towards online support for students . suzy davies am : and there 's still this safety net idea . certainly , colleges have indicated , as with schools , that , for the most vulnerable learners , they 'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis . huw morris : that 's my understanding , yes , and , again , we 've been in regular conversation with them about that . my understanding is that they 're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions . suzy davies am : that 's fair enough . and , presumably , education maintenance allowance will still be paid . kirsty williams am : yes . arrangements have been made to ensure that ema continues to be paid to all students who are entitled . suzy davies am : that 's right . you indicated that any welsh government support 's going to stay , whatever the circumstances are\u2014in your portfolio . kirsty williams am : yes . i 'm doing my best , but it 's an absolute yes on the ema . there will be no disruption to ema ."
