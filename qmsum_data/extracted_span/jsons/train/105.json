    "answer": "marketing : but , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that 's not gon na be possible . but if it 's trendy , if it 's fancy , it 's got some colour to it , if it 's very easy easy to use , if it 's got simple remote speech remote uh control , like i said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , i can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause i ca n't turn the tv on . so we 're gon na have to look at it in a in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design . project manager : marketing : but , price obviously we have to talk about . project manager : yep . so what do you think about uh the design ? do you think you can make it or uh industrial designer : d uh i 'm sorry ? project manager : what do you think about uh the design , uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition ? marketing : speech recognition . industrial designer : well , uh training is always an issue with uh commands . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so um might uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost . not sure how . but um anyway , um i i think also that uh this might impact the battery life . and um so , maybe what we 'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly so that uh y you know sen send power to it . so uh or maybe uh set it out in the sun and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things . user interface : it seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it 's a great feature , but if you 're watching tv , there 's a lot of ambient sound , and it 's words . it 's not just , you know , noises like something hitting . it 's actual speech , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the tv speech , and the the user 's speech . otherwise , you can say remote . industrial designer : off . user interface : but if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies , because they 've triggered the remote control and it 's turned off your tv . so , i think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then yeah , it 'd be a really good marketing gimmick . but , i think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation . industrial designer : very good point . marketing : because tha w with speech recognition uh th i 'm not that good at that idea user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : but th if it 's a one-word recognition , 'cause i know with telephones and cars and things i 've seen in the states , user interface : yeah . marketing : a friend of mine says call mom , and it calls up mom . user interface : yeah . marketing : 'kay the radio can be on and everything . because i think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : i do n't think it would come through a sentence in a television . if somebody 's speaking on the se the television , they 're not gon na stop and say remote , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . so i think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word user interface : oh yeah . yeah . no , i think it 's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements . marketing : like the t like the telephone . no because i this is this is years ago in the united states where we 're driving down and he said call home , and the telephone called immediately user interface : yeah . marketing : so well , that 's kinda cute . project manager : well , what i can uh suggest to you , christine , okay , uh if you need some uh the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , i can recommend you some companies like uh intel or i_b_m_ , okay , because they 're already in this uh speech recognition part , okay . and uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up . okay , and uh if you want , i can coordinate , okay , to get some information , okay , and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project . i do n't think it 's uh the difficult . and uh we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from uh what today . industrial designer : okay , we 'll find that out . marketing : from from your side uh , you 're gon na have to go back the management and s be more s precise . what do they want ? uh , a risk , take a risk on the market ? something that 's gon na cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ? project manager : yes . yep . marketing : because it has to be something totally different , has to be total totally new . something that nobody has right now . project manager : yeah but marketing : and it 's gon na cost . project manager : but end of the day , you 're the sales guy , so i will come back and sit on your head because uh you are going to give your sales projection , marketing : user interface : project manager : okay . it 's uh of course it 's uh good to uh tell the management how much it 's cost us marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and how much you are going to benefit , marketing : sure . sure . project manager : okay . and uh , so i do n't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of marketing : obviously . project manager : the money from this project . marketing : if the bottom line is positive . project manager : yes , okay i do n't mind to convince the the management , user interface : project manager : okay . the management says , okay , so they they do n't want certain facilities , which it 's already worked , okay , they want something uh new , okay . i think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree , i do n't think they 'll say no for that , okay . and uh i hope i can convince the management on that , okay . so if you have any uh new ideas , okay , for uh your you can always come up and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special , okay , coordination , okay , between any uh technical companies , which you can uh hide their technology backup , okay , for your uh functional design or technical design , okay , then i am ready to do that . and uh what 's your comments about uh"
