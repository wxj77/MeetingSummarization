    "answer": "mark reckless am : what have been the biggest benefits to wales of having estyn as an independent body inspecting schools and other institutions in wales compared to the work that ofsted has done in england ? meilyr rowlands : well , we have very good relationships with ofsted and with education scotland and the education training inspectorate in northern ireland . i would n't like to compare\u2014i do n't think it would be fair to compare ourselves . we do things slightly differently , but we benefit a lot from each other . we have inspectors from ofsted or from scotland , from northern ireland , on our inspections . we shadow them , and our inspectors go to their countries . so , we 're working quite closely with the home countries , but also further afield with holland and with the republic of ireland , for example . so , we 're always , all of us , learning from one another about what we think they do well and what they think we do well . we 're constantly learning from each other . i would n't think it 's fair for me to say what i think\u2014you know , where we 're better than another country . mark reckless am : of course . i 'm not asking you to criticise ofsted . i agree that would n't be appropriate . but i think what is fair for me to ask is : perhaps could you highlight one or two areas where you believe that estyn has a particular difference of emphasis and approach from ofsted ?"
