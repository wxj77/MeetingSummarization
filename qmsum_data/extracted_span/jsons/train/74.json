    "answer": "huw irranca-davies am : thank you , chair . if i can , just first of all , zoom in on the way in which we actually decide which schools need what support . so , one of the interesting questions for us is how do we use the different systems out there . so , we 've got the school categorisation system , which we 're familiar with . we 've also got estyn inspection reports , then we 've got other intelligence , including local intelligence on the ground . how do you decide from that ? how is it decided what schools need support , need challenge ? how do we do that ? kirsty williams am : well , you 're right : what we have is a variety of ways in which we can identify schools that need support , or need to be challenged on their practice . but it 's important not to confuse them either . so , our primary route to doing this is our school categorisation system . sometimes , and perhaps this is inevitable\u2014 . that system is primarily there as a triage system around identifying where our resource should be spent . so , our school improvement service\u2014it 's a risk-based approach , so they can evaluate where they need to put their time , effort and resource . sometimes , it 's used by other people for other things , but that is not its primary purpose ; its primary purpose there is not one of accountability , it is one of identifying risk and aligning that then to the support that is available . estyn\u2014now that is part of that accountability system . that is our method of holding schools and their governing bodies to account for their practice and for the work that they do . both systems , of course , are evolving . so , how we do categorisation has changed over a period of time . the elements that go into making that judgment around the levels of support have changed , and , of course , the estyn inspection regime is also changing . at the moment , schools are only inspected once every seven years . we 're moving to a system where estyn will be more regularly in schools . so , they are two systems , but they are different and they look at different things . but our categorisation system is how we look for those ways of identifying support for schools . huw irranca-davies am : and you 've made , with feedback over the last few years , adjustments to the way that the categorisation system works . are you content with where it is now , or do you see more adjustments being made ? have you got things in front of you that you 're getting feedback on saying 'well , we need to tweak this again a little bit ' ? kirsty williams am : so , that system has evolved over time . so , when it started , it was just a tool around secondary schools . now , it covers the breadth of schools . initially , on coming into office , when i first came in , it was purely driven by data , and it was also done in quartiles . so , there was a certain number of schools that had to be in the bottom , which drove practitioners mad . they were like 'ah , every year , there 's going to be some of us that have to be in the bottom quartile ' , because of the way in which it was arranged , which seemed very unfair to them . so , we 've changed that . it 's not just purely driven on data now ; there are other judgments\u2014the professional judgments of our challenge advisers are taken into account . and i would expect that situation to continue to evolve to align itself to our curriculum reform , and our changes in self-evaluation . so , it 's not a fixed point . i expect that that system will continue to evolve and change , so that it complements and assists in the reform journey as other parts of the system change . huw irranca-davies am : thanks for that . i think , for any impartial reader of the way that the trends have been going on this , there is some good news within that , in that , certainly , those schools that might have been identified as have been okay but coasting along , seem to be moving up the categories , although we still do have that\u2014 . well , it 's what the system is there to do , it 's to identify those schools that do need that additional support . and i like your analogy of a triage system\u2014'you 're fit ; keep on doing what you 're doing and do it well ; you need more support , we 'll put the support in . ' but , can i turn to those schools that are causing significant concern , and how we identify them ? the estyn chief inspector 's conclusions at the end of the 2017-18 report that these schools are not being identified early enough\u2014there 's a need to do something urgently about these concerns , particularly in secondary schools . have we addressed that ? are you content that we 've addressed that concern ? was he right ? kirsty williams am : no , the chief inspector is absolutely right\u2014absolutely right . i 've got no beef with that statement at all . in some ways , when a school goes into special measures , in a way , that 's a failure of the system , because that should have been identified sooner . so i 've got no beef , as i said , with the chief inspector saying that . huw irranca-davies am : so just to ask , bearing in mind the earlier discussion we were having , how is it that we do n't identify those schools ? kirsty williams am : that 's it\u2014you 're quite right . undoubtedly , what categorisation has done is led to a greater understanding , i think , on behalf of local education authorities ' and school improvement services ' knowledge about their schools . i think knowledge around schools is greatly enhanced by that process . but we are not there yet in terms of necessarily , then , moving those schools more quickly , once they 've been identified as needing the highest level of support to see improvement . and secondary schools is a particular , particular challenge . so you will have seen from the last publication of categorisation data that our primary sector continues to improve\u2014more and more and more of our primary schools are in a green rating , which is very satisfying to me . but we have got more of an issue with secondary schools , and we have a particular issue with the same schools being identified in that level of categorisation . so even though we 've identified them as needing that extra help , they are not moving at pace away from that system . so there are two things that we are doing at the moment . the first is , we are , again , looking at different sets of data that can give us even earlier warning systems that things are going wrong in a school\u2014and perhaps steve will explain later . for instance , staff sickness , and carefully monitoring staff sickness , because there is a direct correlation between high levels of staff sickness in a school and what is going on in the school . and steve can explain some of this work later . but we 're piloting a new approach to those schools that are causing concern . each local authority has been asked to identify two of their high schools that they are particularly worried about . and we have a new multi-agency approach , working with those schools to try and move them more forward . so it 's two from each region , a multi-agency panel , working with the school . and that multi-agency panel includes the school itself , the local authority , the regional consortia school improvement staff , estyn and welsh government\u2014as a multi-agency panel to support improvement in that school . so , for instance , what would normally happen , estyn would come in , estyn would make a judgment on the school\u2014requiring special measures or urgent improvement\u2014and estyn would go away . they 'd go away for six months , and then they 'd come back in six months , and they 'd make another judgment , 'no , still not good enough ' , and disappear for six months . we 're saying\u2014estyn and the welsh government have agreed that 's not the best approach ; estyn need to be part of the solution , rather than just coming and making a judgment . the initial feedback from this trial is very , very positive . actually , we 've had local authorities coming to us and saying , 'can we put more schools in ? rather than just having two of our high schools , can we engage more in this project and this pilot ? ' it 's being evaluated by cardiff metropolitan university and swansea university , so we 're having some academic overview to see , actually , does this approach work , can we evidence it\u2014that it actually makes a difference ? and it 's actually\u2014i 'd like to claim all the credit for it , but it 's actually not dissimilar to something that 's happening in scotland as well . but we knew that carrying on doing the same old thing clearly was n't moving these schools , we needed a new approach , and this is what we 're doing at the moment . so it 's relatively new , but the initial feedback is positive . steve , i do n't know\u2014 steve davies : i think your important point is about , 'what about the schools that are sliding in that direction ? ' and it 's bringing together what we know from estyn , but also , critically , local authorities have knowledge of their schools , and so do consortia . we 've got to be better at bringing those together . so , the minister gave the example of staff sickness\u2014not always a trigger , but it 's one of those . if you look at movement of pupils out of a school , you can look at complaints , you can look at , actually , emerging increased use of hr resources that a school pulls on a local authority . none of these have been pushed up into the public domain , but they 're important antennae . the point the minister made about estyn as well is , historically , when they go into special measures , estyn , at the end of that week , call in , historically , either the region or the local authority , they will feed back to one of them , and then they go away . so , they are staying with it . so , we are brining together the knowledge . but , as the minister said , we want to keep a very clear distinction between the accountability and the transparency to the public , to parents , with the very detailed collective work of that multi-agency group to actually make that difference over time . huw irranca-davies am : okay . so , does that\u2014 . i 'd love to go further , but time is against us . does that deal with the issue of the schools that have been identified in those categories of requiring significant improvement and requiring special measures ? are those the ones that will be identified now , or is that above and beyond that again ? kirsty williams am : well , those are the ones that are primarily at the forefront of our minds , but this way of sharing data better , to step in earlier , is part of our attempt to address what the chief inspector says about stepping in early\u2014not waiting until a school gets into special measures and a formal judgment from estyn of that , but actually using that intelligence to get support in there earlier . the three elements that that multi-agency approach look at are : what are the fundamentals that need addressing in this school ? what is the capacity of the school itself to be able to address those fundamentals ? and , what extra support needs to go into that senior management team and the governing body to get those fundamentals addressed ? and actually , what does sustainable improvement look like ? because , again , one of the issues , sometimes , that happens is , a school goes into a category with estyn , there 's a big push and a big , 'we must do something ' and the school comes out , but actually , that improvement is not sustainable . it 's the low-hanging fruit ; it 's the easy wins that have been achieved , but actually , perhaps some of the fundamental challenges underlying in that school have n't been addressed in that process . so , this is about what will sustainable improvement look like in six months , what 's it going to look like in 12 months and what 's it going to look like in 18 months . so , actually , a more strategic , longer term approach to real change in a school rather than , perhaps , some of the easy-to-fix items that make a school as if it 's doing better , but we really have n't tackled some of the underlying problems that make that school vulnerable to slipping back . does that make sense ? lynne neagle am : i 've got a couple of supplementaries on\u2014 . sorry ? kirsty williams am : does that make sense ? lynne neagle am : yes . we 've got a couple of supplementaries on this , first from suzy and then from si\u00e2n . suzy davies am : thank you for that , chair . obviously , i 'm pleased to hear that this work is being done , but i 'm wondering\u2014 . what strikes me , in the recent past , at least , particularly as we 've got the usual suspects in this category\u2014 . i 've got to ask myself why it is that councils have been reluctant , perhaps , to step in with these schools earlier , particularly as they 've got consortia or middle-tier support as well . has there been a deficit in that space that has meant that councils do n't feel equipped to step in ? i just do n't really get it why they 've been reluctant to step in so far . if they 've been nervous about doing it , because they do n't feel that they 've got the tools to do it , then i think that 's pretty important , because as you were saying , we were talking about fundamentals ; surely , councils have been able to deal with fundamentals , and more importantly , consortia up until now . because , obviously , we 're asking these players to give us evidence at some point , so perhaps i 'd like to challenge them on how come we 're here now . kirsty williams am : and rightly so . suzy davies am : i 'm not laying this at your door . kirsty williams am : and rightly so . i guess each local authority will have an explanation for each individual school , i suspect . what 's crucial to me is that we have to\u2014 . i see our job as corralling the collective effort , and i think , for too long in the system , there has been a lack of co-ordination . so , this is about bringing and corralling a collective effort to address this , going forward , in more sustainable way . and i think it does come back to this issue around self-evaluation and a willingness to be open , honest and upfront about some of the challenges that we 've got . it 's not easy , is it ? it 's not easy to accept or to acknowledge sometimes when things are\u2014 suzy davies am : that they do n't know how to do this . kirsty williams am : well , that they 're going badly , or perhaps they do n't know exactly how to make the difference . so this approach , as i said , is a new way of trying to coral that collective effort across the board . but , i do n't know if steve\u2014because you 've done other roles in the system , so perhaps you 've got a different insight . steve davies : i think you 're right . the variation across the country , across local authorities\u2014 . there are some local authorities that we 've worked with and we identify have taken the appropriate action . there are others that we 're working with , and yes , at its best , it 's done as a joint exercise where they use their regional school improvement service to help in the identification that there is a need for this . they take advice as to what the action is , whether it is , as the minister said , in the more significant areas , a board , or whether a warning notice comes in terms of standards or finance . so , we 're working with them and we 're working with the welsh local government association to share that practice . an example of that work is : we have done a development training session for cabinet members for education , and scrutiny leads for education across wales , and all 22 local authorities came to that and engaged with that . that was partly about self-improvement , but it was also about where significant issues arise , you have to constructively confront them . and that comes with what the region knows , and increasingly , we 're looking to have it consistently across 22 local authorities , so they are collecting all the additional data that we referred to earlier , so they can legitimately hold a mirror up and say , 'this is a real concern that we have . we 're not punishing you , but we 're registering the seriousness , and we want you to address it . ' and we 're making progress . i believe it 's genuinely more consistent now , but i 'd be lying if i said that there was consistency across all 22 local authorities . suzy davies am : thank you . i 'm conscious of time . lynne neagle am : okay . i 've got a supplementary from si\u00e2n , then back to huw . sian gwenllian am : because you are moving to a more sophisticated approach in terms of identifying problems sooner , and so can offer the support earlier , is it time to think about moving away from the system of categorisation entirely ? that is , has the categorisation system reached the end of its usefulness , and is the multi-agency approach , this more sophisticated approach , a better way , ultimately , of being able to assist schools in moving forward ? kirsty williams am : i think , si\u00e2n , as i said earlier , the categorisation system has evolved over time , and my expectation is that it will continue to evolve , because it has to be consistent with our overall approach to school improvement and raising standards . i expect oecd will have feedback for us on this important part of our system , and we 'll wait to see exactly what they say about it , but as i said in answer to huw irranca-davies earlier , i have n't got a closed mind ; we 've demonstrated over the last four years our willingness to change the system to make it a smarter system , and we will continue to keep that under review , as we move forward . if i could just go back briefly , it does n't sound like a very exciting thing , does it , when we say we 've been doing work with the wlga , with cabinet members , but also scrutiny , because that 's a really important part of the jigsaw as well , is actually local government scrutiny of the performance of your education portfolio holder and the leadership of your council . so this is about trying to up the ante on all sides , so that those issues around 'what are you doing in your local authority to use the powers that you have ? ' you know , sometimes , making sure that everybody in that authority\u2014those in power and those who are there to hold those in power to account\u2014have the necessary skills , knowledge and understanding to do that appropriately . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . huw , briefly . huw irranca-davies am : yes , briefly . i only have one final question . we 've talked a lot about early identification ; getting in there and then managing the improvement , this triage approach there , and then getting some grip of it , as well , in doing all of that . but my question now is on what we currently have . i wo n't touch on the primary schools , but let 's just look at secondary schools\u201411 per cent of secondary schools inspected in the last two academic years judged as unsatisfactory , needing urgent improvement . there will always be secondary schools and primary schools that hit moments of crisis for one reason or another , but 11 per cent to me , and to any layperson , would seem unreasonably high . are you\u2014 ? it would be daft to ask you if you 're content . what is a level that you would be content with of having schools in red category in wales ? kirsty williams am : you 're right . schools will need different levels of support at different points , and sometimes , it 's not because of a crisis . so , for instance , in my region , we do have an increase in the number of schools in the amber category . that 's because we 've seen in that particular region a number of headteachers retire because they 've reached retirement age , and there are new headteachers . well , that is a moment of risk in the school\u2014when senior leadership changes . nothing else has changed in that school , but the simple fact that you have a new leader , sometimes in those cases it might be their first headship . that means that that school is going to need a little bit of extra support , so it is n't always just a crisis that needs extra support , there are just general things that happen in the life of a school that could lead to it . but you 're absolutely right\u2014we have a particular challenge in the secondary sector where we have not been able to move individual schools forward at pace . and 11 per cent is not acceptable to me , huw , which is why we have introduced this new pilot to address those schools where , persistently , we have concerns about their ability to move forward . if we 'd have carried on doing the same thing , i suspect we would have just carried on getting the same result\u2014hence the need for a new approach to those schools that are causing concern . steve davies : very briefly , the things we talked about earlier was how we measure the performance of schools , particularly at gcses , with a narrow focus . as was said earlier , some of these are the same groups\u2014they trip in and then they do n't come out . our belief is , from research , that they concentrate on squeezing the pips to get the grades up in some small areas for a period of time , and you can do that by targeting and immersing them . estyn can tick the box to say your grades have got better , but we have n't handled the serious underpinning issues\u2014leadership , teaching and learning , and bringing those together . as the minister said , what does sustainable improvement look like in six , 12 , 18 months ? it is n't just , as important as they are , getting those exam grades up a bit . they 're the fundamental\u2014 . and if they 're all agreed as the indicators at the outset , we 're more likely\u2014 . so it 's multi-agency ; it 's not a little activity , it 's a major strategy ."
