    "query": "<s> summarize the additional ideas on function design which the team brought up based on previous presentations .",
    "answer": "project manager : okay . okay , let 's talk about all of our we 'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let 's um wrap up this one , and i 'm gon na go back to my powerpoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might 've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . wait , come back . alright . sorry , let 's go through this . alright . here we go . new product requirements . first it 's only going to be a tv remote . we 're trying not to over-complicate things . so no d_v_d_ , no tivo , no stereo . industrial designer : okay . project manager : it 's not gon na be multi-functional . hey . and we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . we 're trying to get our name out there in the world . okay . and you know what teletext is ? user interface : yeah . project manager : in states we do n't have it , but um it 's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , user interface : i know . marketing : what is it ? user interface : project manager : it 's very um bland looking , it 's just text on the screen , user interface : yeah , project manager : not even user interface : it 's like black , black and white kind of project manager : yeah , just black with just text . marketing : like running along the bottom ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : you can also get the kind of the tv guide so user interface : it 'll give you the sports . marketing : wait , is it like the weather channel where it 's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? project manager : kind of . user interface : except the entire screen . project manager : yeah it 's the whole screen . industrial designer : it 's the entire screen is just running information at random . project manager : so anyway user interface : you can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , industrial designer : seemingly . user interface : you know it 's like project manager : right . marketing : so it 's like a separate channel from like what you 're watching ? project manager : right . but it 's becoming out-dated now , because of the internet . user interface : yeah . project manager : nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so those are our new product requirements . alright . mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay . marketing : okay . industrial designer : so , do we have to include the company colour within that ? project manager : yes . it 's part of the logo . okay . user interface : company colour being yellow . project manager : what we 're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we 'll close up the meeting . so . alright . whatever . okay . so our target group is you mentioned um older people ? would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : because i think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically user interface : it 's gon na make it nicer . yeah . project manager : non-technically challenged people are gon na use it . i mean they want something user-friendly , so industrial designer : mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : 'cause they 're saying they only use ten per cent of them , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . project manager : okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , i mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right ? or kids ? marketing : no , kids need to know how to use a remote , i would think . industrial designer : most of them will intuitively pick it up though . marketing : they got ta change between disney channel , cartoon network . project manager : okay , so we 're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range marketing : yeah , i think we need it all . project manager : um what about technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? marketing : um i would say we should say dumber than the average person . project manager : okay . user interface : we should go for the lowest denominator . marketing : yeah . project manager : right , okay . so so they need no technical experience to operate user interface : high school educated . industrial designer : how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gon na be able to make it no . project manager : okay . and we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . so we said it needs to send messages to the tv , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . so if you have something just say it and we 'll add it to my meeting minutes . user interface : well it 's channel , on-off button , volume , mute . project manager : mm-hmm , volume . marketing : and channel . yeah . those are the most important ones . project manager : right . and we wan na keep um i 'll make a note here that we wan na keep the number of buttons down . correct , because people only use ten percent . marketing : yeah . project manager : 'kay . hey , what else ? industrial designer : do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? user interface : project manager : i think so . what do you marketing : sure , yeah . project manager : a finding kind of device or marketing : i need we we need a like homing device . project manager : yeah , ho homing device . industrial designer : like if this is gon na get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? user interface : oh right yeah okay . project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : tracking . project manager : okay . marketing : because people really are looking for a remote that 's more high-tech . project manager : right . industrial designer : what if we gave it a charger ? and on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it 's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . user interface : but you got a base . marketing : do you think people 'll really go for that though ? industrial designer : it 's useful for the remote phone . marketing : because yeah . project manager : would that add to our costs at all , i wonder ? marketing : i would think so , because you 'd have to develop a base . project manager : right . user interface : well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . industrial designer : yeah . rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . i i think we can make a decision about that later . uh we 'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . so that would include battery source power source rather . is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? and we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . marketing : right . user interface : well , then we could if we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . marketing : well , th there 's the people who desire speech recognition , there 's the different demog demographics have different desires , i do n't know if you guys ge project manager : you could um we could hook it up . marketing : it would n't copy onto the the thing 'cause it 's black , but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . so basically older people do n't really care . it 's really the people twenty five to thirty five . i feel those are the people that really watch a lot of tv though . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : they 're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and industrial designer : project manager : and if and if we introduced it when they 're this age , they 're going to probably always buy a remote that has user interface : well marketing : just sitcoms and stuff . right . user interface : well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , marketing : so user interface : 'cause then you 've already got remote in your hand , why you just gon na speak to the remote , project manager : right . user interface : whereas if you just speak in general and you do n't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . project manager : yeah . and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . if we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . marketing : right . project manager : a certain phrase then it could beep . i dunno . just throwing it out there . marketing : yeah . project manager : well marketing : user interface : still fifteen minutes . project manager : okay , anything else we wan na discuss ? user interface : um . well , do we wan na include the numbers like zero through nine ? can we conceive of leaving them out ? marketing : wait , on the remote itself ? user interface : yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . project manager : how how , marketing : well , we definitely need those . project manager : yeah , how would you leave those out ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : well , i do n't know , i mean , if you can like well project manager : unless you could say the channel . user interface : i do n't know , if there 's just a way of leaving them out ? industrial designer : i think people would find that too foreign . project manager : yeah , that 's true . marketing : yeah . project manager : and also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . marketing : you definitely need project manager : i used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . so i could n't whenever i got cable , i had to get a new tv . industrial designer : it 's when we get satellite . project manager : mm . get your own remote , or digital cable . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : 'kay . um . i guess , we 're gon na discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . um . industrial designer : yeah , 'cause i do n't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so project manager : 'kay . and do n't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . user interface : the colour being yellow ? marketing : wait . project manager : i 'm guessing . and the r_r_ . user interface : and how do we marketing : i feel like a ye i feel like a yellow one would be too garish . industrial designer : r_ the double r_ . project manager : we could just have the logo in yellow , user interface : ca n't make it entirely project manager : or maybe a yellow light for the keys . industrial designer : or is the l marketing : or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights . industrial designer : yeah , yellow could be and it could does n't have to be huge . user interface : well if you have like a marketing : yeah . user interface : hang on . if you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the r_r_ . project manager : right . so we 've simplified , we do n't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , user interface : right , yeah . project manager : or no menu buttons . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we 've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers yeah . user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : um can we go back to i 'm gon na look really quickly back at those user interface : two examples . project manager : examples and see if there is anything . user interface : yeah . project manager : which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ? user interface : oh , it 's a yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? project manager : the tv . i think that that 's fine just for the tv . i mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? user interface : well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it 's like the buttons that you do n't use as much , but occasionally you will use . and so it 's like marketing : yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . it 's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like i know f k living in los angeles it 's tons of spanish network television if it has english sub-titles it 's definitely helpful . project manager : could n't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the tv that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , user interface : i do n't well , i do n't know . project manager : you know ? user interface : right . marketing : so we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . project manager : for the menus . user interface : well , that could be no you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : that 's true . user interface : channel is just up and down . marketing : yeah , okay . okay , yeah . user interface : and then add a project manager : something that looks mayb you know . marketing : such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . project manager : y right , right right right . user interface : yeah . project manager : that one ? user interface : so we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , project manager : right . user interface : including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now project manager : in the middle perhaps . user interface : included in the menu . marketing : ooh , i just got an idea for a design . project manager : good . anybody have anything else they 'd like to bring up in this meeting ?"
