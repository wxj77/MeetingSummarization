    "answer": "marketing : okay , i 'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . the trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . 'kay . the method i used was like i told i watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . so we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . findings i made . the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . the second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the lcd screen that 's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . and the third thing is it should be easy to use . i think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . the personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff . industrial designer : fruity ? user interface : grass green . industrial designer : fruity . marketing : yeah . like that . the round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . industrial designer : mm . okay . marketing : it should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s sponge bob like things . user interface : let 's build it into a sponge . industrial designer : marketing : th elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . they liked square shapes with round edges . and hard materials like wood , um titanium . they those kind of materials they liked . this is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . and then i th i i personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like project manager : oh y marketing : this or something . it 's it 's a bit like a banana . and the colour should be yellow , or something . and for the elderly people just plain old . because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ? user interface : it was one remote , i think , marketing : different colours , yeah . user interface : different colours . marketing : we should decide whether it 's going to be with round shapes . i think like my colleague , you said , is that 's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the ipod or something , with round squares . simple but easy to use . so that 's it . project manager : so for the older people , a more traditional uh form . industrial designer : okay . marketing : that is my yeah , like the older o older colours i can maybe user interface : you could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . i do n't know which shape you should should take , marketing : yeah . colours th the elderly people"
