    "answer": "marketing : okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . sorry . there we go . um so , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . i also spoke with fashion experts in milan , new york and paris . and i looked at the design reports from previous years , here at real remote . um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . um , so i 'll list the three most important aspects that i 've come across . um , and they , they 're each more important than the one that comes after it . uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . um , this should be our priority , as we 've been saying . the second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . so , i think we 've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates . um , so it looks like we 'll be able to keep on track with that . and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . so , pretty basic there . and the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in paris and milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . again , we 've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . um so , my personal preferences here , um of course , as we , we 've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and i 'd like to stick to that . the fruits and vegetable themes , i do n't know if that 's going to work for us . it sounds something that you 'd use on kitchenware . i do n't know if we wan na do it on remotes . user interface : marketing : it could be one of the options . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we 're gon na stick to that . and then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness . project manager : yeah . yeah , it 's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that i find rather jarring . everything else we can really , we can really industrial designer : it is strange . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . marketing : it 's , it 's a little but it , it 's everywhere . industrial designer : well user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : so maybe we i 've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . user interface : project manager : yeah . marketing : but i i think , i think if we stick to tv based , you know , maybe tv shows , or project manager : but they still need to um fit into people 's decor though . user interface : yeah . marketing : or colour schemes . industrial designer : we i think we possibly could take a more abstract design . marketing : right . industrial designer : like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . and then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . i mean we do n't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : or a strawberry seed or a leaf . user interface : yeah , yeah . marketing : the the essence of strawberry . yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that 's fits in more with what we 're doing . instead of fruits and vegetables , user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : just if you look at it straightforward , it 's a bit yeah . it does n't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that 's the current theme . project manager : yeah . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : but may maybe we could go more directly , i do n't know . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but initially , i dunno . i think if we just sort of tone it down a bit . project manager : tone it down . yeah , industrial designer : yeah and like not , not marketing : i guess , yeah . project manager : like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : or banana-shaped . marketing : one thing i was thinking though is"
