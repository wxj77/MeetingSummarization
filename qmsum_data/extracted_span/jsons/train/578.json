    "query": "<s> how did kirsty williams am plan to narrow the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers ?",
    "answer": "dawn bowden am : yes , my last question is really about the potential for the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers . is that a concern for you ? i 'm thinking particularly in relation to those less affluent families in having access to technology and so on . what kind of concerns do you have about that and what are we looking to do to try to ensure that that does n't actually play out ? kirsty williams am : thank you , dawn . all of the statistics would tell us that learning loss and the gap , potentially , will affect those more vulnerable children the most . clearly , we will want to consider that as we think about what the new normal for education may look like , or as we develop into future phases . depending on where that child is in their educational journey , of course , the needs and the potential for loss are slightly different . so , for instance , when we 're thinking about very young children , we could be thinking about a lack of social interaction and the development of oracy skills . of course , that , potentially , then will have a knock-on to their ability to learn to read and then to write , for instance . for other children who are , perhaps , older and heading towards formal examinations , the challenge when they return to school will be a slightly different one . i 'm not sure , chair , whether you want me to give some further details about our continuity-of-learning plan and how we are looking to address digital disadvantage now , or whether there are questions later . lynne neagle am : well , i 've got a question on that coming up , so , if it 's okay , dawn , we 'll go on to that now . before we do that , i was just going to ask how the welsh government is paying due regard to the united nations convention on the rights of the child and , obviously , the right children and young people have to an education . i was going to ask you about the risk of inequality due to varying access to digital resources , which are so important in ensuring continuity of learning ."
