    "answer": "user interface : and uh there is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like you can basically if you have a multiple functionality , say tv , v_c_r_ or something i say it to the tv and the tv , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information . marketing : mm . mm . i like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like b_b_c_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . that 's a good idea . user interface : yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , industrial designer : . yeah . user interface : even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to marketing : hmm . mm . yeah i really like that idea . industrial designer : so what functionalities do you suggest for that ? for facing this problem ? user interface : so it it it 's like it limited one . in the present market i saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : which should n't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . basically you want you do n't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel . marketing : maybe ten channels , yeah at the most . user interface : yeah some ten twelve channel information . you know you do n't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that . industrial designer : okay . user interface : and uh basically uh it depends like the remote with lcd display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you do n't know really which functionality is now , so i am using the tv so every time i use it , it could be like , for example i can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so i press it so the display says , okay , i 'm in tv or d_v_d_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm-hmm . oh yeah yeah yeah mm . user interface : to model the functionalities will increase actually , and for you and you might want you do n't want separate keys for all of them . you ca n't . and uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . so these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : i personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , industrial designer : user interface : and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi joe , or something like that , you know , and uh marketing : but a coffee machine , there 's not too many words they 'd be using with that it 's a it 's a small vocabulary . user interface : yeah you you wo n't be using it , so it 's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word marketing : mm . mm . user interface : and it 's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like uh it could indicate you 're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : at the same time , if it 's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also marketing : user interface : or industrial designer : and you want okay for coming back to one point marketing : two thirty five supposed to finish . industrial designer : y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? some of them ? user interface : yeah you can let them to do that . industrial designer : and uh is n't that too difficult for the we want w i do n't know if we still want the um r_c_ to be easy to use , that 's the compromise . user interface : n no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : like for example uh i would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . mm . i think you can do it both ways . user interface : so it de industrial designer : yeah . marketing : you can have it so it 's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , industrial designer : a standard . marketing : or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um yes but but i do user interface : so industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some kind of indicator , so it could be a blinking option of l_e_d_ it could actually be used to detect also . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : if it 's in a dark room you can basically detect it also . marketing : mm . hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , user interface : so marketing : so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something . user interface : no actually i if i it is like you know it tells you um , it can be for two purposes , like if you have an lcd display and all those things it 's not going to be the standard remote , marketing : mm . hmm . user interface : which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of d_c_ . it may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . and then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something industrial designer : it 's true . user interface : and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery , well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : you know . project manager : 'kay good . industrial designer : . user interface : yeah so industrial designer : i do n't know how if if i have time to talk about the project manager : mm yes um i would user interface : you you have time some more ? yep . project manager : yes yes you can you can still . we have time . marketing : user interface : sure you can you know . industrial designer : okay . so what i 'm gon na present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a r_c_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so the method is ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like , and uh what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and i will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . so there are two uh different types of uh um two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control . project manager : nice . industrial designer : uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver . and uh yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components um . so you finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh uh that 's , with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um . so electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it 's easier to mass produce and assemble . and uh so i think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know v_ v_l_s_i_ or f_p_g_a_ uh high technology , user interface : yeah mm mm-hmm . industrial designer : and this is important , and also we 'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so my personal design we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . if it 's plastic or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or project manager : well well industrial designer : i dunno . marketing : project manager : m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . industrial designer : yes . yes . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm just have a yeah industrial designer : yeah like they do in with cars i think . yeah inside the car marketing : just the veneer on it , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . so they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse . and uh very cheap lcds , so liquid crystal displays , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so i 'm wondering , i think we might be able to integrate lcd into our r_c_ . and the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do . project manager : so i f i think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um so i understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features . industrial designer : exactly yeah that 's a very good idea , we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it 's called f_p_g_a_ chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh lcd project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . user interface : d well project manager : do you think that 's feasible ? user interface : yeah that 's uh that 's something which i wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . for example if f if you want to put wood i would n't suggest for wood industrial designer : yeah . user interface : uh 'cause it 's i think it 's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood . industrial designer : okay . i agree on that . yeah . user interface : it will be much ch much expensive th though it 's the most natural thing , but project manager : yes but i can i think uh i think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials user interface : yeah . yeah project manager : which which come with a with another price . user interface : it 's uh yeah we we can give a preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it 's much better with that rather than going for project manager : do do you agree ? marketing : mm yeah sure . industrial designer : yeah but i it 's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh graphs or i do n't know uh user interface : yeah . industrial designer : user interface designer you could maybe uh help us on that . project manager : ma i i think uh for next meeting we c you two can present a real design . uh so drawing it on the board . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : okay . industrial designer : perfect yeah . project manager : and then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh . so um let let 's say next meeting w you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price . user interface : yeah sure . yeah we will uh yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case which can be later uh fancied up with uh with addit uh additional uh , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . but that that that that can be done later . user interface : yeah . project manager : we now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control . user interface : . industrial designer : yeah customized . user interface : okay . we can give them smooth keys , you know . smooth keys with bigger s uh so that you know the the problem most of the time we 've seen , the keys is that it 's small , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together marketing : so is there any of these that you 're looking at particularly user interface : to marketing : or is this just ideas ? user interface : oh you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and uh now you can , for example , as i was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . marketing : hmm . mm . mm . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : at the same time , it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this r_s_i_ and all problem . marketing : mm yeah . project manager : yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing i think . user interface : uh big keys may better for them actually and uh marketing : you see ? industrial designer : i agree yeah , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and not too m too many keys of course yeah . marketing : mm well project manager : no no . marketing : one i 've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that 's actually got a cover on the bottom user interface : yeah . marketing : so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys . project manager : mm mm mm . user interface : yeah . project manager : mm w but then you have still have uh when you do n't use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control which you do n't use . so maybe it 's possible uh , i do n't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you do n't use that much . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm . yeah . um yeah i 've seen that before too . anoth another like b user interface : yeah . marketing : it flips up and then you 've got another layer of buttons underneath . user interface : yes . yeah so it 's something like this , the model here s you can put the keys marketing : but i 've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well . industrial designer : that 's what you mean ? project manager : yes i i th that 's what i mean user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : so i mean something like like a book . marketing : i like this one . i like the shape of this one . user interface : yeah . marketing : can we have can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box industrial designer : yeah i like also this one . marketing : that 's a maybe curved or something . user interface : yeah , mm ."
