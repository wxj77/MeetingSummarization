    "answer": "llyr gruffydd am : the reason i was asking was i wanted to understand what lessons the government is taking from that three-year investment , really , and how , maybe , you 're applying some of those lessons to your wider school improvement programme . i know professor mel ainscow identified six interconnected lessons , although i also note that the cabinet secretary did n't actually meet him for about six or seven months after coming into post . so , i 'm just wondering , can you give us confidence that , actually , you are serious about taking lessons from schools challenge cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda ?"
