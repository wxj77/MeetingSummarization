    "query": "<s> what did hefin david am concern about the fee and access plans ?",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : well , no , not in the sense that they 've brought them to me to talk about specifically . from my perspective , fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs , and , really , i 'd like to think about outputs and outcomes , more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan , not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them . i think , certainly , to really understand the success of the fee and access plan , you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to , and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time . because , when you think about it , you write the plan and then you 're into it , and then , the next thing you know , you 're writing your next year 's plan . so , i think there 's an opportunity there to look to restructure . so , do i see a place for fee and access plans going forward , as part of our outcome agreements ? yes , i do . can we do them differently to make them more effective ? yes , i think we can . hefin david am : so , why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better ? kirsty williams am : well , i think they 're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation . so , fee and access plans are there to address an issue around , primarily , changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that . so , that 's part of a wider piece of work that i 'd want to see as an outcome agreement . but , as i said , i think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity , rather than the inputs of the activity , over a longer period of time , is probably a more effective way of doing it . i think it 's still\u2014 . in a way , it 's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked , because we need to know what 'll happen to those students in the future . but undoubtedly , despite the limitations of them , i do think we 're making progress in terms of access , but i do n't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements . hefin david am : no , i appreciate that , and some of the things you 're saying reflect some of the discussions we 've had , but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans does n't work , particularly given the fact that , four years on , early fee and access plans are still being evaluated . there 's a real problem there . so , what you 're saying\u2014can i just pin down what you 're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that 's longer term and outcome focused . kirsty williams am : that 's my preference . so , i think the principle\u2014i 'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve , but i think there are better ways of doing it , and i think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better . hefin david am : so , with that in mind , i think we 're talking about the future of the bill , the consultation on the pcet reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing , have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like , for example , universities wales and others ? kirsty williams am : on the bill or on fee and access plans in particular ? hefin david am : i 'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation , so with that in mind , with things like that , have you had further discussion ? kirsty williams am : oh my goodness me , civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals . i meet on a regular basis with both hefcw\u2014i meet separately with the vice-chancellors , and i 've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs , and perhaps we 'll come on to issues of governance later . so , we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am : i suppose the message i 'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders . that 's the message i 've received . now , i 've got no evidence to say it has or has n't happened , but that 's the message i 've received ."
