    "answer": "hefin david am : i 'll move on to managing risk , if that 's okay . the feedback from universities wales suggests that , with the outcome of the 2015 act , institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers . do you think that act has struck the right balance ? kirsty williams am : i think the act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions . hefin david am : okay . those were the words used by universities wales\u2014 kirsty williams am : no , no , i 'm not disagreeing . my view is : i believe that the act has struck that proportionality . when you look at public moneys going into institutions , i think that the act is proportionate , myself . hefin david am : so , do you think it 's in the interests of students , then , to be at private institutions\u2014 ? i 've seen those private institutions and how they operate ; i 've seen them at first-hand\u2014they do n't operate to the same rigour as public institutions , and they 're less regulated . huw morris : can i just chip in ? i think that the category 'private ' covers quite a wide range of things , and many private institutions are also charities . we do n't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries , but stanford and harvard would count as private universities . so , i think we need to be careful in focusing on the inherent quality of things . we 've made charitable status a key reference point in the operation of things at the moment . i think there has been attention drawn to some private providers , particularly in england , but i would n't tar them all with the same brush , necessarily . hefin david am : but they fall outwith\u2014if they 're not charitable providers running validated courses , for example , they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in wales . kirsty williams am : so , we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis , so it 's back to the issue of proportionality , is n't it ? so , you are automatically regulated for all your courses , if you 're one of our main universities , but there is a process that is run by hefcw on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers . and as huw said , i think we should recognise the nature of that is very , very , very small in wales , and there is a process to ensure quality provision . if there were concerns about the quality of that provision , that course could be deregulated . hefin david am : and i 'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in wales , but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change , particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students ? do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 act , as designed , was n't equipped for that , and will the next act , then , be equipped ?"
