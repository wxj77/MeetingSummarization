    "answer": "professor d : um , o one thing i i wanted to or you can tell a good joke and then everybody 's laughing and you get a chance to g break in . phd g : seniority . professor d : but . but . um . you know , the other thing i was thinking was that , um these all these interesting questions are , of course , pretty hard to answer with , uh u you know , a small amount of data . so , um i wonder if what you 're saying suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have , um a a fair number of meetings with , uh a smaller number of people . right ? i mean we most of our meetings are uh , meetings currently with say five , six , seven , eight people should we really try to have some two - person meetings , or some three - person meetings and re record them just to to to beef up the the statistics on that ? postdoc f : that 's a control . well , it seems like there are two possibilities there , i mean i it seems like if you have just two people it 's not really , y like a meeting , w is not as similar as the rest of the of the sample . it depends on what you 're after , of course , but it seems like that would be more a case of the control condition , compared to , uh an experimental condition , with more than two . grad h : mm - hmm . professor d : well , liz was raising the question of of whether i it 's the number there 's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there , postdoc f : mm - hmm . professor d : and , um if you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you 'd still have the visuals . you would n't have that difference also that you have in the say , in switchboard data . uh postdoc f : mm - hmm . yeah , i 'm just thinking that 'd be more like a c control condition . professor d : yeah . postdoc f : mm - hmm . phd e : yeah . grad h : well , but from the acoustic point of view , it 's all good . phd e : is the same . professor d : yeah , acoustic is fine , but phd g : if if the goal were to just look at overlap you would you could serve yourself save yourself a lot of time but not even transcri transcribe the words . phd b : well , i was thinking you should be able to do this from the acoustics , on the close - talking mikes , professor d : yeah . grad h : well , that 's the that was my my status report , phd b : right ? postdoc f : you 've been working on that . phd b : right , i mean adam was phd e : yeah . postdoc f : yeah . grad h : so once we 're done with this stuff discussing , phd b : right . i mean , not as well as what i mean , you would n't be able to have any kind of typology , obviously , professor d : yeah . phd b : but you 'd get some rough statistics . grad h : mm - hmm . professor d : but what what do you think about that ? do you think that would be useful ? i 'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two - person meetings or something . phd b : i guess my my first comment was , um only that um we should n not attribute overlaps only to meetings , but maybe that 's obvious , maybe everybody knew that , professor d : yeah . phd b : but that in normal conversation with two people there 's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap , and that it would be interesting to look at whether there are these kinds of constraints that jane mentioned , that what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn , professor d : mm - hmm . phd b : you know , because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn , but pretty quickly there 're they back off and you go back to this sort of only one person at a time with one person interrupting at a time . professor d : mm - hmm . phd b : so , i do n't know . to answer your question i it i do n't think it 's crucial to have controls but i think it 's worth recording all the meetings we can . so , um you know . professor d : well , ok . phd e : yeah . phd g : i i have an idea . phd b : d i would n't not record a two - person meeting just because it only has two people . grad h : right . phd g : could we could we , um we have have in the past and i think continue will continue to have a fair number of uh phone conference calls . professor d : uh - huh . phd g : and , uh , and as a to , um as another c c comparison condition , we could um see what what what happens in terms of overlap , when you do n't have visual contact . grad h : yeah , we talked about this repeatedly . phd g : so , um phd b : can we actually record ? grad h : it just seems like that 's a very different thing than what we 're doing . professor d : uh well , we 'll have to set up for it . phd b : i mean physically can we record the o the other professor d : yeah . well , we 're not really set up for it to do that . but . phd g : or , this is getting a little extravagant , we could put up some kind of blinds or something to to remove , uh visual contact . professor d : yeah . phd c : yeah . grad h : barriers ! phd b : that 's what they did on map task , you know , this map task corpus ? they ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without visual cues and it 's quite interesting . professor d : well , we we record this meeting so regularly it would n't be that i mean a little strange . grad h : ok , we can record , but no one can look at each other . phd b : well , we could just put b blindfolds on . phd c : yeah . phd g : well y no you f grad h : close your eyes . postdoc f : blindf phd g : yeah , yeah . grad h : turn off the lights . phd b : and we 'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds . that would professor d : oh , th that was the other thing , were n't we gon na take a picture at the beginning of each of these meetings ? grad h : um , what i had thought we were gon na do is just take pictures of the whiteboards . rather than take pictures of the meeting . postdoc f : well , linguistic grad h : and , uh postdoc f : yeah . linguistic anthropologists would would suggest it would be useful to also take a picture of the meeting . professor d : there 's a head nodding here vigorously , yeah . phd a : why why do we want to have a picture of the meeting ? phd b : ee - you mean , transc no postdoc f : the because you get then the spatial relationship of the speakers . phd e : yeah yeah . postdoc f : and that could be phd g : well , you could do that by just noting on the enrollment sheet the the seat number . phd e : yeah . grad h : seat number , that 's a good idea . i 'll do that . phd e : yeah . grad h : i 'll do that on the next set of forms . phd e : yeah . phd g : so you 'd number them somehow . phd e : is possible to get information from the rhythmic f from the ge , eh uh , files . grad h : i finally remembered to put , uh put native language on the newer forms . phd a : we can ca n't you figure it out from the mike number ? grad h : the wireless ones . and even the jacks , i mean , i 'm sitting here and the jack is over in front of you . phd b : but probably from these you could 've { comment } infer it . phd g : yeah , but it 's it would be trivial grad h : it would be another task . phd b : it would be a research task . grad h : having having ground tu truth would be nice , so seat number would be good . phd a : you know where you could get it ? phd b : yeah , yeah . phd a : beam - forming during the digit uh stuff . phd e : yeah . grad h : so i 'm gon na put little labels on all the chairs with the seat number . phd c : mm - hmm . grad h : that 's a good idea . phd b : but you have to keep the chairs in the same pla like here . phd g : not the chairs . the chairs are chairs are movable . grad h : but , uh phd g : put them like , put them on the table where they phd e : the chair { comment } yeah . phd c : yeah . postdoc f : but you know , they the s the linguistic anthropologists would say it would be good to have a digital picture anyway , phd a : just remembered a joke . postdoc f : because you get a sense also of posture . posture , and we could like , you know , block out the person 's face or whatever phd g : what people were wearing . grad h : yeah . phd b : the fashion statement . postdoc f : but but , you know , these are important cues , phd g : oh , andreas was phd a : how big their heads are . postdoc f : i mean the the how a person is sitting is professor d : but if you just f but from one picture , i do n't know that you really get that . phd g : yeah . andreas was wearing that same old sweater again . professor d : right ? you 'd want a video for that , i think . postdoc f : it 'd be better than nothing , is is i just from a single picture i think you can tell some aspects . phd e : a video , yeah . professor d : think so ? postdoc f : i mean i i could tell you i mean , if i if i 'm in certain meetings i notice that there are certain people who really do eh the body language is very uh is very interesting in terms of the dominance aspect . phd g : and and yeah . and and morgan had that funny hair again . postdoc f : yeah . { comment } well , i mean you black out the that part . but it 's just , you know , the the body phd a : he agreed . postdoc f : you know ? grad h : of course , the where we sit at the table , i find is very interesting , that we do tend to cong to gravitate to the same place each time . postdoc f : yeah . grad h : and it 's somewhat coincidental . i 'm sitting here so that i can run into the room if the hardware starts , you know , catching fire or something . phd g : oh , no , you you just like to be in charge , that 's why you 're sitting grad h : i just want to be at the head of the table . phd g : yeah . grad h : take control . professor d : speaking of taking control , you said you had some research to talk about ."
