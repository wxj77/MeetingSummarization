    "answer": "ms. marie-hlne gaudreau ( laurentideslabelle , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . my first question is for the prime minister . we 've heard a lot about contact tracing apps . several provinces have already made announcements on this , and others want to follow suit . today , i 'd like to know where the government stands on this . we 've been talking about a national strategy for some time . where are we now ? hon . patty hajdu : thank you , mr . chair . obviously , contact tracing is an important part of managing any outbreak . in fact , we have been looking at a number of ways to support increased contact tracing across the country , including working with provinces and territories to boost their capacity through human resources and volunteer organizations . we are working very closely with them to make sure we have the capacity . the member is right that many other countries have used digital contact tracing apps . anything we put forward as a digital tool to assist with contact tracing would be thoroughly considerate of canadians ' privacy rights . ms. marie-hlne gaudreau : let me clarify my question a little . yes , we are talking about public health , and we are currently experiencing a crisis . but you know as well as i do that the privacy commissioner has been calling us to task for a very long time now , because there is also a crisis of confidence . you know as well as i do that for 90 % of canadians , the misuse of their personal data is a cause for concern , whether it be for profiling or business development purposes . this is an issue that concerns all canadians . the commissioner is indeed calling for a focus on reform of the privacy act . i 'd like to know whether this commitment will be implemented quickly so that legislation can be passed on this issue , in this case the privacy act . hon . navdeep bains : particular attention must be paid to transparency , privacy and ethical concerns . naturally , canadians are concerned about how their data is used . new technologies are subject to the privacy act . ms. marie-hlne gaudreau : we 're talking about public health . the provinces are currently in the process of legislating . we 're talking about what is going on in quebec , among other places , and i would like to make sure that the federal government commits to respecting the proposals regarding geolocation and contact tracing possibilities , with full respect for the right to privacy . can we commit to respecting the provinces ? hon . patty hajdu : thank you , mr . chair . we have worked very closely with provinces and territories for a long time before the outbreak , but certainly ever since the outbreak . we respect the rights of jurisdictional authorities to use tools that have been properly vetted through their own provincial and territorial legislation . nothing we would ever do at the federal level would put canadians ' privacy in jeopardy . ms. marie-hlne gaudreau : concerning privacy , there are 30million quebeckers and canadians who have had their personal data leaked . why is it that our laws do n't allow us to apply financial penalties so that we can then go further ? the very basis is to be concerned about our fundamental rights . the commissioner has been making this request for several years now . as the critic for access to information and privacy , i 'd like a commitment that the federal government will deal not with what the provinces are doing , but with the privacy act . the chair : your time is up , but i 'll give the floor to the minister for 30seconds ."
