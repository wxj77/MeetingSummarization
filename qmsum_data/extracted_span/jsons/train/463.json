    "query": "<s> what does the group think of the extent they 'd like to see the pdg used to track the progress of eligible pupils ?",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . as we 've got a couple of minutes left , if i can just jump back to the issue of practical uses of the pdg\u2014because it 's the only thing we have n't really covered and it would be good to get on the record\u2014can i ask to what extent you 'd like to see the pdg used to track the progress of eligible pupils ? and the committee 's heard that there are several different tracking systems and tools used by schools . to what extent is that an issue to do with what the welsh government is promoting ? or is it down to consortia or individual schools ? and do you think there needs to be a more centralised push on how the tracking is undertaken ? kirsty williams am : firstly , can i say it 's absolutely crucial that we track performance , absolutely crucial ? that 's the bedrock . we do n't dictate to individual schools the nature of the system that they should employ in their school . there are a number of different programmes that allow schools to do this , but we are absolutely clear , and best practice and evidence shows us , that individual pupil tracking is key and crucial . and , as i said in the beginning , where we were n't tracking pupils at all , initial investment in pdg was used to establish these systems within schools . again , one of the outcomes from the schools challenge review , and one of the lessons learnt , was , again , the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career . but we do n't dictate a single system . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . kirsty williams am : but the principle is a really important one . lynne neagle am : okay , and you do n't think there 's more scope to look at what the best system is that can be recommended to schools ."
