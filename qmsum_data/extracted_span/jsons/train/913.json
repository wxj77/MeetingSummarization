    "answer": "phd e : so have the um when is the next uh evaluation ? june or something ? professor b : which ? speaker recognition ? phd e : no , for uh aurora ? professor b : uh there , we do n't know about evaluation , next meeting is in june . and uh uh but like getting get together . phd e : oh , ok . are people supposed to rerun their systems , professor b : nobody said that yet . phd e : or ? professor b : i assume so . uh yes , uh , but nobody even set up yet the date for uh delivering uh endpointed data . phd e : hmm . wow . professor b : and this uh that that sort of stuff . but i uh , yeah , what i think would be of course extremely useful , if we can come to our next meeting and say `` well you know we did get fifty percent improvement . if if you are interested we eventually can tell you how `` , but uh we can get fifty percent improvement . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : because people will s will be saying it 's impossible . phd e : hmm . do you know what the new baseline is ? oh , i guess if you do n't have professor b : twenty - two t twenty twenty - two percent better than the old baseline . phd e : using your uh voice activity detector ? professor b : u yes . yes . but i assume that it will be similar , i do n't i i do n't see the reason why it should n't be . phd e : similar , yeah . professor b : i d i do n't see reason why it should be worse . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : cuz if it is worse , then we will raise the objection , phd e : yeah . professor b : we say `` well you know how come ? `` because eh if we just use our voice activity detector , which we do n't claim even that it 's wonderful , it 's just like one of them . phd c : mm - hmm . phd e : yeah . professor b : we get this sort of improvement , how come that we do n't see it on on on on your endpointed data ? phd c : yeah . i guess it could be even better , professor b : i think so . phd c : because the voice activity detector that i choosed is something that cheating , it 's using the alignment of the speech recognition system , professor b : yeah . c yeah uh phd c : and only the alignment on the clean channel , and then mapped this alignment to the noisy channel . professor b : and on clean speech data . yeah . phd e : oh , ok . professor b : well david told me david told me yesterday or harry actually he told harry from qualcomm and harry uh brought up the suggestion we should still go for fifty percent he says are you aware that your system does only thirty percent uh comparing to to endpointed baselines ? so they must have run already something . phd c : yeah . professor b : so . and harry said `` yeah . but i mean we think that we we did n't say the last word yet , that we have other other things which we can try . `` so . so there 's a lot of discussion now about this uh new criterion . because nokia was objecting , with uh qualcomm 's we basically supported that , we said `` yes `` . phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : now everybody else is saying `` well you guys might must be out of your mind . `` uh the guenter hirsch who d does n't speak for ericsson anymore because he is not with ericsson and ericsson may not may withdraw from the whole aurora activity because they have so many troubles now . ericsson 's laying off twenty percent of people . phd e : where 's uh guenter going ? professor b : well guenter is already he got the job uh already was working on it for past two years or three years phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : he got a job uh at some some fachschule , the technical college not too far from aachen . so it 's like professor u university professor phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : you know , not quite a university , not quite a sort of it 's not aachen university , but it 's a good school and he he 's happy . phd e : mm - hmm . hmm ! professor b : and he well , he was hoping to work uh with ericsson like on t uh like consulting basis , but right now he says says it does n't look like that anybody is even thinking about speech recognition . phd e : mm - hmm . professor b : they think about survival . yeah . so . so . but this is being now discussed right now , and it 's possible that uh that that it may get through , that we will still stick to fifty percent . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : but that means that nobody will probably get this im this improvement . yet , wi with the current system . which event es essentially i think that we should be happy with because that that would mean that at least people may be forced to look into alternative solutions phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : and phd c : mm - hmm . but maybe i i mean we are not too far from from fifty percent , from the new baseline . professor b : uh , but not phd c : which would mean like sixty percent over the current baseline , which is professor b : yeah . yes . yes . we we getting we getting there , right . phd c : well . we are around fifty , fifty - five . professor b : yeah . yeah . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : is it like sort of is how did you come up with this number ? if you improve twenty by twenty percent the c the f the all baselines , it 's just a quick c comp co computation ? phd c : yeah . i do n't know exactly if it 's professor b : uh - huh . i think it 's about right . phd c : yeah , because it de it depends on the weightings professor b : yeah , yeah . phd c : and yeah . but . mm - hmm . phd e : hmm . how 's your documentation or whatever it w what was it you guys were working on last week ? phd c : yeah , finally we we 've not finished with this . we stopped . phd d : more or less it 's finished . phd c : yeah . phd d : ma - nec to need a little more time to improve the english , and maybe s to fill in something some small detail , something like that , phd c : mm - hmm . phd d : but it 's more or less ready . phd c : yeah . well , we have a document that explain a big part of the experiments , phd d : necessary to to include the bi the bibliography . mm - hmm . phd c : it 's not , yeah , finished yet . mm - hmm ."
