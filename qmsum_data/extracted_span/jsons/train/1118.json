    "query": "<s> what views did project manager get from the last meeting review and market research ?",
    "answer": "project manager : alright let 's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . see if i ca n't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . um i 'll go over what we went over last time , which should n't take long . then i believe each of you have a presentation . um i 've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , um and how it 's going to do it hopefully . and uh then we 'll have the closing . um which we 'll have forty minutes for . uh let 's see , the last meeting we went over um who was responsible for what . i 'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . um corinne is our marketing expert . she 's gon na figure out what what um the consumer wants . um ryan is our user interface designer . and manuel is the industrial designer . so you 're gon na come up with the ideas ryan , and you 're gon na pick 'em apart . user interface : project manager : um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want . um we want to be modern , um fun , different . uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gon na have that locator function . um and we want to be different . um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . ball-shaped phone . the keyboard shape . um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . something we could use with one hand . um and that was our last meeting . so um why do n't um do each of you have a presentation ? marketing : another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they 'd do it , but probably a lot of them that 's actually their parents money . like i do n't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know . user interface : i think as well it 'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . user interface : but practically i do n't think it 's project manager : it 's a , it 's a gimmick factor that they like at first , and user interface : yeah . it 'll wear off . project manager : now i was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . um the remote 's only gon na be for the television , which is good because we already decided y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it 's more cost , more costly . and your re uh research showed that you know most of the people do n't even use it . i think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons . so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . um no teletext . um so we do n't have to worry about that . um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . and our corporate colours are grey and yellow . and we could probably get away with black too but so those are the three um the three new requirements that that i was told we need to use . um from all all three of your uh presentations , i think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . we want something that looks good . um we want something that 's simple . we want something that you can find easily . um and the speech recognition i i guess is kind of uh give or take . it 's gon na cost more . s the young the younger people say that they like it . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : i did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . is that if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wan na call it . um that you you should put it back in . your remote . but if you do n't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . just by infrared . that should n't be too complex i would 've thought . project manager : that 'd be , that 'd be good if we were going with our our ball . user interface : yeah it would be quite good . project manager : or or with you know i guess with any form that that would be good . user interface : the ball could sit on a project manager : you know that could be the charger . for you know user interface : yeah . project manager : we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . and that would be or solar . or you know however , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . um user interface : yeah . project manager : with the locator button . um and if it were the ball you 'd no longer have to have a flat space on it . user interface : yeah . project manager : um like industrial designer : you still do . project manager : we still have the how to hold on to it industrial designer : you s you still w yeah . you put it on t on the couch table . project manager : it 's gon na roll away . industrial designer : while you 're watching , marketing : rolls away industrial designer : it 's gon na roll off . so marketing : yeah . industrial designer : that 's not an issue really . project manager : um so i guess after the meeting we 'll have some questionnaires . and uh and some summaries for for what 's going on . um then we 'll take lunch . then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . um i 'll do the minutes . uh let 's see . it looks like you 're already on your way for uh working with the components . um chips , the what chips we need industrial designer : . project manager : and what uh you know how to power it and whatnot . user interface concept , we want it to be something simple . user interface : yeah ."
