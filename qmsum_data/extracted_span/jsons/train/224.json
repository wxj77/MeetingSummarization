    "answer": "janet finch-saunders am : good morning . thank you , chair . good morning , deputy minister . of those individuals who responded to our written consultation in a personal capacity , nearly 70 per cent do not support this bill . we also heard a clear message from the parents we met last week who oppose this bill that , as parents , they understand clearly the difference between child abuse and a light smack from a loving parent . how would you like to respond to that ? julie morgan am : thank you very much , janet , for that question . i think i 'd like to start by saying that child abuse is not the issue that the bill is trying to address . what the bill is trying to do is prohibit all forms of physical punishment , and that is in order to protect children 's rights and to ensure that children have the same protection from physical punishment as adults . but i do understand that people have different views , and that 's why this process has been so important\u2014for us to hear what your views are and what parents ' views are . i know that , often , people use different euphemisms really to make light of physical punishment . i 've heard expressions used such as a 'light smack ' or a 'loving smack ' or a 'tap ' , and really there can be different interpretations of what is a 'light smack ' , what is a 'loving smack ' , and that does n't really cover the issue of the frequency of such actions being taken . but i would say that , however mild it seems to be , the united nations committee on the rights of the child recognises that any physical punishment of children , however minor , is incompatible with their human rights , and why should a big person hit a little person ? that 's been the sort of mantra , really , that has taken me through supporting this legislation\u2014that it just seems wrong to me that there is something in the law that could mean that there could be an excuse for that happening . i believe we should n't have anything in the law that defends the physical punishment of children , and i do n't think we should be defining acceptable ways of hitting or punishing children , because i think it does send a confused message to children . it says , 'it 's okay for me to hit you , but do n't you hit anybody else . ' i think it causes confusion . so , i 'm confident that updating the law will make it much clearer for parents and people working with children\u2014and , of course , i 'm sure , as you 'll have heard from the evidence you 've taken , that people who work with children are overwhelmingly in support of this legislation , and the representative surveys that we 've carried out show support for the bill 's principles . janet finch-saunders am : thank you , deputy minister . last week , during the workshop , a few parents\u2014predominantly all of them , actually\u2014said that they use a gentle tap or smacking as part of a toolkit of ways to deal with challenging behaviour or , sometimes , for the safety of the child or , indeed , to carry out the parenting of a child . how do you intend to work with parents going forward , given the finite resources that social care and social services have ? i know from the responses we 've received to the consultation that parents themselves who have to parent 24 hours a day , seven days a week , they are really , on the scale of things , very upset about this . how do you intend to try and get your message across to those parents on removing what they consider to be part of their toolkit when raising children ? how do you intend to deal with that aspect ? julie morgan am : well , first of all , i want to say , as i 've said in most evidence sessions , that i completely accept that bringing up children is hard . it 's very difficult ; many of us have done it and we know how tough it can be . but we do n't think that there is any place for physical punishment in bringing up children . there 's a whole range of other ways that you can help parents bring up children , and advice you can give them of different methods to use . but , the clear message of this bill is that we do n't want any physical punishment ; we do n't think it 's the right thing to do , and we believe that we are supported by many people in that view . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . lynne neagle am : you 've got other questions , janet . janet finch-saunders am : okay . oh , yes . several consultation responses refer to statistics from sweden , which they say show that child-on-child violence actually increased by 1,791 per cent between 1984 and 2010 , following the ban on physical punishment in 1979 . what is your view on these figures and how can we be certain that this bill wo n't lead to other long-term negative outcomes in wales ? julie morgan am : well , i 'm aware of the debate surrounding the interpretation of the different statistics from sweden . what 's happened , really , in the academic research is that different academics are focused on different figures to support their views , and the methodological ways of doing it makes it quite difficult to have causation . i was very encouraged that a recent study of 88 countries concluded that if a country prohibits corporal punishment , the result is association with less youth violence , and this is one of the largest cross-national analyses of youth violence , with more than 400,000 participants . so , there is other evidence , very widespread evidence , which looks at a whole range of people , that is in contrast to the swedish evidence . but , evidence in this field is mixed and we have considered a wide range of research and reviews , but ultimately the decision is one that is based on our commitment to children 's rights . janet finch-saunders am : okay , thank you . lynne neagle am : do you want question 3 ? janet finch-saunders am : i can do it , yes . the bill 's explanatory memorandum says that 'there is no definitive evidence that `` reasonable '' physical punishment causes negative outcomes for children ' . however , we have heard from equal protection network cymru that international evidence could not be clearer and that they found the wales centre for public policy 's report , on which the explanatory memorandum is based , very confusing and very frustrating , and that it did n't tie in with what they knew . how would you respond to those viewpoints ? julie morgan am : we were very keen to get as balanced research as we possibly could , and we did n't want to just put forward views that we thought agreed with our point of view . so , we were trying to give a balanced point of view , but we did commission the wales centre for public policy to do an independent literature review and we 're honestly reporting to you what they said . but they did make it clear , again , which i think i 've said in previous evidence sessions , that all physical punishment , under all conditions , is potentially harmful to children . and certainly , there is no peer-reviewed research that says that physically punishing a child is going to improve things , has favourable outcomes . so , i understand what equal protection network cymru are saying , because there is a lot of very strong evidence , but we 're giving you the evidence that we had from the research that we commissioned . lynne neagle am : thank you . we 've got some questions now from suzy on implementation . suzy davies am : thank you , chair . i 've just got a couple of questions on this balance between the steps that will be needed to implement this bill and the impact that it 'll actually have . you 've probably heard in evidence that we 've received that there are still some concerns out there about how agencies might address malicious reporting ; some detail about how the public interest test might be applied further along the line ; what 's going to happen with out-of-hours provision from social services , and so on . there are still , from our perspective , quite a few things that are unknown about the effect on our public services in particular of the implementation of this bill . would you agree that perhaps we should know a little bit more about that before we proceed with supporting the bill ? julie morgan am : well , it 's very difficult , bringing in this legislation that has n't been done before . it 's very difficult to gauge the impact , and we 've covered that , i know , in previous discussions . but i think it 's very important to say that we are not creating a new offence . the bill is removing a defence to an offence of common assault . and i think it 's an interesting point to make that , in ireland , they introduced similar legislation through an amendment to a bill , and had no detailed preparation for bringing in the bill , and in fact there 's no evidence that this has caused any difficulties , and no significant negative impacts or increase in workload . but in any case , we have our implementation group , which is going to address many of these issues . this met on 14 may . that was the first meeting . you see , i think we do have to take a balance between assuming this bill is going to go through and what we can actually do . we ca n't presume that the assembly will accept this bill , so we have to be staged in what we do . but we had the first strategic implementation group on 14 may , and we had representatives from the police , the police and crime commissioners , the crown prosecution service , the association of directors of social services cymru , the association of directors of education in wales , the welsh local government association , the legal profession and the third sector . they 're all there , and they 're all very keen to make this legislation work and to look at the implications of it . i 'd just like to say how grateful i am for all those organisations giving their time and commitment . they 've set up four work streams , looking at parenting advice and support ; data collection , evaluation and monitoring ; operations , procedures and processes ; and out-of-court disposals and diversions . these groups will be taking forward this work and will be looking at many of those issues that you 've mentioned , and will also be updated on the progress of the awareness strategy that we will be bringing in . i 'm really confident that the legislation will be implemented in a very practical and workable way , because we do have the commitment of all these agencies , and there 's been a huge amount of preparation done in the welsh government to prepare for this in a way that , i have to say , has n't been done in some of the other countries\u2014as i mentioned , in ireland . so , as much preparation as could be done is being done and has been done , but we really now see that the implementation group is taking forward all these issues , and obviously those agencies that are taking part in the implementation group are , on the whole , in support of the principles of this bill . suzy davies am : well , thank you for that , minister , but the way i look at this is that you 've already said that , if this bill passes\u2014and it will pass ; it 's in enough manifestos to pass , so the question is what type of bill is going to pass\u2014and if there is a gap of , let 's say , two years before anything is implemented , and the implementation group is doing the work that you 've described\u2014and we 're very relieved to hear that\u2014why is this bill being introduced now when that implementation group has n't really come up with a strategy that could help persuade people about what implementing this bill would look like in real life ? you 're asking the welsh public to take a bit of a chance on this . julie morgan am : i think we have , as far as possible , looked at international evidence where this legislation has been introduced . it 's different for different countries , so i know it 's difficult to get anything that 's absolutely linked . but i do n't agree that it 's a bit of a chance , really . i think we are preparing very well and very carefully . as the team who have been working on this have worked through the preparation for the bill , lots of issues have arisen as they 've done that , and so you have to do that , i think , alongside the actual practical implications with the groups that are coming together , and i think the point at which we 've done that is probably just about right , really . suzy davies am : okay . i hope this is n't going on to somebody else 's questions , but accepting what you say , would you then be open to accepting amendments to the face of the bill that would clarify the position for the welsh public on certain things that may be of concern to them , which have been fed through to us ? i 'm not suggesting anything specific , but\u2014 . julie morgan am : no , no . i mean , the position is that it is a very simple , one-clause bill . we want to keep it as simple as possible , but i 'm certainly prepared to consider any issues that come up , and i think that 's been the case all along . although our preference is to keep it simple . suzy davies am : i understand that . it 's just what 's going to work as a bit of law here , is n't it ? and then just finally from me , and you 've made the point to a degree , that , of course , not all countries are like wales . if we look at ireland , and new zealand 's the one we 've been looking at an awful lot , which are the most similar , their work has n't really been in place for that long , and one of the things that , i think , you 're going to need to be able persuade us of is that if the culture change to which we 've already referred is going in one way anyway , and if it continues to go in that direction , that this bill will have had a causal effect . i 'm trying to establish whether the culture change is going to happen anyway , whether or not we pass this legislation . julie morgan am : well , it does look as if a culture change is happening in any case , but the culture change will never really move , i think , as most of us want it , if there is legislation that does appear to condone the use of physical punishment , and having this reasonable punishment in law means that happens . so , i think , passing the legislation by itself will certainly not do everything\u2014 suzy davies am : no . and you 'll be aware that this is to go with it . i get that , but\u2014 julie morgan am : you 've got to have\u2014 . and i think the research has all shown you 've got to have an awareness campaign running along with it . that is shown . and in the other countries we 've looked at , i do n't think an awareness campaign was actually carried out because we are planning a really big awareness campaign because we think it 's absolutely fair to the welsh public , as you said , that they absolutely know what we 're doing and everybody 's aware of it . so , i think it is\u2014 . suzy davies am : okay . well , can i just finish\u2014 ? julie morgan am : i know the point you 're making . you 're saying that this would happen in any case , maybe . suzy davies am : i 'm suggesting it . julie morgan am : but if you 've got a bit of legislation there on the bill , it will always mean that for a very minority group of parents , they will feel that they have got the right to use physical punishment against their child , and i just think it 's something we should get rid of . i think it 's an anachronism and it 's something we should\u2014 . and i think wales has been very strong on children 's rights . we 've got rid of physical punishment in schools , child minders , regulated care settings . and , of course , the other point that i do n't think we say enough about is that it 's not just parents ; it 's people in loco parentis who are working in leisure centres or religious establishments or any of those unregulated settings who also have this defence . so , it 's last bit in the jigsaw , really , to have it quite clear that we want to treat our children with respect and dignity and i think this will move us towards that . suzy davies am : okay . well , it 's the argument you 've made before . i think what i was trying to get to is : how are we going to prove that this piece of legislation has worked effectively ? it 's about the data capture , i guess . what are you going to do to make sure that you acquire evidence in the future to show that this has worked , or potentially not worked ? i 'd be surprised if that was the case , but\u2014 . because , of course , that has an implication then on the resources for the various people you 'll be asking to collect the data . julie morgan am : yes . i think that 's very important because we need to know what is the effect of the legislation we 'll be bringing in . so , we will be having ongoing evaluation , we will be bringing in an independent body to evaluate . we have got ongoing monitoring and we 've got ongoing monitoring surveys looking at what are the views of the public . so , yes\u2014 suzy davies am : it 'll be directly linked to the bill , then , rather than that broad culture change . julie morgan am : the monitoring , asking the views of the public , is generally about issues related to the bill . the views of parents about whether this legislation\u2014 suzy davies am : sorry , i do n't want to labour this point . julie morgan am : and awareness . how aware they are . suzy davies am : basically , we need a question , 'has this bill stopped you smacking your child ? ' that 's the core question . so , phrase it differently , yes ? julie morgan am : yes . well , we are in the surveys asking how many people feel that they do smack their child , but this is any physical punishment , actually , not just smacking\u2014 suzy davies am : and it 's for the future , not for now . julie morgan am : \u2014and how many , actually , are doing that . and it is consistently going down , as you said ."
