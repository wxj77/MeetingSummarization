    "query": "<s> what 's their opinion about the risk of losing focus ?",
    "answer": "sian gwenllian am : what i was going to raise has been answered already , that is that , from what i can see , the work that professor dylan jones is doing has evolved somewhat . i felt that , originally , the idea was to look at the middle tier in terms of any kind of duplication that was happening , and where it was possible to tighten up the people going into schools from different directions . but it appears that it has evolved to be something that 's much more than that , and that it is placing a focus on the curriculum and other aspects of the educational system . is there a risk for them to lose focus in that sense ? kirsty williams am : no , not at all . i think they are very , very clear around establishing roles and responsibilities for each of the players and to be very clear about the expectations that each part of the middle tier can have of each other , as to what they can expect from their partners in the middle tier . and absolutely , it is about making sure that there is n't duplication , that people are n't second-guessing each other 's work , and there are clear demarcations about who does what in the system , and , as i said , knowing that you can rely on your colleague in the middle tier to do the bit that they are responsible for . so , i do n't think there 's a question of it losing focus ."
