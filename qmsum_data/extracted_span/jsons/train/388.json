    "answer": "lynne neagle am : thank you . we 've got some questions now from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : thank you , chair . delivery of the plan will be led by a national implementation board that will be accountable to ministers . which minister do you believe it should be accountable to , or , given the complexity of obesity , should the board be directly accountable to the first minister ? dr frank atherton : ultimately , the first minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this . it is often framed as a health issue , and the minister , vaughan gething , has a strong personal commitment to this , i know . we 've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that , so there 's a link there . it does cut across all portfolios , and so this is an issue that i have discussed with cabinet , and that collective ownership is really important , and will be , because it ca n't just sit in one domain . i think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry , and i would see health as\u2014i work within health , so i 'm perhaps biased , but i would see health as leading this , but it needs broad ownership across government . janet finch-saunders am : i know my colleague si\u00e2n gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things , but i know in wales we 're not too good at collecting data . what data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan 's objectives ? dr frank atherton : well , of course , our main data source is the child measurement programme , which collects information on children entering school aged four or five . that 's our main source of information . if we look at that data , it shows us\u2014 . well , i 'm sure you 're familiar with the statistics , but it 'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : could i just ask\u2014sorry to interrupt\u2014how up to date is that ? dr frank atherton : the last survey was just last year . nathan cook : the data was published last week . dr frank atherton : yes , the lastest data was out last week . janet finch-saunders am : it is pretty up to date . dr frank atherton : so , it 's pretty up to date , and what it shows\u2014 . it 's not getting radically worse\u2014there 's always statistical variation in these things\u2014but it 's not getting any better . and , for the first time last year , we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese , but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese , severely obese . so we have a figure for that for the first time , which is about 12 per cent , which is quite shocking , in a way . janet finch-saunders am : it is shocking . dr frank atherton : so , that 's our main source of information . does that answer your question ? janet finch-saunders am : yes , but how will any gaps in your data be addressed ? dr frank atherton : well , one of the questions that are often asked is : could we measure more on a longitudinal basis ? by that i mean in england , for example , children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12. , that kind of age group . and so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what 's happening to children . i think that would be helpful to us in wales , and it 's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that . obviously , that would have significant resource implications , not just for the funding , but also for schools and for the system to deliver it . but it 's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier . nathan cook : and the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study , which has been released , for 14 and 15-year-olds . that 's going to be\u2014 . we 're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data , looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well , which will be really helpful . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . you 've answered my next question . thank you . lynne neagle am : can i just ask about the child measurement programme ? the strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in wales . can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data ?"
