    "answer": "industrial designer : okay , um i wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . it 's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . um well so it basically works uh as i uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . uh when you press a button , uh that 's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a project manager : sorry . user interface : industrial designer : on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh gives the chips , uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . uh senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . um uh the the chip uh makes a morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let . you know what a let is ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . and that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . that 's basically uh how it works . um the findings uh uh that i found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it 's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh and chips . user interface : industrial designer : uh and the technology 's already available , we do n't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals . uh i made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works . user interface : oh right . marketing : animation . user interface : industrial designer : we tel user interface : there is something turning . industrial designer : there . project manager : yeah , it 's a little bug it 's in the in the smart board . industrial designer : okay . uh well user interface : industrial designer : the sub-component , i suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it 's the button . uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh li uh a d ad uh electronic uh user interface : marketing : infrared light . industrial designer : yes , uh , okay . um w after it 's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set . okay . s uh i wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you do n't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it 's it 's very light to uh to make uh to use it . uh i personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . but i suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . user interface : yeah , i 've got it there too . industrial designer : and it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , marketing : industrial designer : uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . and uh well as i said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . user interface : yeah ."
