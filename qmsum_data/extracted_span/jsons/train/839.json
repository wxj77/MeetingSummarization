    "answer": "user interface : and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes . project manager : with with mm-hmm . industrial designer : we can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know . project manager : well that 's that 's user interface : but in a family in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they can not buy three different remotes . industrial designer : yeah . children and everybody , yeah . user interface : they would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh industrial designer : yeah of course that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you ca n't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know . marketing : what about the electronics ? that 's not really gon na change much , is it ? project manager : yeah . user interface : cost effective . industrial designer : no , it it does n't cost , yeah . project manager : no marketing : that that w that wo n't change much , will it uh ? industrial designer : yeah . does n't does n't does n't matter . project manager : the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , marketing : i d i would n't think so . project manager : and i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . project manager : the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . i mean the basic design i understand will be the same , marketing : yeah . project manager : but the question is how much will that set us back if let 's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : so that remains to s to be seen but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a tv . marketing : that 's right , and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? project manager : yeah , well that 's that 's the question . marketing : um the same electronics and basically all that 's gon na be different is the plastic case . industrial designer : hmm hmm . marketing : and in that case we could probabl moulded plastic is n't all that expensive is it ? industrial designer : uh no . mm , i i i do n't think no . it 's not . marketing : um you as an industrial person ? project manager : well maybe there 's there 's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ? marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : but uh yeah i i have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people . project manager : well i think i think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote industrial designer : yeah , but uh marketing : well i think we can only aff , yeah . user interface : okay . project manager : and what the only change is gon na be um industrial designer : yeah . project manager : the funct d t yeah uh marketing : cosmetic . user interface : of th okay . project manager : the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , user interface : okay . project manager : um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : five minutes that was i guess tha that 's the old message . marketing : warning , finish meeting now . project manager : finish meeting now . um um . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um industrial designer : yeah , maybe , yeah , yeah . project manager : but i think industrial designer : if we do some more research , maybe we . project manager : i i think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody . if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that . user interface : okay , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : hmm yeah , project manager : do we agree , do we ? industrial designer : i think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it 's sort of like yeah . marketing : okay but we have to l project manager : do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not ."
