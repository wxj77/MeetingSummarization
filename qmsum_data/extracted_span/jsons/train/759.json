    "query": "<s> what do the group think of the existing problem of erasmus and the mobility funding for students ?",
    "answer": "llyr gruffydd am : yes , thank you . we had evidence last week from some of the higher education institutions , including cardiff university , and it 's very interesting , in relation to erasmus+ and the mobility funding for students that , i think , only 40 per cent of the mobility funding in cardiff is paid for by erasmus+ . i note that you 've been consulting on national measures for higher education performance and that one possibility is using international mobility as a performance indicator . i was just wondering whether you might go further and expect universities to actually make commitments to funding international mobility from their own fee incomes as part of that . bethan owen : again , reflecting on the latest fee and access plans , seven of the universities are referring to mobility\u2014either they have targets in them or are explaining what their plans are\u2014so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income . however , erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan\u2014if we were looking at a scenario where that infrastructure was n't available , to implement anything similar to that would be much less efficient and much more costly . and to enable an infrastructure that allowed\u2014 . ideally , you 'd want something that all welsh institutions could take part in , and that takes some investment and some co-ordinating . and , equally , you need to have the arrangements with your overseas and european institutions . i think it 's easy to underestimate the accumulation of time that has gone into establishing erasmus . so , i think replacing it would be a challenge ."
