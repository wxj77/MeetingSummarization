    "answer": "ms. marilyn gladu : very good , mr . chair . my riding is on the border of canada and the u.s. we see a number of inconsistencies in what is considered essential travel with regard to the u.s. and actually in the interpretation of different cbsa agents . while we have americans coming over to buy cheaper prescription medications and to fish , individuals in my riding who are trying to get auditors over so that they can be approved for export businesses are being declined . we have people who have purchased masts from canadian producers for their boats , and who want to come and pick them up , who are not being allowed to do that . people trying to sell plasma into the u.s. are being denied . when will they clarify the rules to the cbsa agents so that essential travel and trade and commerce , including individual commerce , is understood ? hon . bill blair ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) : mr . chair , we have implemented very rigorous rules that have been well documented and understood by cbsa to stop all non-essential travel . those measures have been very successful . we 've seen a 99 % reduction in international travel coming into canada . at the same time , we recognize the importance of maintaining essential supply routes so that goods and services could reach canada and we could put groceries on our shelves . we also recognize the important work that essential workers do on both sides of the border . we have provided cbsa with clarification . their interpretation of those rules has been broadly consistent . i 've heard from a number of our colleagues in caucus with concerns about individual cases . when we receive those inquiries , we follow up immediately . i want to assure the member that we 'll continue to do that . the work we are doing to stop non-essential travel has been important for the health and safety of canadians , and we will continue with that work . ms. marilyn gladu : mr . chair , my next question has to do with sole proprietor businesses . we see that many of them are not eligible for any of the benefit packages that have been rolled outei , cerb , the wage subsidy , etc . what is the government going to do to address sole proprietors who are currently falling through the cracks ? hon . bill morneau ( minister of finance ) : mr . chair , first , let me say that we absolutely recognize there are businesses across the country of all sizes that are finding this to be extremely difficult . the intent of the measures we put forward is obviously not only to give individuals a bridge but to give businesses a bridge . we are looking at ways that we can ensure that the canada emergency business account has the broadest possible application . more than 500,000 businesses have already been approved for these loans , representing over $ 20 billion . we are looking at ways we can consider that eligibility process , recognizing that we need to make sure that the program continues to have its desired impact , and we will have more to say on that . the chair : the next question will go to mr. arnold . mr. mel arnold ( north okanaganshuswap , cpc ) : mr . chair , this is my first appearance , so i hope you can hear me okay . the chair : we can hear you fine . please proceed . mr. mel arnold : thank you , mr . chair . it 's good to see everyone 's faces . on april 3 , the fisheries minister said opening dates would be determined by harvesters . since then the minister has overruled the will of harvesters in prince edward island and in the gulf who voted to start their seasons on time , but she has allowed harvesters from her own riding to proceed with their seasons as scheduled , giving them access to markets weeks before their competitors . this double standard is severely unfair and atlantic harvesters are furious , as demonstrated during the protests on the canso causeway yesterday . when will the minister stop abusing her position and start respecting fish harvesters by opening up lobster fishing areas 23 , 24 and 26 ? hon . bernadette jordan ( minister of fisheries , oceans and the canadian coast guard ) : mr . chair , when making decisions with regard to when seasons open , a number of factors are taken into account . they are complex decisions that take into account what is necessary for processors to be ready for the season , what is necessary for harvesters to be ready for the season , as well socio-economic impacts on the area . we 're looking at all of those measures when we make these decisions . we do not make them lightly . they are difficult decisions to make . in the decisions we 've made around the gulf , one of the main things we heard from all of those areas is that it was very important for them to start on the same date . that is why the decision was made to start on the 15th of may . we 're looking forward to seeing the harvesters out on the water . we 're looking forward to the product that they bring in . we 'll continue do everything we can to support the industry . mr. mel arnold : thank you , minister . i believe the time the chair : excuse me . no , the hon . minister had another 15 seconds coming to her . i 'd like to remind hon . members not to interrupt a person while they are speaking . i 'll do my best to try to keep it about level . maybe i 'll start muting if it 's necessary , but interrupting is not going to solve anything . mr. arnold , i 'll let you continue . you have three minutes and nine seconds left . mr. mel arnold : thank you , mr . chair . west coast fishing tourism is a key economic driver in british columbia , especially in coastal communities , and yet the public fishery gets no respect from the government . last year , the public fishery was weakened by restrictions based on ideology and not science . a year later , the fisheries minister refuses even to discuss viable , science-based solutions to conserve b.c . 's public fisheries . does the minister and her government have a will and a plan to support canada 's west coast fisheries and the communities they sustain ? the chair : the hon . minister in 30 seconds , please . hon . bernadette jordan : mr . chair , the fishery is important in every coastal community . i recognize its value for our economy , as well as what it means to our coastal communities . that 's why we continue to work with those communities and with the fisheries to make sure that we 're doing everything we possibly can to support them . during these extremely difficult times , we 're working on measures with the fishery in b.c. , as well as on the atlantic coast and eastern quebec , to make sure that we 're delivering for them and that all of the issues they 're having are being addressed . the chair : mr. arnold . mr. mel arnold : mr . chair , canada 's seniors , especially those on basic incomes , are being hard hit by the covid-19 crisis as they face new rising costs and scarcity of services . seniors require adequate caregiver supports , physical safety and freedom to access their savings to reinforce their financial security . why has the government failed to recognize the increasing challenges that seniors are facing ? will the government support canada 's senior citizens ? the chair : the hon . minister in 30 seconds or less , please . hon . bernadette jordan : mr . chair , i want to assure my hon . colleague that the government has been focused on seniors during this challenging time . we have provided a gst credit supplement of $ 400 for single seniors and $ 600 for couples , for low- and modest-income seniors . we have also ensured that the canada emergency response benefit is there for seniors who have lost income due to covid-19 . we 've made them eligible . the chair : we 'll go back to mr. arnold . mr. arnold , you have a minutehopefully a 30-second question and a 30-second answer . mr. mel arnold : thank you , mr . chair . on april 23 , my colleagues and i called on the government to create a program that would match students seeking employment with employers in canada 's essential food supply chains . what has the government done to match students and other canadians seeking employment with employers in the agriculture and agri-food sectors , including those in the fish and seafood sector ? hon . carla qualtrough ( minister of employment , workforce development and disability inclusion ) : mr . chair , we 're doing all we can to make sure , using our existing employment programs , that we create opportunities for students to work and get work experience this summer . we know that this is going to be really tough , especially in areas like agriculture , so we have dedicated streams for agriculture sector employers to access students with help from the government , and a number of different initiatives including canada summer jobs , which i 'm really excited to see the results of in the coming days . ms. rachael harder : thank you . now i understand the prime minister has his food prepared for him at 24 sussex drive and then it 's delivered to him at the cottage where he lives . contrary to his privileged understanding , food actually originates with farmers . now , they 're in a crisis right now , which means that regular canadians are actually at risk of not having food available for them at the grocery stores where they purchase theirs . the canadian federation of agriculture requested $ 2.6 billion to help them out . today , the government announced one-tenth of this amount . why does n't the prime minister care about the women and the men who work incredibly hard to keep canada fed ? hon . chrystia freeland ( deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs ) : mr . chair , let me assure the hon . member that our government cares very , very much about the women and men who work so hard to feed our country . let me just say i am grateful to all the farmers , like my dad , who are out in their fields right now getting ready for seeding . we , as canadians , are lucky to be citizens of an agricultural superpower , and our government believes in supporting our farmers and ranchers . ms. rachael harder : i 'm confused as to why the prime minister did n't take my question , and at a bare minimum as to why the agriculture minister does n't feel it 's important enough for her to be a part of this discussion today . when we have farmers who produce for canadians on a daily basis and they 're asking some serious and some very important questions , and we do n't even have a minister who 's willing to come to the table and engage in this conversation , that 's shameful . several meat-packing plants have been forced to shut down because of covid-19 and , as a result , farmers are forced to hold stock longer than expected . cattle producers in my region are spending more than $ 60,000 a day to keep their livestock fed while they wait for processing plants to reopen . the amount that was announced today by the federal government is a drop in the bucket . it 's a crumb . when will the government take this seriously and at least implement a set-aside program for those who are beef producers in canada ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , let me just say that i feel there is nothing shameful at all in having me , the deputy prime minister , answer questions about agriculture . i am actually very proud to speak up for canada 's amazing farmers , for our country 's amazing ranchers , for our amazing pork producers and our poultry producers . i feel so close to our farmers . i love them and our government supports them . today , we announced $ 252 million of support for our producers . they need it . they deserve it . we 're here for them . mr. churence rogers ( bonavistaburintrinity , lib . ) : mr . chair , i 'm sharing my time slot with the member for surreynewton . in the wake of covid-19 , so many canadians have been affected in so many ways . financial loss and other burdens are having a huge impact on families across our country . i 'm proud of how the government of canada has been beside canadians through every step of this pandemic and has supported canadians when they needed it most . in bonavistaburintrinity and across our country , our commercial fishery has seen many challenges and impacts . last week , my colleague , the minister of fisheries and oceans , announced an investment that will ensure resilience of the food system by allowing canada 's fish and seafood processing sector to safely and efficiently process , store , package and distribute healthy , high-quality products on to the plates of canadians . the fish harvesters in my riding are fearful of what will happen within this industry and their immediate futures . they are facing a reduction in available markets and market prices . they are asking what our government is putting in place to assist in these extremely challenging times . when can we expect to hear an answer to our harvesters ' requests for assistance ? hon . bernadette jordan : mr . chair , i want to thank my colleague from bonavistaburintrinity for keeping us well aware of what 's happening in his riding with harvesters and with processors . we know how important the fish and seafood sector is to our rural communities , our coastal communities . it 's the backbone and the lifeblood of our communities and that 's why we want to be there to support them . we 've already taken steps by making sure that the cerb is now able to be accessed by people who are seasonal workers . as well , we are making sure that people who are running out of fishers ei are also able to qualify for it . we also have made an investment of $ 62.5 million to support our processors to make sure they are able to be ready for the challenges that they are going to face because of covid-19 . we know there is more to do . we know that the harvesters need support . we are working with our partners across industry to make sure we 're hearing what their major concerns are . we know they are going to have some very challenging times this season . we will have more to say about that and what we will be able to do in the coming days . the chair : the next questioner is mr. dhaliwal . mr. sukh dhaliwal ( surreynewton , lib . ) : mr . chair , in my riding of surreynewton , i 'm in close contact with businesses that represent all the chair : we have a point of order . mr. kurek . mr. damien kurek ( battle rivercrowfoot , cpc ) : sorry , but there seems to be an issue with the audio . i 'm unable to hear the honourable member . the chair : it is very faint . mr. dhaliwal , can you check your audio to make sure everything 's working well ? mr. sukh dhaliwal : it was the chair : there we go . it 's fine now . i think what happened was the boom had fallen down and it was n't being picked up . there you go . very good . mr. sukh dhaliwal : mr . chair , in my riding of surreynewton , i 'm in close contact with businesses that represent all vantage points in the supply chainfrom manufacturers to retailers , transport companies to warehousing . with provinces and territories moving at different speeds and implementing different protocols for reopening the economy , there is a lot of confusion in my local business community on the timing and logistics of how this will happen . with so many different parts of the supply chain operating in different jurisdictions , and with each business serving unique roles on this spectrum , how can the federal government serve to best coordinate with the provinces and territories so that the supply chain can be implemented smoothly as we embark on our economic recovery ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , i 'd like to thank my colleague for his question and for his hard work . one of the most important things the federal government can do when it comes to the reopening of the canadian economy is to work in close collaboration with the premiers of the provinces and territories . that 's why i was so pleased that last week the prime minister , together with all the first ministers of the country , was able to issue a statement around the principles that will be guiding our entire country as we move towards a restart . this is so important because , as my colleague has pointed out , all of our business , our economic activity , happens across the country . it happens across provincial and territorial boundaries . i would really also like to take this opportunity to thank the first ministers across the country . they belong to different parties , but everyone has really been able to put partisanship aside . we have been able to work together in fighting coronavirus , and we are going to work together in the future to keep on fighting coronavirus and to reopen canada . thank you . the chair : the next question goes to ms. mcpherson . ms. heather mcpherson ( edmonton strathcona , ndp ) : thank you , mr . chair , for the opportunity to represent my constituents virtually during this challenging period of physical distancing . i 'd like to start by asking about supports for workers . in alberta , meat-packing plants are directly responsible for nearly a quarter of all covid-19 cases . the government and management ignored the pleas of workers and did not put effective safety protocols in place to deal with covid-19 . now , two workers are dead , at least six more are in intensive care and covid-19 is spreading like wildfire through these communities . there are over 1,400 cases . yesterday , employees were forced back to work even though their concerns had not been addressed . on march 27 , regarding the cerb , the minister of finance said that if workers do n't feel comfortable in their work , if they decide to stay home , they can apply for the benefit , yet the website says differently . will the minister guarantee that every canadian receiving cerb , ei or the cesb will not lose their benefits if they refuse to return to work or to accept work that is unsafe due to covid-19 ? hon . chrystia freeland : let me thank the member , first of all , for her really very important question . i think all of us share the concern for canada 's essential workers who are keeping us safe , putting food on our tables and often working in difficult conditions . when it comes to the cargill plant , this is an issue that our government has been very closely engaged in . my colleague , the minister of agriculture , has spoken with her provincial counterpart and the head of the plant . the decisions about suspending and reopening are taken by local and provincial health authorities . to the question my colleague asked about workers , it is absolutely the case that no canadian should feel they need to work in an environment that is unsafe , and it is also very much the case that any canadian who is feeling unwell should stay at home . this is the way that collectively we take care of ourselves and we take care the chair : we will go on to ms. mcpherson for the next question . ms. heather mcpherson : i just want to be clear , because i 'm not a hundred per cent sure that i got an answer in that response , so i 'll try one more time . knowing that workers have a fundamental right to refuse unsafe work , can the minister confirm one hundred per cent that if workers refuse unsafe work , they will be able to access the cerb , or was the minister of finance incorrect when he spoke on march 27 ? the chair : the honourable minister . hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm sorry , but i was struggling with my mute button . i apologize . let me just be very clear . no canadian worker at any time should feel obliged to go to work in unsafe conditions . ms. heather mcpherson : but then could they access the cerb ? hon . chrystia freeland : in a time of coronavirus that is even more the case , and the government of course should not penalize workers for doing the right thing and declining to go to work in unsafe conditions . the chair : i want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the chair to avoid back and forth , just to try to keep some order in the meeting . ms. mcpherson , please continue . ms. heather mcpherson : i 'm sorry , chair . i have another question on the protection for workers . at the meat-packing plant , workers are calling for the plant to be shut down . in fact , we know that 85 % of workers are afraid for their safety . if the provincial government wo n't shut down the plant , will the federal government shut down unsafe plants through the canadian food inspection agency ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , on the canadian food inspection agency , let me be very clear that my colleague , the minister of agriculture , has been in touch with provincial authorities . she has been in touch with the plant . the duties of the food inspection agency , of course , are to ensure that the food produced at the plant is safe . that is what inspectors are trained to do and what they are focused on . we are working closely with provincial authorities and with health authorities to ensure that the chair : we will go back to ms. mcpherson . ms. heather mcpherson : mr . chair , this will be one of my final questions on the meat-packing plant in alberta . can the finance minister please let us know if cargill , a company that is owned by billionaires , with business in luxembourg , a known tax haven , has received any federal funding this year for covid-related support ? hon . diane lebouthillier : this is a tough time for canadians , and our government is doing everything it can to support them . more than 7million canadians have applied for the canada emergency response benefit , which the canada revenue agency and service canada administer . i want to say how proud i am of the work the agency is doing ; staff worked tirelessly to get the program up and running in record time . ministerqualtrough is responsible for developing the eligibility criteria and processing the claims . the chair : we are moving on to the next question . we 'll continue now with mr. bragdon . mr. richard bragdon ( tobiquemactaquac , cpc ) : thank you , mr . chair . my question today is for the prime minister . potato farmers in new brunswick and across canada are sitting on massive stores of potatoes that were destined for the restaurant industry , but due to the pandemic , they now have no customers . it 's estimated that there is $ 300 million worth of potatoes still sitting in storage . what is the prime minister 's plan for the helping farmers offload these potatoes so that they are ready for the 2020 season ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , i think all of us as canadians are proud of the great potato farmers across the country . we are aware that the coronavirus , by keeping us away from restaurants where we eat french fries , has had a profound effect on the market for potatoes . the program announced today by the prime minister and my colleague , the minister of agriculture , will be very helpful for potato farmers , including with the surplus food program that starts with a $ 50 million fund , and that the chair : we 'll go back to mr. bragdon now . mr. richard bragdon : mr . chair , thank you . with an estimated $ 300 million worth of potatoes in storage , the announced funding from the government today simply does n't go far enough . in 2018 the new brunswick potato industry lost over $ 20 million . it is estimated this year that the financial loss will exceed $ 40 million . for many producers still recovering from the hit they took in 2018 , another major loss is totally unacceptable . how does the prime minister plan to mitigate these shortfalls and allow farmers to continue to grow the food we so desperately need ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , the honourable member spoke about farmers generally . the program today is $ 252 million , which comes on top of the broad range of other programs that farmers , of course , have access to . on potato farmers , in particular , i agree with the honourable member that this is a specific area of concern . i think all canadians would like to see those potatoes not be wasted but be used , and that 's why the $ 50 million for surplus food purchase is going to be so helpful . mr. richard bragdon : mr . chair , farmers across all agricultural sectors are hurting during this pandemic . the $ 16-billion beef industry is expected to take a massive hit due to the closures and reduced production of the meat-packing plants . does the government truly believe that the announced $ 125 million that is shared between beef , poultry and pork producers will be enough to support these multi-billion dollar industries so they can put food on the tables of canadians ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , i absolutely agree with the honourable member that our beef , pork and poultry producers are absolutely essential for our country . i am very pleased as a canadian that we have security that comes from being a country that produces not only enough food for ourselves , but also enough food to feed the world . that is why the $ 125 million specifically to support our beef , pork and poultry producers is going to be so helpful . mr. richard bragdon : mr . chair , the government 's announcement of $ 252 million for the agriculture sector falls well short of the canadian federation of agriculture 's request for immediate government relief for farmers . the president of the canadian federation of agriculture , mary robinson , put it today something like this : that if the farmhouse is on fire , the government has offered the equivalent of a bucket of water . this will not go nearly far enough to help those in a desperate situation . does the government have a plan to offer more than just crumbs to keep the vital agriculture sector operating and providing the food we so desperately need ? when will the government finally make those who literally keep our land and grow our food a priority in this time of crisis ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , i do n't know about the honourable member , but where i come from , $ 252 million is not just crumbs . i know that canadian farmers do n't feel that $ 252 million is nothing , either . i would like to take this opportunity to highlight two other aspects of the essential support for farmers that we announced today : the $ 77 million to support food processors , which will not only be important for the processors , but helpful for the farmers who produce products that go to them ; and the $ 250 million that we would like to add to the canadian dairy commission 's line of credit to raise it to half a billion dollars , which will be very helpful to our essential dairy farmers . the chair : now we 'll go to the next question . go ahead , mrs. wagantall . mrs. cathay wagantall ( yorktonmelville , cpc ) : mr . chair , a couple in my riding has had to shut down their business , and they are on cerb . they were shocked when their 16-year-old son also qualified , and he is receiving $ 8,000 on the basis of part-time work throughout the school year . why is the government handing out a windfall to teenagers who are living at home while denying university students and ignoring seniors on fixed incomes ? hon . carla qualtrough : mr . chair , any individual who has lost work for covid reasons is eligible for the cerb , regardless of their personal circumstances . if you made $ 5,000 in the past year and are a resident of canada , you qualify for the cerb . this is not a matter of differentiating between the personal circumstances of individuals but of acknowledging that many workers in different situations have lost their work or have had their work significantly reduced because of covid . mrs. cathay wagantall : clearly , high school students would not have the same needs as university students and our seniors who are suffering at this time . the government 's own findings on banning handguns and assault firearms state , in all cases the data does not conclusively demonstrate that these handgun or assault weapon bans have led to reductions in gun violence . why is the prime minister so bent on penalizing law-abiding firearms owners when he should be focusing on funding our cbsa officers first , giving them the resources they need to seize smuggled firearms at our borders ? hon . bill blair : mr . chair , i note with some interest that when we brought forward legislation in a budget in the last two years to increase the number of officers at the border , the member opposite voted against it . i 'm very pleased to hear that she now supports it . let us be very clear . the evidence is overwhelming that these weapons are designed to be used , and have been used , to kill innocent people . countries that adopt sensible gun policiesplaces like new zealand , australia , the united kingdomhave all recognized that there 's no place for these weapons in a civil society . we promised canadians that we would act on that concern . there have been far too many people killed with these weapons , and even most recently , to honour and respect the terrible tragedy in nova scotia , the time to act is now , and we 've acted . mrs. cathay wagantall : last week the minister of agriculture said , step by step we are giving our farmers ... the tools they need to continue their ... work . on april 30 , the canadian federation of agriculture called on the minister to create a $ 2.6-billion fund to maintain food security in canada . this morning , the prime minister announced $ 252 million , hit-and-miss , across the agriculture sector . with all due respect , this is a slap in the face to our farmers and the agri-food sector . instead of being here to speak to this announcement , the minister has chosen to do a press conference . this certainly reveals how seriously the minister takes this virtual sitting and parliamentary accountability . if the deputy minister is going to answer the question in her place , how does she see it is right to be providing $ 9 billion to students and only crumbs to our agriculture sector ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , first of all , let me say i do not , as has now been suggested by two members opposite , consider it in any way shameful that i should be answering questions about our support for the agricultural sector . our government strongly supports our farmers . i have to say i personally very strongly support our farmers and have a strong personal connection to them . the $ 252 million of support is real and meaningful , and it is directed exactly where it is needed . it is directed at food processors , beef and pork producers and the dairy sector . as to the question about students , let me just point out that farm kids are students too , and farm kids will be benefiting from the support for students . i know they , their parents and grandparents are very mrs. cathay wagantall : time is up . the chair : mr.lehoux , the next question goes to you . mr. richard lehoux ( beauce , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . meat packing plants like quebec-based olymel are extremely worried that they wo n't be able to stay open throughout the pandemic . in the summer , these plants rely on students to do overtime and fill in for full-time employees on vacation . however , the canada emergency student benefit makes it possible for these much-needed workers to stay home while still collecting the same amount of money . that 's why the government must adjust its current summer job program for students in the agriculture and agri-food sectors . when is the government going to make these critical changes ? hon . carla qualtrough : i can assure you that we are doing our best efforts to not disincentivize work . we know we need to support students with income support , but we also need to create jobs . we are looking at ways we can create additional jobs through canada summer jobs , through the the chair : there is a point of order . mrs. claude debellefeuille ( salaberrysurot , bq ) : mr.chair , what the minister is saying is not being interpreted . the chair : we 'll just check to see how the technology is going . is everything okay now ? mrs. claude debellefeuille : yes , it 's working . the chair : let 's try that again , minister . hon . carla qualtrough : last week , as part of the measures announced around supporting our students , we announced the creation of 76,000 additional jobs , including jobs in the agriculture and processing sectors . we know we need to work directly with employers to ensure they have the people they need . this is exactly what we 're doing through our youth employment and skills strategy , and that 's what we 'll continue to do . we wo n't apologize for supporting students with income support in these difficult times . mr. richard lehoux : i 'm not sure the minister understood my question about the canada emergency student benefit . i am very concerned about the agricultural sector , but the tourist and horticultural sectors are also on my mind . a number of business owners in my riding have reached out to me because the shortage of student workers is forcing them to shut down for the summer . this government has pulled the rug out from under them with the benefit it introduced for students . minister , what do you have to say to those business owners in the tourist and horticultural sectors whom you are not helping ? hon . carla qualtrough : mr . chair , with all due respect , i believe we are helping students . we 've heard very clearly from the students that they want to work and want to serve in their communities in this time of crisis . that 's why we 're creating additional employment opportunities and an income support mechanism that allows them to work . we 're going to continue to look at ways we can support them through additional opportunities this summer . we know they want to work and they want to serve . mr. richard lehoux : i hope that we 'll see some concrete results . pork and beef producers are feeling the impact of the country 's shutdown triggered by the pandemic . processing plants are suspending operations and buyers are tearing up their contracts . for the past five years , the government has been saying that the programs to help producers will be improved . now more than ever , producers need these programs . however , the programs have n't been reviewed yet . when will the government make these changes , including the changes to agristability , and when can producers access them ? hon . chrystia freeland : we announced over $ 77 million in assistance for food processors to help them protect their workers and deal with the costs associated with the coronavirus . to help livestock and pork producers , we established agrirecovery , a national initiative that will provide $ 125million to help producers adapt to market changes . we 're launching the chair : mr.lehoux has the floor . mr. richard lehoux : thank you , mr.chair . i understand some of what the minister is saying . the measures announced at noon today received a very cold reception from the entire agriculture and agri-food sector , since the sector had asked for about $ 2.6billion . i think that it 's important to support our agri-food industry and our farms , given the significant need for sovereignty . many canadians in the agriculture and agri-food sector have made this clear , as i was saying earlier . something must be done quickly , before our country becomes completely dependent on its neighbours . has the government considered making significant changes to the various programs currently in place ? hon . chrystia freeland : our country , canada , will never depend on its neighbours or any other country for food . canada is a major beef , pork and grain producer . canada is an agricultural superpower and we should all take pride in that . i want to mention another significant part of our announcement today , which is the $ 50million surplus food purchase program . this is very significant . i think that all canadians must support this initiative . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ( brossardsaint-lambert , lib . ) ) : we 'll now move on to the next question . mr.calkins , the member for reddeerlacombe , has the floor . mrs. claude debellefeuille : madamchair , i 'm not impatient . however , i do n't understand the government 's lack of willingness to eliminate this mechanism , which is legal but completely immoral . our questions remain unanswered . my next question is for the minister of finance . the fdration de la relve agricole du qubec and the upa approached the minister of finance two weeks ago and still have n't received a response regarding the following issue . we know that many farms do n't pay wages . as a result , these farms are being penalized because they are n't eligible for the $ 40,000 in loans available through the canada emergency business account . to qualify for these loans , the farms needed a payroll of $ 20,000 to $ 1.5million in 2019 . does the minister of finance plan to respond to the farmers who want to access the $ 40,000 in loans ? hon . bill morneau : thank you , ms.debellefeuille . we know that the canada emergency response benefit must be made available to the people who need it . mr. damien kurek : on a point of order hon . bill morneau : that 's why we 're considering our approach . of course mr. damien kurek : i have a point of order . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : ministermorneau , please wait a moment . a member is raising a point of order . mr. kurek , do you have a point of order ? you have to unmute yourself . mr. damien kurek : yes . it 's that the translation is at the same volume as the minister . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : you 'll have to put yourself on english . rather , the minister has to put himself on french . hon . bill morneau : sorry . i was on the english channel . we know that the people who need the canada emergency response benefit must have access to it . that 's why we 're considering the challenges each time . if i receive a letter , i 'll look at it . once we have a response , we 'll pass it directly on to the member . the chair : the next question will go to mr. richards . mr. blake richards ( banffairdrie , cpc ) : this question is for the tourism minister . the tourism ministry was one of the first and hardest-hit industries during this crisis , yet despite the prime minister 's announcement over three weeks ago now of a plan to bring forward a tourism-specific aid package to help the businesses who employ millions of unemployed canadians who work in tourism , there 's still been nothing from this government . when will the government finally act to provide help to this nearly crippled industry ? hon . mlanie joly ( minister of economic development and official languages ) : mr . chair , obviously we know that the tourism sector has been deeply impacted . i had the chance to talk to many of the leaders in the sector , and clearly there 's a lot of anxiety . we also had the chance to work with all the g20 ministers of tourism all together , and we know we have to act the chair : we 'll now go back to mr. richards . mr. blake richards : i did n't really get much of an answer there . i hear a lot about talking and not much on action . tourism-based communities like the ones in banff and canmore , which i represent , are tourism-based economies and have unemployment rates of 85 % or higher . they also do n't qualify for a lot of the programs because they 're seasonal businesses and make most or all of their revenues for the year from may to october , so they 're at risk of losing their entire season . i have a couple of very specific questions . will the government consider making changes to the programs to make sure that seasonal businesses can get help ? what does the government plan to do to help the tourism industry recover after the pandemic ? hon . mlanie joly : thank you . obviously , the tourism sector has access to many measures , including the ceba account , the $ 40,000 account . they also have access to the wage subsidy . they have access to rent relief . they will be having access also to funding through the regional development agencies , and we 'll be coming up with the details soon . of course , in my colleague 's riding of banff , which is a fantastic place and a tourism gem , they will have access to the support through wd , western economic diversification . if there are particular cases you would like to raise with me , i would be more than happy to talk to you to see how , on the ground , we can help the tourism operators . mr. blake richards : mr . chair , clearly the tourism minister has n't been listening . she says she 's talking to the industry . she 's not hearing their concerns . what she just said does not address many of the concerns they have about being seasonal industries . it does n't address anything about their concerns about the hard economic recovery they 'll have after the pandemic . let 's try another minister and see if we can get some answers . another industry that 's very hard hit in my province and my riding is the oil and gas industry . it 's another industry the prime minister has promised to help , but there has n't been anything . clearly there 's a pattern here . the only so-called assistance there 's been to help hurting albertans in the oil patch has been measures to speed up the death of the industry that they work in . will the liberal government ever show any concern for albertans ? will they bring forward a plan to preserve canadian jobs ? will they put forward a plan to ensure the use of canadian oil before oil coming in from places like saudi arabia ? hon . seamus o'regan ( minister of natural resources ) : in fact , mr . chair , the federal government has taken several steps in recent weeks that will meaningfully support workers and communities that depend on this industry . we have the canada emergency wage subsidy , which covers 75 % of an employee 's wages for the employer . we have more liquidity for oil and gas companies through new loans of $ 15 million to $ 60 million from the business development bank of canada . we continue to step forward in our response to the impacts of covid-19 on my province here in newfoundland and labrador and on alberta and saskatchewan . these three provinces are being hit by two crises at the same time , a crisis of demand for oil and gas on the world markets and of course a crisis of public health with covid-19 . mr. blake richards : mr . chair , a lot of these things we 're hearing about are n't going to actually help the industry to recover . what we need to see is the government give the industry and the private sector the opportunity to succeed . maybe what they could do is consider expediting the approval of billions of dollars of private sector projects that would put thousands and thousands of canadians back to work . will the government consider looking at ways that we can expedite projects ? will they look at ways that we can encourage the use of canadian oil before the use of oil coming in from places like saudi arabia ?"
