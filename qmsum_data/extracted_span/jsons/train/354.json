    "query": "<s> what was said about the overlaps ?",
    "answer": "postdoc f : ok , it 's it 's very eh it 's very brief , i mean just let me just hand these out . oops . grad h : is this the same as the email or different ? phd c : thanks . postdoc f : it 's slightly different . i basically the same . phd a : same idea ? postdoc f : but , same idea . so , if you 've looked at this you 've seen it before , so basically , um as you know , uh part of the encoding includes a mark that indicates an overlap . it 's not indicated with , um uh , tight precision , it 's just indicated that ok , so , it 's indicated to to so the people know what parts of sp which which stretches of speech were in the clear , versus being overlapped by others . so , i used this mark and , um and , uh uh , divided the i wrote a script which divides things into individual minutes , of which we ended up with forty five , and a little bit . and , uh you know , minute zero , of course , is the first minute up to sixty seconds . and , um what you can see is the number of overlaps and then to the right , whether they involve two speakers , three speakers , or more than three speakers . and , um and , what i was looking for sp sp specifically was the question of whether they 're distributed evenly throughout or whether they 're bursts of them . um . and it looked to me as though uh , you know y this is just eh eh , this would this is not statistically verified , but it did look to me as though there are bursts throughout , rather than being localized to a particular region . the part down there , where there 's the maximum number of of , um overlaps is an area where we were discussing whether or not it would be useful to indi to s to code stress , uh , sentence stress as possible indication of , uh information retrieval . so it 's like , you know , rather , lively discussion there . professor d : what was what 's the the parenthesized stuff that says , like e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ? postdoc f : oh , th that 's the per cent . so , six is , uh two point eight percent of the total number of overlaps in the session . phd e : mm - hmm . phd c : mm - hmm . postdoc f : at the very end , this is when people were , you know , packing up to go basically , there 's this final stuff , i think we i do n't remember where the digits fell . i 'd have to look at that . but the final three there are no overlaps at all . and couple times there are not . phd e : mm - hmm . postdoc f : so , i it seems like it goes through bursts but , um that 's kind of it . phd e : mm - hmm . postdoc f : now , another question is is there are there individual differences in whether you 're likely to be overlapped with or to overlap with others . and , again i want to emphasize this is just one particular um one particular meeting , and also there 's been no statistical testing of it all , but i , um i took the coding of the i , you know , my i had this script figure out , um who was the first speaker , who was the second speaker involved in a two - person overlap , i did n't look at the ones involving three or more . and , um this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of who tended to be overlapping most often with who who else , and if you look at the marginal totals , which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom , you get the totals for an individual . so , um if you look at the bottom , those are the , um numbers of overlaps in which um adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look i 'm sorry , but you 're o alphabetical , that 's why i 'm choosing you and then if you look across the right , then that 's where he was the person who was the sp first speaker in the pair and got overlap overlapped with by somebody . phd e : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and , then if you look down in the summary table , then you see that , um th they 're differences in whether a person got overlapped with or overlapped by . grad h : is this uh just raw counts or is it postdoc f : raw counts . grad h : so it would be interesting to see how much each person spoke . phd b : mm - hmm . phd c : yeah . phd e : yeah yeah postdoc f : yes , very true very true grad h : normalized to how much postdoc f : it would be good to normalize with respect to that . now on the table i did take one step toward , uh away from the raw frequencies by putting , uh percentages . so that the percentage of time of the of the times that a person spoke , what percentage eh , w so . of the times a person spoke and furthermore was involved in a two two - person overlap , what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they th the overlappee ? and there , it looks like you see some differences , um , that some people tend to be overlapped with more often than they 're overlapped , but , of course , uh i e this is just one meeting , uh there 's no statistical testing involved , and that would be required for a for a finding of any kind of scientific reliability . professor d : s so , i it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that adam talked too much or something . grad h : no no actually , that would be actually statistically correct , professor d : yeah , yeah . postdoc f : no , no , no . phd e : yeah , yeah . yeah , yeah . postdoc f : yeah , that 's right . professor d : yeah . excuse me . postdoc f : that 's right . and i 'm you know , i 'm i do n't see a point of singling people out , professor d : b i i i rather enjoyed it , but but this postdoc f : now , this is a case where obviously phd a : but the numbers speak for themselves . phd e : he 's yeah , yeah , yeah . postdoc f : well , you know , it 's like i 'm not i 'm not saying on the tape who did better or worse grad h : yes , that 's right , so you do n't nee ok . professor d : sure . postdoc f : because i do n't think that it 's i you know , and and th here 's a case where of course , human subjects people would say be sure that you anonymize the results , and and , so , might as well do this . professor d : yeah . grad h : yeah , when this is what this is actually when jane sent this email first , is what caused me to start thinking about anonymizing the data . postdoc f : well , fair enough . fair enough . professor d : yeah . postdoc f : and actually , you know , the point is not about an individual , it 's the point about tendencies toward you know , different styles , different speaker styles . professor d : oh sure . postdoc f : and it would be , you know of course , there 's also the question of what type of overlap was this , and w what were they , and i and i and i know that i can distinguish at least three types and , probably more , i mean , the general cultural idea which w uh , the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th before you start talking , and and you know , i mean , w we know that an and they 've loosened up on that too s in the intervening time , that that that 's that 's viewed as being a culturally - relative thing , i mean , that you have the high - involvement style from the east coast where people will overlap often as an indication of interest in what the other person is saying . and grad h : uh - huh . phd b : exactly ! postdoc f : yeah , exactly ! well , there you go . fine , that 's alright , that 's ok . and and , you know , in contrast , so deborah d and also deborah tannen 's thesis she talked about differences of these types , that they 're just different styles , and it 's um you you ca n't impose a model of there of the ideal being no overlaps , and you know , conversational analysts also agree with that , so it 's now , universally a ag agreed with . and and , als i mean , i ca n't say universally , but anyway , the people who used to say it was strict , um now , uh do n't . i mean they they also you know , uh uh , ack acknowledge the influence of sub of subcultural norms and cross - cultural norms and things . so , um then it beco though so just just superficially to give um a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , i have at the bottom several that i noticed . so , uh , there are backchannels , like what adam just did now and , um um , anticipating the end of a question and simply answering it earlier , and there are several of those in this in these data where phd b : mm - hmm . postdoc f : because we 're people who 've talked to each other , um we know basically what the topic is , what the possibilities are and w and we 've spoken with each other so we know basically what the other person 's style is likely to be and so and t there are a number of places where someone just answered early . no problem . and places also which i thought were interesting , where two or more people gave exactly th the same answer in unison different words of course but you know , the basically , you know everyone 's saying `` yes `` or you know , or ev even more sp specific than that . so , uh , the point is that , um overlap 's not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be im i useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved . and that 's all i wanted to say on that , unless people have questions . professor d : well , of course th the biggest , um result here , which is one we 've we 've talked about many times and is n't new to us , but which i think would be interesting to show someone who is n't familiar with this is just the sheer number of overlaps . that that right ? that that , um phd e : yes , yes ! postdoc f : oh , ok interesting . phd e : yeah . professor d : here 's a relatively short meeting , it 's a forty forty plus minute meeting , and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps but , uh i think there 's one one minute there where there where where there was n't any overlap ? grad h : hundred ninety - seven . professor d : i mean , it 's uh throughout this thing ? phd a : it 'd be interesting professor d : it 's you have postdoc f : well , at the bottom , you have the bottom three . phd e : yeah . grad h : s n are postdoc f : so four four minutes all together with none none . phd a : but it w professor d : oh , so the bottom three did have s stuff going on ? there was speech ? postdoc f : yes , uh - huh . yeah . but just no overlaps . professor d : ok , so if the this phd a : it 'd be interesting to see what the total amount of time is in the overlaps , versus postdoc f : yes , exactly and that 's that 's where jose 's pro project comes in . phd e : yeah , yeah , i h i have this that infor i have th that information now . phd g : i was about to ask phd a : yeah . phd c : yeah . professor d : oh , about how much is it ? phd e : the the duration of eh of each of the overlaps . professor d : o oh , what 's what 's the what 's the average length ? phd e : m i i have n't averaged it now but , uh i i will , uh i will do the the study of the with the with the program with the uh , the different , uh the , nnn , distribution of the duration of the overlaps . professor d : you do n't know ? ok , you you don you do n't have a feeling for roughly how much it is ? yeah . phd e : mmm , because the the uh , @ @ is @ @ . professor d : yeah . phd e : the duration is , uh the variation the variation of the duration is uh , very big on the dat phd a : mm - hmm . postdoc f : i suspect that it will also differ , depending on the type of overlap involved . phd e : but eh professor d : oh , i 'm sure . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : so backchannels will be very brief phd e : because , on your surface eh a bit of zone of overlapping with the duration eh , overlapped and another very very short . postdoc f : and professor d : yeah . yeah . phd e : uh , i probably it 's very difficult to to because the the overlap is , uh on is only the in the final `` s `` of the of the the fin the the end the end word of the , um previous speaker with the the next word of the the new speaker . phd a : mm - hmm . phd e : um , i considered that 's an overlap but it 's very short , it 's an `` x `` with a and the idea is probably , eh when eh when eh , we studied th th that zone , eh eh , we h we have eh eh confusion with eh eh noise . phd a : mm - hmm . phd e : with eh that fricative sounds , but uh i have new information but i have to to study . professor d : yeah . yeah , but i i 'd u phd g : can i professor d : go ahead . postdoc f : yeah . phd g : you split this by minute , um so if an overlap straddles the boundary between two minutes , that counts towards both of those minutes . postdoc f : yes . mm - hmm . actually , um um actually not . uh , so le let 's think about the case where a starts speaking and then b overlaps with a , and then the minute boundary happens . and let 's say that after that minute boundary , um b is still speaking , and a overlaps with b , that would be a new overlap . but otherwise um , let 's say b comes to the conclusion of of that turn without anyone overlapping with him or her , in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute . phd g : no , but suppose they both talk simultaneously both a a portion of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two . postdoc f : ok . in that case , um my c the coding that i was using since we have n't , uh incorporated adam 's , uh coding of overlap yets , the coding of yeah , `` yets `` is not a word . uh since we have n't incorporated adam 's method of handling overl overlaps yet um then that would have fallen through the cra cracks . it would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because , um i wou i would n't be able to pick it up from the way it was encoded so far . we just have n't done th the precise second to sec you know , second to second coding of when they occur . professor d : i i i 'm i 'm i 'm confused now . so l l let me restate what i thought andreas was saying and and see . postdoc f : uh - huh . professor d : let 's say that in in second fifty - seven of one minute , you start talking and i start talking and we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds . postdoc f : yep . ok . mm - hmm . professor d : so we go over so we were we were talking over one another , and it 's just in each case , it 's just sort of one interval . right ? postdoc f : mm - hmm ? professor d : so , um we talked over the minute boundary . is this considered as one overlap in each of the minutes , the way you have done this . postdoc f : no , it would n't . it would be considered as an overlap in the first one . professor d : ok , so that 's good , i i think , in the sense that i think andreas meant the question , phd b : that 's that 's good , yeah , cuz the overall rate is phd g : yeah . grad h : statistical . phd b : yeah . postdoc f : mm - hmm . professor d : right ? postdoc f : yeah . they 're not double counted . phd g : other - otherwise you 'd get double counts , here and there . phd b : ah but , yeah . phd e : yeah . phd g : and then it would be harder professor d : yeah . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : i should also say i did a simplifying , uh count in that if a was speaking b overlapped with a and then a came back again and overlapped with b again , i i did n't count that as a three - person overlap , i counted that as a two - person overlap , and it was a being overlapped with by d . grad h : mm - hmm . postdoc f : because the idea was the first speaker had the floor and the second person started speaking and then the f the first person reasserted the floor kind of thing . phd b : yeah . postdoc f : these are simplifying assumptions , did n't happen very often , there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing . grad h : i want to go back and listen to minute forty - one . postdoc f : yeah , yeah . grad h : cuz i i i find it interesting that there were a large number of overlaps and they were all two - speaker . professor d : yeah . grad h : i mean what i thought what i would have thought in is that when there were a large number of overlaps , it was because everyone was talking at once , but uh apparently not . postdoc f : that 's interesting . that 's interesting . phd e : yeah . yeah . mmm . grad h : that 's really neat . professor d : yeah . postdoc f : yeah , there 's a lot of backchannel , a lot o a lot of grad h : this is really interesting data . postdoc f : yeah , it is . phd b : i think what 's really interesting though , it is before d saying `` yes , meetings have a lot of overlaps `` is to actually find out how many more we have than two - party . postdoc f : i think so too , i think phd b : cuz in two - party conversations , like switchboard , there 's an awful lot too if you just look at backchannels , if you consider those overlaps ? it 's also ver it 's huge . it 's just that people have n't been looking at that because they 've been doing single - channel processing for speech recognition . grad h : mm - hmm . professor d : mm - hmm ? phd b : so , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps do you have of , say the two - person type , by adding more people . to a meeting , and it may be a lot more but i it may it may not be . professor d : well , but see , i find it interesting even if it was n't any more , because since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in switchboard where it was just all separated out we just everything was just nice , phd b : mm - hmm ? professor d : so that so the issue is in in a situation where th that 's phd b : well , it 's not really `` nice `` . it depends what you 're doing . so if you were actually having , uh depends what you 're doing , if right now we 're do we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting . so the question is , you know `` are there really more overlaps happening than there would be in a two - person party `` . professor d : mm - hmm ? phd b : and and there well may be , but professor d : let let m let me rephrase what i 'm saying cuz i do n't think i 'm getting it across . what what i what i should n't use words like `` nice `` because maybe that 's too i too imprecise . but what i mean is that , um in switchboard , despite the many many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap . and what we 're doing now is , aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap and one of the reasons that we 're considering it , you know , one of them not all of them , one of them is that w uh at least , you know i 'm very interested in the scenario in which , uh both people talking are pretty much equally audible , and from a single microphone . and so , in that case , it does get mixed in , and it 's pretty hard to jus to just ignore it , to just do processing on one and not on the other . phd b : i i agree that it 's an issue here but it 's also an issue for switchboard and if you think of meetings being recorded over the telephone , which i think , you know , this whole point of studying meetings is n't just to have people in a room but to also have meetings over different phone lines . professor d : mm - hmm . phd b : maybe far field mike people would n't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply , professor d : mm - hmm . phd b : so if each of us was calling and having a meeting that way you kn you know like a conference call . and , just the question is , y you know , in switchboard you would think that 's the simplest case of a meeting of more than one person , professor d : mm - hmm . phd b : and i 'm wondering how much more overlap of the types that that jane described happen with more people present . so it may be that having three people is very different from having two people or it may not be . professor d : that 's an important question to ask . i think what i 'm all i 'm s really saying is that i do n't think we were considering that in switchboard . phd b : not you , me . but uh but but professor d : were you ? grad h : though it was n't in the design . professor d : were you were you were you were you measuring it ? i mean , w w were phd b : there there 's actually to tell you the truth , the reason why it 's hard to measure is because of so , from the point of view of studying dialogue , i mean , which dan jurafsky and andreas and i had some projects on , you want to know the sequence of turns . professor d : yeah . phd b : so what happens is if you 're talking and i have a backchannel in the middle of your turn , and then you keep going what it looks like in a dialogue model is your turn and then my backchannel , professor d : yeah . phd b : even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn . professor d : yeah ? phd b : so , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling it 's we know that that 's wrong in real time . professor d : yeah ? phd b : but , because of the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in switchboard were missing , people could n't study it , but that does n't mean in the real world that people do n't talk that way . so , it 's um professor d : yeah , i was n't saying that . right ? i was just saying that w now we 're looking at it . phd b : well , we 've als professor d : and and and , you you maybe wanted to look at it before but , for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you were n't . phd b : right . we 're looking at it here . professor d : so that 's why it 's coming to us as new even though it may well be you know , if your if your hypothes the hypothesis you were offering eh right ? if it 's the null poth { comment } hypothesis , and if actually you have as much overlap in a two - person , we do n't know the answer to that . the reason we do n't know the answer to is cuz it was n't studied and it was n't studied because it was n't set up . right ? phd b : yeah , all i meant is that if you 're asking the question from the point of view of what 's different about a meeting , studying meetings of , say , more than two people versus what kinds of questions you could ask with a two - person meeting . professor d : mm - hmm ? phd b : it 's important to distinguish that , you know , this project is getting a lot of overlap but other projects were too , but we just could n't study them . and and so uh professor d : may have been . may have been . right ? phd b : well , there is a high rate , professor d : we do kn we do n't know the numbers . phd b : so . it 's but i do n't know how high , in fact phd a : well , here i have a question . phd b : that would be interesting to know . professor d : see , i mean , i i le let me t i mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , `` what have we learned about overlaps here ? `` just never mind comparison with something else , phd b : mm - hmm . professor d : what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that the first the first - order thing i would say is that there 's a lot of them . right ? phd e : yeah . professor d : in in the sense that i if you said if i i i phd b : yeah , i i do n't di i agree with that . professor d : in a way , i guess what i 'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of how how much people overlap . uh you know the fact that when when when , uh , adam was looking for a stretch of of speech before , that did n't have any overlaps , and he w he was having such a hard time and now i look at this and i go , `` well , i can see why he was having such a hard time `` . phd b : right . that 's also true of switchboard . professor d : it 's happening a lot . phd b : it may not be professor d : i was n't saying it was n't . phd b : right . so it 's just , um professor d : right ? i was commenting about this . phd b : ok . all i 'm saying is that from the professor d : i 'm saying if i i 'm saying if i have this complicated thing in front of me , and we sh which , you know we 're gon na get much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data , but then , if i was gon na describe to somebody what did you learn right here , about , you know , the the modest amount of data that was analyzed i 'd say , `` well , the first - order thing was there was a lot of overlaps `` . in fact and it 's not just an overlap bunch of overlaps second - order thing is it 's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point , but that there 's overlaps , uh throughout the thing . grad h : right . phd b : right . no , i i agree with that . professor d : and that 's interesting . that 's all . phd b : i 'm just saying that it may the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting . professor d : oh yeah . phd b : and that 's all . professor d : yeah . yeah , i was n't making any statement about that . phd b : and and it would actually be interesting to find out professor d : yeah ."
