    "answer": "mr. terry duguid ( winnipeg south , lib . ) : mr . chair , today i want to give a special thank you to the health care workers at victoria general hospital , who are serving patients in our community here in winnipeg south . every day , doctors , nurses and staff work selflessly to take care of those in our community who need it most . whether it 's by keeping seniors connected with their families by using ipads or making sure that patients go home with a special care package , staff at the vic are doing extraordinary work to make this difficult time just a little bit easier . i would also like to give a big shout-out to our wonderful small businesses in winnipeg south that continue to show their appreciation by preparing meals for the hard-working staff at the vic . folks in our community continue to show what it means to be exemplary canadians , and it is a great honour to represent them . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : this concludes the period for statements by members . we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers . the honourable leader of the opposition . hon . andrew scheer : mr.chair , the staff of long-term care facilities for seniors are showing exceptional courage and dedication . franoislegault asked that the military personnel currently helping in facilities in quebec stay until the fall . the prime minister said no . i 'd like to hear the prime minister tell us why they ca n't stay . right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , like all canadians , i am deeply grateful for the extraordinary work that the canadian armed forces are doing in long-term care facilities in quebec and ontario . thanks to their reports , we 've seen that the situation was even worse than we feared . the work our military is doing is extraordinary . we will continue to support them , but we know that having military personnel in our long-term care facilities is n't a long-term solution . therefore , we are going to work with quebec to find better long-term solutions . hon . andrew scheer : mr . chair , now that bell canada has decided to partner with ericsson to deliver its 5g network , the liberals will undoubtedly ban huawei , but the liberal inaction on huawei is just another example of this government 's weak leadership . instead of deciding for himself a year ago , the prime minister is forcing the business community to make the decision for him . why could n't the prime minister have shown some backbone and banned huawei a year ago ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , our approach every step of the way has been to listen to experts , to work with allies and to listen to the counsel of our security and intelligence community , which has been looking into this issue . we know we need to make sure that canadian businesses , canadians and canadian infrastructure are protected at the same time as we remain competitive in the world . that has guided our approach on this from the beginning . hon . andrew scheer : the fact of the matter , mr chair , is that it has n't . the former public safety minister , ralph goodale , promised in this house over a year ago that an answer on huawei would be coming . here we are , it 's june 2 , 2020 , and they still have n't made a decision . on another topic , mr . chair , the president of the treasury board wrote to cabinet last week and said that transparency is important even in a time of crisis . i guess the minister of infrastructure did n't get that letter . she 's refusing to tell us how much of a bonus she gave to the departing head of the canada infrastructure bank . at a time when canadians are struggling , it is disgusting that the liberals are paying out bonuses to someone who accomplished nothing . will the prime minister have a little respect for taxpayers and tell us exactly how much of a bonus the ceo of the canada infrastructure bank received ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , the mandate of the canada infrastructure bank is to find innovative ways to finance some of canada 's biggest infrastructure projects by leveraging private capital . the remuneration range of the former ceo has been in the public domain for more than two years . the opposition is looking backward . we 're moving forward . the bank is moving into its next phase of development , now under the leadership of the new board chair , michael sabia , and will play an important role in the recovery when the time comes . hon . andrew scheer : mr . chair , only to a liberal would an innovative approach to building infrastructure mean building absolutely nothing . the ceo of an infrastructure bank who accomplished zero completed infrastructure projects should not be receiving a bonus . i did n't ask a question about the remuneration . i did n't ask a question about the salary . this individual received a bonus . how much was that bonus ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , as i said , the remuneration range of this former ceo has been in the public domain for more than two years . in regard to further payments , we do not comment on personal hr and financial information of individuals in government ."
