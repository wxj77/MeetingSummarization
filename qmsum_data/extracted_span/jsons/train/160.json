    "answer": "user interface : yeah . and we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here industrial designer : the l_e_d_ . user interface : and this 'll be the power point , the on off button kind project manager : oh . okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : i 'm sorry . project manager : oops . marketing : what was the where 's the l_e_d_ ? user interface : it 's in the middle of one of the little r_s . marketing : oh . okay . user interface : and then the other one is the power . and uh we just have a simple design . we wanted it all to be industrial designer : so it 's palm-held . user interface : accessible from your thumb industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah palm-held project manager : yeah . user interface : and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb . project manager : notice you have a number ten button . user interface : so you do n't have to oh that was a mistake , was n't it ? project manager : okay . industrial designer : you just need the nought . user interface : right no , that 's a zero . marketing : user interface : take that one off . sorry . i was in charge of the numbers . project manager : no problem . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : ah . user interface : and this is just if you 've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . industrial designer : so one plus one would be eleven , user interface : you can go one , three or something . industrial designer : or project manager : oh . you press a plus button ? user interface : you press that first and then you go one three yeah . project manager : oh okay . i 've never heard of that kind before . user interface : well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah because if you on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you 'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . project manager : yeah . marketing : oh , there 's no e industrial designer : so if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . user interface : so the plus and then marketing : okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : but would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? user interface : no no , th all that 's why we have all these numbers . these numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine . project manager : yeah but i mean if you press , it 'll go to that channel right away . 'cause you got ta press the plus afterwards . user interface : yeah . oh no . uh , the plus is only for if you 're going past the number nine . project manager : yeah i know , but if if i wan na go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if i press the six it 'll go to channel six , and then i 'll press the plus , and then it 'll go to six and then put the five and it 'll go to sixty five ? marketing : sixty . user interface : you p oh . no you press the plus first . i i well it does n't we have n't really s i would 've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , marketing : user interface : but she says plus press which industrial designer : well i do n't mind , we can further define that . user interface : what do you think is simpler ? project manager : i th um user interface : it 's a industrial designer : i would n't have thought it 'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah it would n't be a problem . but i was just wondering industrial designer : but i suppose it 's not as snappy . user interface : yeah . project manager : like as long as we realise that 's what it 'll do . marketing : well the there is a there 's a delay on remotes i think . user interface : oops . yeah . marketing : where you can have it industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it 's like a five second input time . industrial designer : yeah . if you do n't put it marketing : so as long as you hit them dada industrial designer : yeah . yeah , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : that yeah . marketing : it should be fine . project manager : yeah . marketing : as long as there 's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . so industrial designer : um marketing : was there so on the top there is volume and industrial designer : and channel , user interface : a channel . industrial designer : which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like marketing : channel up volume up . okay cool . project manager : c_ and v_ . user interface : just so we can flick project manager : right , where um where 's the power button ? marketing : yeah . user interface : it 's in the middle of one of the little r_s . industrial designer : it 's the bigger r_ . marketing : it 's the r_ . project manager : oh okay . industrial designer : so it 's just like . user interface : yeah , project manager : yeah . user interface : so it 's all accessible . without m taking your hand off the remote . industrial designer : we deci project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : because we thought that 's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . project manager : oh okay . industrial designer : uh e ergonomics are all considered . project manager : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . user interface : and it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . marketing : industrial designer : it could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . user interface : okay . industrial designer : but yeah , no i mean it 's a different movement marketing : industrial designer : so yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um and the feel of it , i mean , we 've made this out of play doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . project manager : user interface : project manager : the spon yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-r_s_i_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and it just feels feels different . user interface : yeah . project manager : bit of a stress ball feel . industrial designer : would you like to feel it yourselves ? user interface : yeah . project manager : yes . i would . industrial designer : how it fits in the palm of your hand ? marketing : project manager : my goodness . industrial designer : thanks . marketing : project manager : there you go . industrial designer : and you ? project manager : genevieve ? yeah . marketing : . oh it 's nice . oh i think i killed the five . industrial designer : marketing : i did . project manager : and something hmm . marketing : i killed the four . oh god . industrial designer : o okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . user interface : of play doh yeah . marketing : oh it smells good . industrial designer : but we 're thinking that , seeing as we 're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . or the combination . um and we 're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , project manager : oh right . industrial designer : or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in user interface : 'cause it 'd be quite subtle and industrial designer : more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . project manager : yeah . it looks more think like vanilla and banana would . industrial designer : banana 's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black . project manager : okay yeah . user interface : yeah ."
