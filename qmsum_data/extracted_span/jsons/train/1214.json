    "query": "<s> why did kirsty williams disagree with hefin david when talking about the admission problems of wales universities and corresponding solutions ?",
    "answer": "hefin david am : how does the welsh government account for the fact that eu student applications in wales this year\u2014that wales is the only country in the uk to have seen a significant drop ? kirsty williams am : okay , well , i think the first thing to remember is that we will not get a full picture of student recruitment until , first of all , november and then the true picture , because some institutions , as you would know , have two admissions dates\u2014we wo n't get the full picture until the spring . i think it was inevitable , given the change in government policy with regard to student support , which had previously allowed european students to benefit from a tuition fee grant , and given the fact that that option is no longer available to them , that that has had an impact on eu recruitment , and there 's no point trying to hide from that . hefin david am : so , together with leaving the eu , that 's a double-whammy effect that 's hitting wales harder than the rest of the uk . kirsty williams am : it just puts us in the same position as eu students applying to england , but it was inevitable . this was looked at by diamond . it was anticipated that this could be a consequence of the change in policy , and i think we see that reflected in the initial figure , although , as i said , we wo n't get the true picture until the first census in november , and then , ultimately , the final picture in the spring . hefin david am : how concerned are you by that ? kirsty williams am : clearly , we want our universities to be able to attract students from both the eu and from around the world . the fact that the tuition fee grant arrangements may have had an impact on european union students at this stage does not preclude the fact that wales , up until now , has been successful in recruiting international students . so , the change in the fee regime should not be a barrier to the recruitment of international students , because , actually , international students outside of the eu make up a bigger proportion of students not from the uk who come to our institutions . hefin david am : that 's a fair point , but it 's unfortunate timing , though , is n't it ? kirsty williams am : i think , from a public policy point of view and moving towards a sustainable way of funding our he sector , then both my priority and , i would say , the priority of the institutions was to see the implementation of diamond , which is what we have done ."
