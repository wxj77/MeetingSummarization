    "answer": "llyr gruffydd am : so , you 're confident that that level of momentum is continuing through the consortia that was previously enjoyed by those particular schools , and you 're also confident that there is minimal risk that they 'll slip back to where they were , potentially , or at least part of the way back . kirsty williams am : well , actually , there are some really good examples of some of the schools challenge cymru schools making that sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end . you only have to look at tredegar , where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system . that school is now a green school , so they 've been able to sustain their progress at the end of the programme . if we look at armando in eastern high school , again\u2014gosh , my goodness me , we had lots of debates in a previous chamber about the future of eastern . there was one person that said that eastern had to be closed and that the only way forward for that particular school was for it to be shut down , but what we have seen is investment via schools challenge cymru , but ongoing , continual support from the regional consortium , and that school has come out of special measures . i pay absolute tribute to the staff of that school and that community that have done such a good job . so , i 'm absolutely convinced that where we 've got good leadership and good support , some of those schools are making continued , sustained progress even after the end of the programme . the challenge for me is for those schools that schools challenge cymru did n't work for , and we have n't seen that progress\u2014how we can use our school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools to give them the level of support that they need to make a difference . so that 's what my focus is on now : a whole-system approach , rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support , when we recognise that there are schools everywhere , potentially , that need intervention , support and challenge , and in the primary sector as well . llyr gruffydd am : okay . so , you would n't agree with a number of\u2014well , the near-unanimous evidence that we 've had from academics , some of whom are government advisers from consortia et cetera , that this kind of programme such as schools challenge cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have ."
