    "query": "<s> why did they take education through regional working as an example ?",
    "answer": "hefin david am : okay . i 'm happy to accept that you 've changed your opinion there ; that 's no problem at all . but with regard to the four consortia , and we 'll take education through regional working as an example , it does things differently to the other three . is that a cause for concern , or do you think that 's entirely appropriate ? kirsty williams am : well , erw does things differently , but then so does the education achievement service . eas is constituted in a different way to the central south consortium . what i 'm interested in is not necessarily how they are constituted and organised , i 'm interested in the effectiveness of that organisation to deliver for children and for teachers . erw has got particular challenges , and we continue to work with those in erw to address those , but increasingly , as i said , what we are seeing the regional consortia do is develop a national approach to school improvement services but deliver that on a regional basis so that there is greater consistency in terms of delivery . hefin david am : are you happy that , within the erw area , local authorities employ their own improvement advisers , rather than doing it in the way that the others do ?"
