    "answer": "suzy davies am : okay . well , i agree with you on that , actually , which is why i was a bit confused when you had some in-year additional money in this year 's budget that was being given out to consortia rather than to schools to improve the ability of their teachers to deliver the welsh baccalaureate in certain schools . can you tell me whether the money\u2014i think it was about \u00a35 million that was going to the consortia in-year\u2014will you will offer them suggestions that that is used for improving baccalaureate teaching ?"
