    "answer": "phd c : adam , what is the mike that , uh , jeremy 's wearing ? grad f : it 's the ear - plug mike . postdoc a : ear - plug . phd e : that 's good . phd c : is that a wireless , or ? oh . grad g : it 's wired . postdoc a : is that does that mean you ca n't hear anything during the meeting ? grad d : it 's old - school . grad f : huh ? what ? huh ? professor b : should we , uh , close the door , maybe ? grad f : it it 's a fairly good mike , actually . professor b : so it 's yeah . huh . grad f : well , i should n't say it 's a good mike . all i really know is that the signal level is ok . i do n't know if it 's a the quality . professor b : well , that 's a grad f : ugh ! so i did n't send out agenda items because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item and now we have two . so . and , uh . professor b : ok . so , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week , it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ? was that sort of the division ? grad f : right . professor b : so which week are we in ? grad f : well we have n't really started , but i thought we more we more or less did meeting recorder stuff last week , so i thought we could do , uh professor b : i thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too . phd c : yeah . grad f : but i figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . professor b : yeah . grad f : so . i seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted . here we go . so , uh , as most of you should know , i did send out the consent form thingies and , uh , so far no one has made any ach ! { comment } { comment } any comments on them . so , no on no one has bleeped out anything . professor b : um . yeah . grad f : so . i do n't expect anyone to . but . professor b : um . so , w what follows ? at some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? grad f : no . we had spoken w about this before professor b : yeah , but i 've forgotten . grad f : and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once . and the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity . so as long as we do that , we 're covered . professor b : and how long of an opportunity did you tell them ? grad f : uh , july fifteenth . professor b : july fifteenth . oh , so they have a plenty of time , and y given that it 's that long , um , um why was that date chosen ? you just felt you wanted to ? grad f : jane told me july fifteenth . so , that 's what i set it . postdoc a : oh . i just meant that that was the release date that you had on the data . professor b : oh , ok . grad f : oh . i i did n't understand that there was something specific . postdoc a : i , uh i thought grad f : you y you had professor b : i do n't grad f : i had heard july fifteenth , so that 's what i put . postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : no , the only th the only mention i recall about that was just that july fifteenth or so is when this meeting starts . postdoc a : that 's right . that 's why . professor b : oh , i see . postdoc a : you said you wanted it to be available then . i did n't mean it to be the hard deadline . professor b : right . postdoc a : it 's fine with me if it is , or we cou but i thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that in case , uh you know , `` by the way this is your last `` professor b : right . postdoc a : uh . yeah . professor b : we probably should have talked about it , cuz i because if we wan na be able to give it to people july fifteenth , if somebody 's gon na come back and say `` ok , i do n't want this and this and this used `` , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that . right ? grad f : yeah . as i said , we i just got one date professor b : yeah . phd h : damn ! grad f : and that 's the one i used . professor b : yeah . grad f : so . but i can send a follow - up . i mean , it 's almost all us . i mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , uh , these the meetings that in are in set one . phd c : was my was my response ok ? postdoc a : that 's right . phd c : i just wrote you replied to the email saying they 're all fine . grad f : right . i mean , that 's fine . phd c : ok , good . grad f : i we do n't my understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we do n't actually need a reply . phd c : that makes it easy . grad f : we just need to tell them that they can do it if they want . professor b : ok . i just did n't remember , but grad f : and so no reply is no changes . postdoc a : and he 's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is `` ok `` . so that 's very clear all the way down the page , `` ok `` . and they have two options they can change it to . one of them is `` censor `` , and the other one is `` incorrect `` . is it is your word is `` incorrect `` ? grad f : right . postdoc a : which means also we get feedback on if um , there 's something that they w that needs to be adjusted , because , i mean , these are very highly technical things . i mean , it 's an added , uh , level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription , as i see it . but in any case , people can agree to things that are wrong . grad f : well yeah . the reason i did that it was just so that people would not censor not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly , postdoc a : and the reason i liked it was because grad f : as opposed to , uh postdoc a : was because it , um it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it . grad f : right . postdoc a : approve it and correct it . and um . so , you have it nicely set up so they email you and , uh grad f : when they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me . postdoc a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . and i wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are robustness and meeting recorder . the german ones will be ready for next week . those are three three of those . a different set of people . and we can impose phd c : the german ones ? postdoc a : uh , well . phd h : yeah . those uh postdoc a : ok . i spoke loosely . the the german , french sorry , the german , dutch , and spanish ones . phd e : spanish . yeah . grad f : mm - hmm . phd c : oh , those are the nsa meetings ? phd e : the non - native phd h : those are postdoc a : yeah . uh - huh . professor b : german , dutch , swiss and spanish . phd c : oh , oh ! ok . phd e : the all non - native postdoc a : that 's that 's that 's r grad f : mm - hmm . phd h : uh - huh . phd c : ok . i 'd i d postdoc a : yeah . it 's the other group . professor b : i it was the network network services group . postdoc a : uh - huh . yeah , exactly . yeah . professor b : yeah . postdoc a : i did n't mean to isolate them . professor b : otherwise known as the german , dutch , and spanish . postdoc a : yeah . sorry . it was it was not the best characterization . grad f : mm - hmm . postdoc a : but what what i meant to say was that it 's the other group that 's not n no m no overlap with our present members . and then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , something like a week before that , uh , j july fifteenth date , or two weeks before . professor b : i mean , i would suggest we discuss i mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it , that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people , grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so that we have a uniform thing . so , tha that 's a month , which is fine . i mean , it seems phd c : twelve hours . grad f : well , the only thing i said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth . i did n't give any other deadline . postdoc a : mm - hmm . grad f : so my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , `` wow i suddenly found something `` , we 'll delete it from our record . we just wo n't delete it from whatever 's already been released . postdoc a : hmm . that 's a little bit difficult . grad f : what else can we do ? postdoc a : yeah . grad f : if someone says `` hey , look , i found something in this meeting and it 's libelous and i want it removed `` . what can we do ? postdoc a : well . that 's true . grad f : we have to remove it . postdoc a : i i agree with that part , but i think that it would it , uh we need to have , uh , a a a message to them very clearly that beyond this date , you ca n't make additional changes . professor b : i mean , um , i i i i think that somebody might request something even though we say that . but i think it 's good to at least start some place like that . postdoc a : mm - hmm . good . professor b : so if we agreed , ok , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , i think we should just say that say that , you know , i a as um , `` per the the the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff `` and so forth `` and , uh , because we w `` these , uh i would i would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say `` because we , uh , will continually be making these things available to other researchers , uh , this ca n't be open - ended and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time `` , whatever time we agree upon . grad f : well , did you read the email and look at the pages i sent ? professor b : did i ? no , i have n't yet . no , just grad f : no . ok , well why do n't you do that and then make comments on what you want me to change ? professor b : no , no . i 'm not saying that you should change anything . i i 'm what i 'm what i 'm i 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it so that that you can you can , uh , decide on something . postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : so i 'm not telling you what to decide . postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : i 'm just saying you should decide something , and then grad f : i already did decide something , and that 's what 's in the email . postdoc a : yeah , yeah . ok , so grad f : and if you disagree with it , why do n't you read it and give me comments on it ? postdoc a : yeah . well i i think that there 's one missing line . professor b : well , the one thing that i did read and that you just repeated to me was that you gave the specific date of july fifteenth . grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : and you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you . so what i 'm telling you is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough grad f : right . professor b : and you should use that rather than this date that you just got from somewhere . that 's all i 'm saying . postdoc a : i ha i have one question . this is in the summer period and presumably people may be out of town . but we can make the assumption , ca n't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . right ? because if someone professor b : it well , it well , you 're right . sometimes somebody will be away and , uh , you know , there 's , uh for any length of time that you uh , choose there is some person sometime who will not end up reading it . that 's it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take . phd h : s so maybe when am i on , by the way ? grad f : i do n't know . you should be . phd h : oh . hello ? hello ? grad f : you should be channel b . phd h : oh , ok . alright . so . the , um maybe we should say in w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the the agreement that you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how how they will be contacted and they can , you know they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both . and , um , then postdoc a : we did that , i i believe . phd h : right . phd e : yeah . phd h : so . a and , then , you know , say very clearly that if they do n't if we do n't hear from them , you know , as morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain period after we contact them that is implicitly giving their agreement . grad f : well , they 've already signed a form . postdoc a : and the form says phd e : and nobody nobody really reads it anyway . phd h : right . grad f : so . and the s and the form was approved by human subjects , phd h : says that . right . postdoc a : uh , the f phd h : well , if that 's i tha if that 's already if grad f : so , eh , that 's gon na be a little hard to modify . postdoc a : well , the form well , the form does n't say , if uh , you know , `` if you do n't respond by x number of days or x number of weeks `` phd h : i see . uh oh , ok . so what does it say about the the the process of of , uh y the review process ? postdoc a : it does n't have a time limit . that you 'll be provided access to the transcripts and then , uh , allowed to remove things that you 'd like to remove , before it goes to the general uh , larger audience . phd h : oh , ok . hmm . right . grad f : here . postdoc a : there you go . grad f : you can read what you already signed . phd e : i guess when i read it , um i 'm not as diligent as chuck , but i had the feeling i should probably respond and tell adam , like , `` i got this and i will do it by this date , and if you do n't hear from me by then `` you know , in other words responding to your email once , right away , saying `` as soon as you get this could you please respond . `` grad f : right . phd e : and then if you if the person thinks they 'll need more time because they 're out of town or whatever , they can tell you at that point ? because grad f : oh , i just i did n't wan na do that , because i do n't wan na have a discussion with every person if i can avoid it . phd e : well , it 's grad f : so what i wanted to do was just send it out and say `` on the fifteenth , the data is released , postdoc a : mm - hmm . grad f : if you wan na do something about it , do something about it , but that 's it `` . postdoc a : i i kind of like this . phd e : well postdoc a : yeah . phd e : ok . so , we 're assuming that phd h : well , that 's that would be great if but you should probably have a legal person look at this and make sure it 's ok . because if you if you , uh , do this and you then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they did n't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually exercise their their right phd e : or they they might never have gotten the email , because although they signed this , they do n't know by which date to expect your email . and so someone whose machine is down or whatever i mean , we have no professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : in internally we know that people are there , grad f : well , ok . l let me let me reverse this . phd e : but we have no confirmation that they got the mail . grad f : so let 's say someone i send this out , and someone does n't respond . do we delete every meeting that they were in ? phd e : well , then grad f : i do n't think so . phd e : it we 're hoping that does n't happen , but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail grad f : that will happen . phd e : or phd h : that will happen . phd e : right . grad f : that will absolutely happen . because people do n't read their email , or they 'll read and say `` i do n't care about that , i 'm not gon na delete anything `` and they don just wo n't reply to it . phd h : maybe uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? grad f : no . we have what they put on the speaker form , postdoc a : well { comment } most grad f : which was just generic contact information . postdoc a : but the ones that we 're dealing with now are all local , phd h : well , then postdoc a : except the ones who i mean , we we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups . phd h : mmm . ok . postdoc a : so maybe , uh , i you know , that 's not that many people and if i if , uh i i there is an advantage to having them admit and if i can help with with processing that , i will . it 's it 's there is an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating grad f : yeah . i mean i thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago . postdoc a : yes , we did . grad f : and so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again . postdoc a : you 're right . well , i you know . but sometimes professor b : well , we we have n't experienced it before . postdoc a : that 's right . professor b : right ? so phd e : you 'll either wonder at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end . postdoc a : need to get it right . phd e : i mean , there 's no way to get around i it 's pretty much the same am amount of work except for an additional email just saying they got the email . postdoc a : yeah . phd e : and maybe it 's better legally to wonder before you know , a little bit earlier than grad f : well postdoc a : it 's much easier to explain this way . grad f : ok . well , why do n't you talk t postdoc a : t t to have it on record . grad f : morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it , and find out what the status is on this ? cuz i do n't wan na do something that we do n't need to . postdoc a : yeah , but w mmm . grad f : because what i 'm telling you , people wo n't respond to the email . no matter what you do , you there 're gon na be people who you 're gon na have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with . postdoc a : well , then we make the effort . grad d : i mean , i it 's k grad f : and do we want to spend that effort ? postdoc a : we make the effort . grad d : it 's kind of like signing up for a mailing list . they have opt in and opt out . and there are two different ways . i mean , and either way works probably , i mean . postdoc a : except i really think in this case i i 'm agr i agree with liz , that we need to be in the clear and not have to after the fact say `` oh , but i assumed `` , and `` oh , i 'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you `` , you know . professor b : if this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it . postdoc a : oh , excellent . professor b : but the thing is that , you know , i i i think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , from my previous conversations with them , my my sense very much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this . grad f : well , we had talked about this before professor b : mm - hmm . grad f : and i thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that and they said you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form that they 've already signed once . postdoc a : i do n't remember that this issue of the time period allowed for response was ever covered . grad f : yeah . professor b : yeah . we never really talked about that . phd e : or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you . postdoc a : or or how they would indicate professor b : yeah . phd e : they probably forgot all about it . professor b : we certainly did n't talk , uh , about with them at all about , uh , the manner of them being made the , uh , uh , materials available . phd e : yeah . phd h : we do it like with these professor b : that was something that was sort of just within our implementation . phd h : we can use it we can use a a ploy like they use to , um you know , that when they serve , like uh , uh , uh { comment } uh , you know , like dead - beat dads , they they they make it look like they won something in the lottery and then they open the envelope grad d : and they 're served . phd h : and that right ? because and then the the the the thing is served . so you just make it , you know , `` oh , you won you know , go to this web site and you 've , uh you 're `` phd e : that 's why you never open these things that come in the mail . postdoc a : that one . professor b : yeah . grad f : well , it 's just , we 've gone from one extreme to the other , where at one point , a few months ago , morgan was you were saying let 's not do anything , phd h : right . right . no , it i it might postdoc a : well , it does n't matter . phd h : i i it it might well be the case grad f : and now we 're we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ? phd h : it might right . grad f : i mean , what are we gon na doing here ? phd h : it might well be the case that that this is perfectly you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh , assume their consent if they do n't reply . professor b : well . grad f : mm - hmm . phd h : but , i 'm not you know , me not being a lawyer , i would n't just wan na do that without having the the expert , uh , opinion on that . postdoc a : and how many people ? al - altogether we 've got twenty people . these people are people who read their email almost all the time . grad f : then i think we had better find out , so that we can find a phd h : yeah . professor b : let me look at this again . grad f : right . postdoc a : i i really do n't see that it 's a problem . i i think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have @ @ { comment } us try to contact them , grad f : for for th postdoc a : u just in case they had n't gotten their email . i think they 'd appreciate it . professor b : yeah . my adam , my my view before was about the nature of what was of the presentation , grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : of of how my my the things that we 're questioning were along the lines of how easy uh , h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : that was the kind of dispute i was making before . postdoc a : mm - hmm . i remember that . professor b : but , um , the attorneys , i uh , i can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things , but they will always come back with saying that , um , you need to you want to have someth some paper trail or which includes electronic trail that they have , uh , in fact o k 'd it . grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so , um , i think that if you f i if we send the email as you have and if there 's half the people , say , who do n't respond at all by , you know , some period of time , we can just make a list of these people and hand it to , uh you know , just give it to me and i 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever , grad f : right . professor b : and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , `` have you is is this ok ? and would you please mail you know , mail adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . `` so , you know , we can we can do that . phd e : the other thing that there 's a psychological effect that at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying `` yes , i will do it `` or `` yes , i got your email `` , they 're more likely to actually do it { comment } later than to just ignore it . professor b : mm - hmm . phd e : and of course we do n't want them to bleep things out , but it it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd { comment } at al at all . that 's how these mailing houses work . so , i mean , it 's not completely lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses . postdoc a : mm - hmm . phd e : you know , an official ok from somebody is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email . and they 're probably more likely to do that once they 've responded that they got the email . postdoc a : i also think they 'd just simply appreciate it . i think it 's a good a good way of of fostering goodwill among our subjects . well , our participants . professor b : i think the main thing is i mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases . grad f : sending lots of spam . professor b : so they s so so tha - that 's what they 're paid to do . and so , it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something and they would n't actually hear from us , and then they find this thing is in there and we 've already distributed it to someone . so , what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah , postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor b : but if in fact if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they did n't actually receive it for some reason , um , then we have n't given them that . grad f : well , so how far do we have to go ? do we need to get someone 's signature ? or , is email enough ? professor b : i i i em email is enough . grad f : do we have to have it notarized ? i mean ok . professor b : yeah . i mean , i 've been through this i mean , i 'm not a lawyer , but i 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so i i i i 'm pretty comfortable with that . phd c : do you track , um , when people log in to look at the ? grad f : uh . if they submit the form , i get it . phd c : uh - huh . grad f : if they do n't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . but that 's not sufficient . right ? cuz if someone just visits the web site that does n't imply anything in particular . phd c : except that you know they got the mail . postdoc a : mm - hmm . that 's right . grad f : right . postdoc a : i i could get you on the notify list if you want me to . grad f : i 'm already on it . postdoc a : for that directory ? ok , great . grad f : mm - hmm . professor b : so again , hopefully , um , this should n't be quite as odious a problem either way , uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about because uh , we 're talking a pretty small number of people . grad f : w for this set , i 'm not worried , because we basically know everyone on it . professor b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad f : you know , they 're all more or less here or it 's it 's eric and dan and so on . but for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are gone from icsi , whose email addresses may or may not work , professor b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad f : and so what are we gon na do when we run into someone that we ca n't get in touch with ? postdoc a : i do n't think , uh they 're so recent , these visitors . grad f : mm - hmm . postdoc a : i and and i they 're also so professor b : mm - hmm . postdoc a : they 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through i i mean , i i w i 'll be able to if you have any trouble finding them , i really think i could find them . grad f : other methods ? ok . professor b : yeah . cuz it what it what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission . um , and i think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and and ask their permission and they 're not there , it does n't seem { comment } that that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here . so . grad f : well , the qu the question is just whether how active it has to be . i mean , because they they filled out a contact information and that 's where i 'm sending the information . professor b : right . grad f : and so far everyone has done email . there is n't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method . professor b : well , the way icsi goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc have forwards to other accounts and so on . grad f : yeah . professor b : so it 's unusual that that they , uh grad f : so my original impression was that that was sufficient , that if they give us contact information and that contact information is n't accurate that we fulfilled our burden . professor b : yeah . phd e : then they just come back . phd c : all my files were still here . phd e : same as us . postdoc a : i just professor b : so if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe i will call the attorney about it . phd c : yeah . professor b : but , you know , hopefully we wo n't need to . postdoc a : i d i just do n't think we will . for all the reasons that we 've discussed . grad f : alright . professor b : so we 'll we 'll see if we do or not . grad f : yep . and we 'll see how many people respond to that email . postdoc a : yeah . grad f : so far , two people have . professor b : yeah . i think very few people will and and and , you know , people people see long emails about things that they do n't think is gon na be high priority , they typically , uh , do n't do n't read it , or half read it . grad f : right . professor b : cuz people are swamped . postdoc a : and actually , professor b : but postdoc a : um , i i did n't anticipate this so i that 's why i did n't give this comment , and it i this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying `` by the way , you know , we wan na hear back from you by x date and please `` , and then add what liz said `` please , uh , respond to please indicate you received this mail . `` professor b : uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um , `` even if you 've decided you have no changes you 'd like to make , if you could tell us that `` . grad f : respond to the email . { comment } yep . postdoc a : mm - hmm . it is the first time through the cycle . professor b : yeah . phd e : right . that would that would definitely work on me . you know , it makes you feel m like , um , if you were gon na p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that . whereas , i i mean , i would be much more likely myself , phd c : and the other th phd e : given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying `` you know what , i 'm probably not gon na get to it `` or whatever , rather than just having seen the email , thinking i might get to it , and never really , uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late . phd c : yeah . i was i was thinking that it also lets them know that they do n't have to go to the page to accept this . phd e : right . r right . that 's true . professor b : right . phd c : i mean , i i yeah . so that way they could they can see from that email that if they just write back and say `` i got it , no changes `` , they 're off the hook . professor b : yeah . phd c : they do n't have to go to the web page professor b : i mean , the other thing i 've learned from dealing with dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , if you say `` you 've got three months to do this review `` , um , people do it , you know , two and seven eighths months from now . phd c : and phd e : yeah . that 's true . professor b : if you say `` you 've got three weeks to do this review `` , they do do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now they do the review . grad f : right . professor b : and , um so , if we make it a little less time , i do n't think it 'll be that much grad f : well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first , if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time . professor b : there 's the responding part and there 's also what if , uh , i mean , i hope this does n't happen , what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes ? grad f : right . professor b : then we actually have to deal with that postdoc a : mm - hmm . some lead time . professor b : if we want it to grad f : ugh ! disk space , postdoc a : by the way , has has jeremy signed the form ? grad f : oh my god ! i had n't thought about that . that for every meeting any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . phd c : just that channel . grad d : ca n't you just do that channel ? phd c : oh , no . we have to do grad f : no , of course not . phd e : yeah . you have to do all of them , grad f : you need all the channels . phd c : do you have to do the other close - talking ? phd e : as well as all of these . grad d : yeah . phd e : you have to do all you could just do it in that time period , though , grad f : yes . absolutely . there 's a lot of cross - talk . postdoc a : well phd e : but i guess it 's a pain . grad f : well , but you have to copy the whole file . phd e : yeah . grad f : right ? because we 're gon na be releasing the whole file . phd e : yeah . you 're right . postdoc a : well i you know , i think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy . grad f : yeah . it 's just i hate deleting any data . so i i do n't want i really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out professor b : are you del are you bleeping it by adding ? grad f : and then overlapping . so , it 's it 's exactly a censor bleep . so what i really think is `` bleep `` professor b : i i i i understand , but is is it summing signals grad f : and then i want to professor b : or do you delete the old one and put the new one in ? grad f : i delete the old one , put the new one in . professor b : oh , ok . cuz grad f : there 's nothing left of the original signal . professor b : oh . cuz if you were summing , you could no . but anyway grad f : yeah . it would be qui quite easy to get it back again . postdoc a : but and then w i was gon na say also that the they do n't have to stay on the system , as you know , professor b : yeah . phd e : then someday we can sell the unedited versions . postdoc a : cuz cuz the the ones grad f : say again ? postdoc a : once it 's been successfully bleeped , ca n't you rely on the ? phd c : or we 'll tell people the frequency of the beep professor b : encrypt it . phd c : and then they could subtract the beep out . grad d : you can hide it . yeah . postdoc a : ca n't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version ? phd h : oh , yeah . grad d : it would n't be that hard to hide it . phd e : right . exactly . i see . grad f : yeah , that 's true . yeah . yep , that 's true . phd e : see , this is good . i wanted to create some side conversations in these meetings . professor b : yeah . you could encrypt it , you know , with a with a two hundred bit thousand bit , uh grad d : you can use spread spectrum . phd c : uh - huh . grad d : hide it . phd e : so phd c : here we go . phd e : yeah . yeah . grad d : yeah , there you go . phd e : cuz we do n't have enough asides . phd h : i have an idea . you reverse the signal , grad d : there you go . phd h : so it it lets people say what they said backwards . grad f : backwards . grad d : then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages , grad f : but , ha you 've seen the this the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments . phd h : yeah . grad d : like . grad f : did you read that paper ? it would n't work . the speech recognizer still works . phd e : yeah . and if you do it backward then professor b : yeah . phd c : that 's cuz they use forward - backward . phd e : h - good old hmm . grad f : forward but backward . that 's right . phd e : no , it 's backward - forward . grad f : good point . a point . well , i 'm sorry if i sound a little peeved about this whole thing . it 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved . professor b : well , but we never also we 've also never done it . postdoc a : this is the first cycle . phd e : if it makes grad f : yeah . postdoc a : there 're bound to be some glitches the first time through . professor b : so . and , uh and i 'm sorry responding without , uh , having much knowledge , but the thing is , uh , i am , like , one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and and stuff comes in as grad f : well , and that 's exactly why i did it the way i did it , which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gon na release it . professor b : yeah . grad f : because , you know , i have my stack of emails of to d to be done , that , you know , fifty or sixty long , and the ones at the top i 'm never gon na get to . professor b : right . grad f : and , uh so so phd c : move them to the bottom . professor b : so so the only thing we 're missing is is some way to respond to easily to say , uh , `` ok , go ahead `` or something . grad f : yeah , right . so , i this is gon na mean phd c : just re - mail them to yourself and then they 're at the bottom . professor b : yeah . grad f : yeah . postdoc a : yeah . grad f : yeah . that 's actually definitely a good point . the m email does n't specify that you can just reply to the email , as op as opposed to going to the form postdoc a : mm - hmm . phd h : in postdoc a : and it also does n't give a a specific i did n't think of it . phd e : right . grad f : and postdoc a : s i think it 's a good idea an ex explicit time by which this will be considered definite . grad f : yeah , release . postdoc a : and and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint . professor b : yeah . it 's converging . postdoc a : yeah . that 's right . phd h : this um , i 've seen this recently . uh , i got email , and it i if i use a mime - capable mail reader , it actually says , you know , click on this button to confirm receipt of the of the mail . postdoc a : oh , that 's interesting . phd h : so grad f : you you can grad d : it 's like certified mail . grad f : a lot of mailers support return receipt . postdoc a : could do that . phd h : right . grad f : but it does n't confirm that they 've read it . phd h : no , no , no . this is different . this is not so , i i know , you can tell , you know , the , uh , mail delivery agent to to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox . grad f : right . phd h : but but , no . this was different . ins - in the mail , there was a grad f : oh , just a button . phd h : uh , th there was a button that when you clicked on it , it would send , uh , you know , a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail . grad f : oh , yeah . yeah . unfor - yeah , we could do that . but i hate that . phd h : but it o but it only works for , you know , mime - capable you know , if you use netscape or something like that for your n grad f : yeah . professor b : and phd e : you might as well just respond to the mail . professor b : and we actually need a third thing . phd e : i mean phd h : right . professor b : it 's not that you 've looked at it , it 's that you 've looked at it and and and agree with one of the possible actions . phd h : no , no . you can do that . professor b : right ? phd h : you know , you can put this button anywhere you want , professor b : oh ? oh , i see . phd h : and you can put it the bottom of the message and say `` here , by you know , by clicking on this , i i agree uh , you know , i acknowledge `` professor b : that i i my first - born children are yours , and yeah . yeah . phd e : quick question . are , um grad f : well , i could put a url in there without any difficulty and even pretty simple mime readers can do that . so . postdoc a : but why should n't they just email back ? i do n't see there 's a problem . professor b : yeah . grad f : yeah . reply . phd h : right . postdoc a : it 's very nice . i i like the high - tech aspect of it , professor b : yeah . postdoc a : but i think phd h : no , no , no . i actually do n't . postdoc a : i appreciate it . phd h : i 'm just saying that grad f : well , i cuz i use a text mail reader . phd h : if ev but i 'm phd e : do n't you use vi for your mai ? phd h : yeah . professor b : wow . that 's that 's my guy . alright . grad f : you you read email in vi ? phd h : yeah . postdoc a : yeah . i like vi . phd h : so i i there 's these logos that you can put at the bottom of your web page , like `` powered by vi `` . grad d : yeah . i see . phd e : anyway , quick question . grad f : you could put wed bugs in the email . phd h : yeah . phd e : like , there were three meetings this time , or so or how many ? six ? but , no of different people . so i guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . but how i mean , it also depends on how many like , if we release this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ? in th grad f : well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready . phd e : i do n't know . oh . oh , ok . so this time was just the first chunk . ok . grad f : so . tha - that was my intention . it 's just yeah that we just happened to have a bunch all at once . phd e : well , that 's a good idea . grad f : i mean , maybe is that the way it 's gon na be , you think , jane ? postdoc a : i agree with you . it 's we could do it , uh i i could i 'd be happy with either way , batch - wise what i was thinking uh , so this one that was exactly right , that we had a uh , uh i i had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready . do n't have it . but , uh , this was the biggest clump i could do by a time where i thought it was reasonable . professor b : mm - hmm . postdoc a : people would be able to check it and still have it ready by then . my , um i was thinking that with the nsa meetings , i 'd like there are three of them , and they 're uh , i i will have them done by monday . uh , unfortunately the time is later and i do n't know how that 's gon na work out , but i thought it 'd be good to have that released as a clump , too , because then , you know , they 're they they have a it it 's in a category , it 's not quite so distracting to them , is what i was thinking , and it 's all in one chu but after that , when we 're caught up a bit on this process , then , um , i could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available . i could do it either way . i mean , it 's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking . professor b : we heard anything from ibm ? at all ? phd c : uh . let 's see . we yeah , right . so we got the transcript back from that one meeting . everything seemed fine . adam had a script that will put everything back together and there was well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix . and then , um , we , uh i sent him a pointer to three more . and so he 's off and working on those . grad f : yeah . now we have n't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff . postdoc a : that 's on my list . grad f : so at some point we need to do that . phd c : yeah . postdoc a : well , that 's on my list . phd c : yeah . it 's gon na have to go through our regular process . grad f : i mean , the one thing i noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . there are a fair number of `` yeahs `` and `` uh - huhs `` that it 's just that are n't in there . so . professor b : but i think yeah . like you said , i mean , that 's that 's gon na be our standard proc that 's what the transcribers are gon na be spending most of their time doing , i would imagine , postdoc a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm , mm - hmm . professor b : once once we grad f : yes , absolutely . yeah . postdoc a : one question about the backchannels . professor b : it 's gon na postdoc a : do you suppose that was because they were n't caught by the pre - segmenter ? grad f : yes , absolutely . absolutely . postdoc a : oh , interesting . oh , interesting . ok . grad f : yeah . they 're they 're not in the segmented . it 's not that the ibm people did n't do it . just they did n't get marked . postdoc a : ok . so maybe when the detector for that gets better or something i w i there 's another issue which is this we 've been , uh , contacted by university of washington now , of course , to , um we sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings and they 're downloading the audio files . so they 'll be doing that . chuck 's chuck 's , uh , put that in . phd c : mm - hmm . yeah , i pointed them to the set that andreas put , uh , on the web so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can . and , um , then once , uh , th we can also point them at the , um , uh , the original meetings and they can grab those , too , with scp . phd e : wait . so you put the reference files ? phd c : no , no . they d they wanted the audio . phd e : or the ? phd c : jane sent them the , uh , transcripts . phd e : no , i mean of the transcripts . um . well , we can talk about it off - line . phd c : mm - hmm . grad f : there 's another meeting in here , what , at four ? right ? yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five . phd h : d d so , does washi - does does uw wan na u do this wan na use this data for recognition or for something else ? phd c : uh , for recognition . phd e : i think they 're doing w did n't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts phd h : oh . i see . postdoc a : this is to show you , uh , some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure . professor b : yeah . phd e : or ? postdoc a : um @ @ { comment } so , this is from one of the nsa meetings and , uh , i if you 're familiar with the diff format , the arrow to the left is what it was , and the arrow to the right is what it was changed to . so , um . and now the first one . `` ok . so , then we started a weekly meeting . the last time , uh `` and the transcriber thought `` little too much `` but , uh , really , um , it was `` we learned too much `` , which makes more sense syntactically as well . phd h : and these the parentheses were f from postdoc a : then oh , this that 's the convention for indicating uncertain . grad f : u uncertains . postdoc a : so the transcriber was right . you know , she was uncertain about that . so she 's right to be uncertain . and it 's also a g a good indication of the of that . phd h : oh . { comment } ok . postdoc a : the next one . this was about , uh , claudia and she 'd been really b busy with stuff , such as waivers . uh , ok . um , next one . um . this was an interesting one . so the original was `` so that 's not so claudia 's not the bad master here `` , and then he laughs , but it really `` web master `` . grad f : web master . grad d : oh . { comment } uh - oh . postdoc a : and then you see another type of uncertainty which is , you know , they just did n't know what to make out of that . so instead of `` split upon unknown `` , { comment } it 's `` split in principle `` . grad d : jane , these are from ibm ? grad f : spit upon ? grad d : the top lines ? postdoc a : no , no . these are these are our local transcriptions of the nsa meetings . grad f : no , these are ours . postdoc a : the transcribers transcriber 's version ver versus the checked version . grad d : oh . oh , i see . postdoc a : my my checked version , after i go through it . um , then you get down here . um . sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms . that 's the next example , the next one . the , uh , version beyond this is so instead of saying `` or `` , especially those words , `` also `` and `` oder `` and some other ones . those sneak in . um , the next one grad f : that 's cool . phd h : discourse markers . discourse markers . postdoc a : sorry , what ? discourse markers ? sure . sure , sure , sure . phd h : discourse markers . postdoc a : and it 's and it makes sense phd h : yeah . yeah . postdoc a : cuz it 's , like , below this it 's a little subliminal there . phd h : yeah . yeah , yeah . postdoc a : um . ok , the next one , uh , this is a term . the problem with terminology . description with th the transcriber has `` x as an advance `` . but really it 's `` qs in advance `` . i mean , i i 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings . ok , then you got , um , uh , instead of `` from something - or - other cards `` , { comment } it 's `` for multicast `` . and instead of `` ann system related `` , it 's `` end system related `` . this was changed to an acronym initially and it should should n't have been . and then , you can see here `` gps `` was misinterpreted . it 's just totally understanda this is this is a lot of jargon . um , and the final one , the transcriber had th `` in the core network itself or the exit unknown , not the internet unknown `` . and it it comes through as `` in the core network itself of the access provider , not the internet backbone core `` . now this is a lot of terminology . and they 're generally extremely good , but , you know in this this area it really does pay to , um to double check and i 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance cuz the you know , there 're a lot of these in there . phd h : yeah . so how often ? grad f : yeah , but i bet i bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though . postdoc a : no , actually no . huh - uh . grad f : oh , really ? uh , it 's oh , so it 's just jargon . postdoc a : it 's jargon . yeah . i mean this is cuz , you know you do n't realize in daily life how much you have top - down influences in what you 're hearing . phd h : well , but postdoc a : and it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent . phd h : but but but we do n't i mean , our language model right now does n't know about these words anyhow . so , professor b : yeah . phd h : you know , un until you actually get a decent language model , @ @ { comment } adam 's right . grad f : it probably wo n't do any better . phd h : you probably wo n't notice a difference . but it 's i mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed . i mean , obviously . postdoc a : well , also from the standpoint of getting people 's approval , professor b : yeah . postdoc a : cuz if someone sees a page full of uh , um , barely decipherable w you know , sentences , and then is asked to approve of it or not , it 's , uh , uh grad f : did i say that ? professor b : yeah . yeah . that would be a shame if people said `` well , i do n't approve it because the it 's not what i said `` . grad f : well , that 's exactly why i put the extra option in , professor b : yeah . postdoc a : exactly . that 's why we discussed that . professor b : yeah . grad f : is that i was afraid people would say , `` let 's censor that because it 's wrong `` , professor b : yeah . grad f : and i do n't want them to do that . postdoc a : and then i also the final thing i have for transcription is that i made a purchase of some other headphones because of the problem of low gain in the originals . and and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones , and actually i i mean , i i think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the the choice . we 'd originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headsets grad f : yeah . ugh ! postdoc a : but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this with this respect to this particular task . phd h : well , return the old ones . grad f : it 's probably impedance matching problems . postdoc a : i do n't know exactly , grad f : but postdoc a : but we chose them because that 's what 's been used here by prominent projects in transcription . professor b : could be . postdoc a : so it i we had every reason to think they would work . grad f : mm - hmm . phd h : so you have spare headsets ? postdoc a : sorry , what ? phd h : you have spare headsets ? grad f : they 're just earphones . they 're not headsets . they 're not microphones . phd e : right . phd h : no , no . i mean , just earphones ? um , because i , uh , i could use one on my workstation , just to t because sometimes i have to listen to audio files and i do n't have to b go borrow it from someone and postdoc a : we have actua actually i have w well , the thing is , that if we have four people come to work for a day , i was i was hanging on to the others for , eh for spares , phd h : oh , ok . postdoc a : but i can tell you what i recommend . professor b : no , but you 'd if you yeah , w we should get it . phd h : sure . no problem . grad f : but if you need it , just get it . phd h : i just grad f : come on . phd h : right . professor b : yeah . if you need it . phd h : yeah . professor b : yeah . postdoc a : it 'd just have to be a s a separate order an added order . grad d : yeah , i still i still need to get a pair , too . professor b : they 're they 're they 're they 're pretty inexpensive . phd e : yeah , that we should order a cou uh , t two or three or four , actually . professor b : yeah . grad d : i 'm using one of these . yeah . phd e : we have phd h : i think i have a pair that i brought from home , but it 's f just for music listening professor b : no . just just just just buy them . phd e : sh - just get the model number phd h : and it 's not nnn . yeah . professor b : just buy them . phd e : and where do you buy these from ? phd h : yeah . postdoc a : cambridge soundworks , just down the street . phd e : like ? you just b go and b postdoc a : yeah . they always have them in stock . professor b : yeah . phd e : that 'd be a good idea . phd h : anyway . professor b : yeah . grad f : w uh , could you email out the brand ? postdoc a : oh , sure . yeah . ok . grad f : cuz i think sounds like people are interested . grad d : yeah . professor b : yeah . grad d : definitely . postdoc a : it 's made a difference in in how easy . yeah . professor b : i realized something i should talk about . so what 's the other thing on the agenda actually ? grad f : uh , the only one was don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again . grad d : yeah . u it 's short . i mean , if you wan na go , we can just throw it in at the end . professor b : no , no . why do n't you why do n't you go ahead since it 's short . grad d : um , well , uh . grad f : oh , i thought you meant the disk space . yeah , we know disk space is short . phd h : the disk space was short . yeah . that 's what i thought too . phd e : that 's a great ambiguity . professor b : yeah . phd e : it 's one of these it 's it 's social professor b : it 's i i i it i phd e : and , uh , discourse level grad d : yeah . phd e : and professor b : yeah , it 's great . yeah , phd e : sorry . professor b : double double grad f : yeah , it was really goo phd e : see , if i had that little scratch - pad , i would have made an x there . grad d : thank you , thank you . grad f : uh , well , we 'll give you one then . professor b : yeah . grad d : um . so , um , without thinking about it , when i offered up my hard drive last week grad f : oh , no . grad d : um , this is always a suspect phrase . phd e : it was while i was out of town . grad d : but , um , no . i , uh i realized that we 're going to be doing a lot of experiments , um , o for this , uh , paper we 're writing , so we 're probably gon na need a lot more we 're probably gon na need that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive . but , um , we also have someone else coming in that 's gon na help us out with some stuff . professor b : we 've just ordered a hundred gigabytes . grad d : so ok . we just need to phd e : i think we need , like , another eighteen gig disk to be safe . professor b : well , we 're getting three thirty thirty - sixes . right ?

professor b : i thought we did . grad f : did we ? ok . phd h : yeah . we did . grad f : ok . so now now we have the schedule . so next week we 'll do automatic transcription status , plus anything that 's real timely . phd e : oh . ok . professor b : ok . whew ! phd c : good update . grad f : whew ! professor b : that was grad f : dodged that bullet . professor b : yeah . nicely done , liz . postdoc a : a woman of few words . professor b : but but lots of prosody . ok . ok . phd h : uh , i mean , we we really have n't done anything . grad f : excuse me ? phd h : sorry . postdoc a : well , since last week . phd e : yeah , we 're phd h : i mean , the the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the , um the automatic alignments because , uh , i got some i i i learned from thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we 're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech or , of the foreground speech with background speech . grad f : yeah . phd e : and then , uh , i guess , the new data that don will start to process phd h : but , we have n't actually phd e : the , um when he can get these you know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous and that caused a lot of problems because you have timed sp at on either side . grad f : oh . right , right . mm - hmm . phd e : and so that 's sort of a stage - two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step . grad f : right . postdoc a : i 'll be interested . phd e : we did get our , um i guess , good news . we got our abstract accepted for this conference , um workshop , isca workshop , in , um , uh , new jersey . and we sent in a very poor abstract , but they very poor , very quick . um , but we 're hoping to have a paper for that as well , which should be an interesting grad f : when 's it due ? phd e : the t paper is n't due until august . the abstracts were already due . so it 's that kind of workshop . grad f : mm - hmm . phd e : but , i mean , the good news is that that will have sort of the european experts in prosody sort of a different crowd , and i think we 're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far , so that should be interesting . postdoc a : what 's the name of the meeting ? phd e : uh , it 's isca workshop on prosody in speech recognition and understanding , or something like that phd h : it 's called prosody to grad f : mm - hmm . postdoc a : good . phd e : some generic uh , so it 's focused on using prosody in automatic systems and there 's a um , a web page for it . professor b : y you going to , uh , eurospeech ?
