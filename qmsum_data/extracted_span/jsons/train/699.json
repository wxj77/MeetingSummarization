    "answer": "phd a : so we would be looking at , um , the variance of the spectrum of the excitation , phd f : uh , um , this , this , and this . phd a : something like this , which is should be high for voiced sounds . uh , we phd c : wait a minute . i what does that mean ? the variance of the spectrum of excitation . phd a : yeah . so the so basically the spectrum of the excitation for a purely periodic sig signal shou sh professor b : ok . yeah , w what yo what you 're calling the excitation , as i recall , is you 're subtracting the the , um the mel mel mel filter , uh , spectrum from the fft spectrum . phd a : e that 's right . yeah . so professor b : right . phd a : yeah . phd f : mm - hmm . phd a : so we have the mel f filter bank , we have the fft , so we just professor b : so it 's it 's not really an excitation , but it 's something that hopefully tells you something about the excitation . phd a : yeah , that 's right . professor b : yeah , yeah . phd a : um yeah . phd f : we have here some histogram , phd a : e yeah , phd f : but they have a lot of overlap . phd a : but it 's it 's still yeah . so , well , for unvoiced portion we have something tha that has a mean around o point three , and for voiced portion the mean is o point fifty - nine . but the variance seem quite high . phd c : how do you know ? phd a : so mmm . phd c : how did you get your voiced and unvoiced truth data ? phd a : we used , uh , timit and we used canonical mappings between the phones phd f : yeah . we , uh , use timit on this , for phd a : th yeah . phd f : but if we look at it in one sentence , it apparently it 's good , i think . phd a : yeah , but yeah . uh , so it 's noisy timit . that 's right . yeah . grad e : it 's noisy timit . phd f : yeah . phd a : it seems quite robust to noise , so when we take we draw its parameters across time for a clean sentence and then nois the same noisy sentence , it 's very close . professor b : mm - hmm . phd a : yeah . so there are there is this . there could be also the , um something like the maximum of the auto - correlation function or which phd c : is this a a s a trained system ? or is it a system where you just pick some thresholds ? ho - how does it work ? phd a : right now we just are trying to find some features . and , phd c : mm - hmm . phd a : uh yeah . hopefully , i think what we want to have is to put these features in s some kind of , um well , to to obtain a statistical model on these features and to or just to use a neural network and hopefully these features w would help phd c : because it seems like what you said about the mean of the the voiced and the unvoiced { comment } that seemed pretty encouraging . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : well , yeah , except the variance was big . phd c : right ? phd a : yeah . except the variance is quite high . professor b : right ? phd c : well , y phd a : yeah . phd c : well , y i i do n't know that i would trust that so much because you 're doing these canonical mappings from timit labellings . phd a : uh - huh . phd c : right ? so , really that 's sort of a cartoon picture about what 's voiced and unvoiced . so that could be giving you a lot of variance . phd a : yeah . phd c : i mean , i it it may be that that you 're finding something good and that the variance is sort of artificial because of how you 're getting your truth ."
