    "query": "<s> what does the group think of the eas consortium 's approach to using the looked-after and adopted pdg as part of a broader approach targeted at vulnerable learners ?",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : i 'm a great believer in if we can get it right for our most vulnerable learners , we 'll be getting it right for all of our learners . i gave the example earlier , for instance , of attachment disorder , and , chair , you will know that i have had conversations . one of the emerging themes for me , as i go around visiting schools , is the impact and the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder , and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children . so , for instance , as i said about carmarthenshire , there 's been a huge effort to address that in the school sector in carmarthenshire . now , that has a disproportionate benefit for those children , because you 're more likely to see attachment disorder in children who are care experienced , because of the nature of the lives that those children have lived , but that does n't necessarily mean that attachment disorder is exclusively found in those children that are looked after . it can be found in other families as well . so , that vulnerable learner , regardless of their background , will benefit from having teachers who are better trained , understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need . steve davies : i think it 's also important to add that this is not one region 's approach ; this is across four regions , so the others\u2014 . for example , erw have run a significant programme looking at the impact of adverse childhood experiences on pupils , which has enabled teachers to detect some of the impact of some of those and then considers some of the work they need to do within the school but also with other agencies . so , it is something that's applied consistently across the four regions . kirsty williams am : i was in pil primary school recently where they use their pdg , both fsm pdg , and no doubt an element of pdg for looked-after , for nurture groups . so , for those children who really , really find it very difficult to be in the main classroom , they can have that nurture group experience to address issues around emotional behaviour , feelings , and it gets them in a position where they are able then to join the main classroom because issues around behaviour have been addressed and they 're in a better position to learn . so , again , this is an example of how vulnerable learners in the wider sense can benefit ."
