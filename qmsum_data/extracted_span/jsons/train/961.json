    "answer": "mr. terry dowdall : okay . i 'm going to switch it over . canadians in my riding who suffer from cystic fibrosis are among the most vulnerable to covid-19 infection . while these canadians with existing lung conditions are incredibly worried about a virus that attacks the ability to breathe , the good news is that there are life-saving medicines for those with cf . the problem is with the patented medicine prices review board and its restrictive guidelines . i am wondering if and when the government will correct these guidelines and give access to life-saving medicines for our most vulnerable . hon . patty hajdu ( minister of health ) : mr . chair , as you know , the government has been very committed to improving access and affordability for prescription medications for all canadians . the pmprb regulatory amendments will help canadians be able to afford their prescriptions , and canada will continue to be an important market for new medicines . in fact , many countries with much lower medicine prices gained access to new medicines in the same time frame as canada frame , or even faster , so we are excited to do this work . mr. terry dowdall : mr . chair , our seniors are being particularly hard hit right now during this pandemic , yet seniors have not been given any direct support . it 's one of the number one calls i 'm getting in my office . funding to charities like the united way is being labelled as support for seniors , but most wo n't see any of this support . seniors in my riding have asked for an increase in their cpp and oas , and to be able to make untaxed bulk withdrawals from their rrsps while they still have some value . can the minister confirm when these real and direct supports for seniors will be forthcoming ? hon . deb schulte ( minister of seniors ) : i want to assure the honourable member and canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic . he mentioned . i 'm not quite sure what 's happening with my machine . i apologize . the chair : you might want to try your space bar and keep it down while you 're speaking . that might solve the problem . hon . deb schulte : okay , i 'll try that . thank you very much . i want to assure the honourable member and canadians that our government has been working extremely hard on how best to support and serve seniors during this pandemic . we have introduced a supplementary gst payment for low- and modest-income seniors . we 've reduced the minimum rrif withdrawal by 25 % , and we 've made the cerb available to working seniors who have lost their jobs due to the covid pandemic . we know there 's more work to do , and we 'll have more to say in the future ."
