    "answer": "grad f : and that 's just what i used to generate the order . of these particular ones . phd d : oh ! great . great . professor c : so , i 'm impressed by what we could do , is take the standard training set for ti - digits , train up with whatever , you know , great features we think we have , uh for instance , and then test on uh this test set . grad f : um professor c : and presumably uh it should do reasonably well on that , and then , presumably , we should go to the distant mike , and it should do poorly . phd d : yeah . professor c : and then we should get really smart over the next year or two , and it that should get better . grad f : right . and inc increase it by one or two percent , yeah . professor c : yeah , yeah . grad f : um , but , in order to do that we need to extract out the actual digits . professor c : right . grad f : um , so that the reason it 's not just a transcript is that there 're false starts , and misreads , and miscues and things like that . and so i have a set of scripts and x waves where you just select the portion , hit r , um , it tells you what the next one should be , and you just look for that . you know , so it it 'll put on the screen , `` the next set is six nine , nine two two `` . and you find that , and , hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format . professor c : so is this grad f : and so the the question is , should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ? well , some of us . i 've been do i 've done , eight meetings , something like that , just by hand . just myself , rather . so it will not take long . um professor c : uh , what what do you think ? postdoc b : my feeling is that we discussed this right before coffee and i think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , um , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them . and also it is contributing to the , uh , c composition of the transcript cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it 'll be a more complete transcript . so i 'm i think it 's fine , that part . grad f : there is there is professor c : so you think it 's fine to have the transcribers do it ? postdoc b : mm - hmm . professor c : yeah , ok . grad f : there 's one other small bit , which is just entering the information which at s which is at the top of this form , onto the computer , to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically . phd d : good . professor c : yeah . grad f : and so it 's just , you know , typing in name , times time , date , and so on . um , which again either they can do , but it is , you know , firing up an editor , or , again , i can do . or someone else can do . postdoc b : and , that , you know , i 'm not , that that one i 'm not so sure if it 's into the the , things that , i , wanted to use the hours for , because the , the time that they 'd be spending doing that they would n't be able to be putting more words on . but that 's really your choice , it 's your phd d : so are these two separate tasks that can happen ? or do they have to happen at the same time before grad f : no they do n't have this you have to enter the data before , you do the second task , but they do n't have to happen at the same time . so it 's it 's just i have a file whi which has this information on it , and then when you start using my scripts , for extracting the times , it adds the times at the bottom of the file . and so , um , i mean , it 's easy to create the files and leave them blank , and so actually we could do it in either order . phd d : oh , ok . grad f : um , it 's it 's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double - check , to make sure you 're entering for the right person . but , either way . professor c : yeah . yeah just by way of uh , uh , a uh , order of magnitude , uh , um , we 've been working with this aurora , uh data set . and , uh , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , uh , is about , uh i think the best score was something like five percent , uh , error , per digit . phd a : per digit . professor c : so , that grad f : per digit . professor c : you 're right . so if you were doing ten digit , uh , recognition , you would really be in trouble . so so the the point there , and this is uh car noise uh , uh things , but but real real situation , phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : well , `` real `` , um , the uh there 's one microphone that 's close , that they have as as this sort of thing , close versus distant . uh but in a car , instead of instead of having a projector noise it 's it 's car noise . uh but it was n't artificially added to get some some artificial signal - to - noise ratio . it was just people driving around in a car . so , that 's that 's an indication , uh that was with , many sites competing , and this was the very best score and so forth , so . more typical numbers like phd d : although the models were n't , that good , right ? i mean , the models are pretty crappy ? professor c : you 're right . i think that we could have done better on the models , but the thing is that we got this this is the kind of typical number , for all of the , uh , uh , things in this task , all of the , um , languages . and so i i think we 'd probably the models would be better in some than in others . um , so , uh . anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard . postdoc b : hmm . it 's gon na be fun to see how we , compare at this . very exciting . s @ @ . professor c : yeah . phd d : how did we do on the ti - digits ? grad f : well the prosodics are so much different s it 's gon na be , strange . i mean the prosodics are not the same as ti - digits , for example . professor c : yeah . grad f : so i 'm i 'm not sure how much of effect that will have . phd d : h how do phd g : what do you mean , the prosodics ? grad f : um , just what we were talking about with grouping . that with these , the grouping , there 's no grouping at all , and so it 's just the only sort of discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end . phd g : so what are they doing in aurora , are they reading actual phone numbers , grad f : aurora i do n't know . i do n't know what they do in aurora . phd g : or , a a digit at a time , or ? professor c : uh , i 'm not sure how phd g : cuz it 's professor c : no , no i mean it 's connected it 's connected , uh , digits , phd g : connected . professor c : yeah . but . grad f : but right . phd g : so there 's also the not just the prosody but the cross the cross - word modeling is probably quite different . grad f : but in ti - digits , they 're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that , phd g : right . phd d : do we do on ti - digits ? grad f : so it 's gon na be different . i do n't remember . i mean , very good , right ? professor c : yeah , i mean we were in the . grad f : one and a half percent , two percent , something like that ? professor c : uh , i th no i think we got under a percent , but it was but it 's but i mean . the very best system that i saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at at bell labs , or . uh , but . but , uh , sort of pulling out all the stops . grad f : oh really ? postdoc b : s @ @ . it s strikes me that there are more each of them is more informative because it 's so , random , grad f : ok . alright . professor c : but i think a lot of systems sort of get half a percent , or three - quarters a percent , grad f : right . professor c : and we 're we 're in there somewhere . grad f : but that i mean it 's really it 's it 's close - talking mikes , no noise , clean signal , just digits , i mean , every everything is good . professor c : yeah . phd g : it 's the beginning of time in speech recognition . grad f : yes , exactly . professor c : yeah . grad f : and we 've only recently got it to anywhere near human . phd g : it 's like the , single cell , you know , it 's the beginning of life , phd d : pre - prehistory . phd g : yeah . grad f : and it 's still like an order of magnitude worse than what humans do . phd g : right . professor c : yeah . when when they 're wide awake , yeah . um , grad f : yeah . after coffee . professor c : after coffee , you 're right . not after lunch . grad f : ok , so , um , what i 'll do then is i 'll go ahead and enter , this data . and then , hand off to jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits . professor c : yeah . yeah . one question i have that that i mean , we would n't know the answer to now but might , do some guessing , but i was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti uh , uh , marking of articulatory , features , with overlap and so on . and , and , um , on some subset . one thought might be to do this uh , on on the digits , or some piece of the digits . uh , it 'd be easier , uh , and so forth . the only thing is i 'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena , in w i i the reason for doing it is because the the argument is that certainly with conversational speech , the stuff that we 've looked at here before , um , just doing the simple mapping , from , um , the phone , to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book , uh , is n't right . it is n't actually right . in fact there 's these overlapping processes where some voicing some up and then some , you know , some nasality is comes in here , and so forth . and you do this gross thing saying `` well i guess it 's this phone starting there `` . so , uh , that 's the reasoning . but , it could be that when we 're reading digits , because it 's it 's for such a limited set , that maybe maybe that phenomenon does n't occur as much . i do n't know . di - an anybody ? do you have any ? anybody have any opinion about that , postdoc b : and that people might articulate more , and you that might end up with more a closer correspondence . professor c : mm - hmm . yeah . grad f : yeah that 's i i agree . phd d : sort of less predictability , grad f : that it 's just postdoc b : mm - hmm . professor c : yeah . phd d : and you hafta grad f : it 's a well would , this corpus really be the right one to even try that on ?"
