industrial designer : and but then i w i would marketing : spongey . industrial designer : i would do the arrows here , kind of thing . marketing : spongey can be reached by means of industrial designer : those buttons ? and the simple buttons here , user interface : . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so that user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . and and the and the control thngs in the middle ? the the the arrows ? industrial designer : i uh y eah that 's what i mean . user interface : no the arrow 's over here . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the arrows over here , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and here the s simple uh marketing : yeah and then numbers . project manager : buttons . okay . marketing : yeah . alright . project manager : i think that uh it 's a nice design . marketing : uh pretty nice design . yeah . industrial designer : project manager : it 's cool . marketing : yeah it looks uh pretty fancy . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or do we wan na make its shape look like a banana or something ? user interface : industrial designer : i dunno . marketing : . project manager : yeah that 's user interface : marketing : uh bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so it 's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours . industrial designer : yeah we could make marketing : i do n't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? like some soft green or something ? project manager : orange or something . marketing : or and then user interface : or blue ? dark blue or marketing : oh yeah yeah , dark blue industrial designer : we should use marketing : and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , user interface : yeah . marketing : with very uh bright tones i guess . industrial designer : yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . marketing : so you have something like project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the leds on the on the remote control . industrial designer : yeah . yeah okay yeah . user interface : if you we uh yeah . if you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it 's just a neutral colour , project manager : user interface : also for the for the more uh yeah for the people . project manager : huh cool . marketing : mm . that does n't really work . to draw , i guess . project manager : no it 's . marketing : oh . what 's this ? project manager : yeah it 's text . user interface : marketing : right . project manager : n no you have to exit . you could also make line with uh user interface : so that 's marketing : yeah . two hours further . project manager : yeah . marketing : thickness . oh . user interface : so that 's blue . marketing : oh . wh why not go for the twenty ? user interface : project manager : mm . yeah . marketing : yeah . that 's what i call painting . project manager : y marketing : so that 's that 's a dark blue basic colour i guess . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah and then on top of that . marketing : it 's pretty nice . and then uh oh project manager : some yellow . marketing : yeah with some some yellow banana project manager : banana colour . industrial designer : and how about some uh some flashing standby lights ? marketing : like . industrial designer : like you have on the samsung , well i do n't like to call brands phones , marketing : industrial designer : the you know that 'cause i remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often . marketing : yeah ? industrial designer : so it not not only in in the colours of the leds , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or marketing : how do you mean ? project manager : yeah if you if flashing colour so you ca n't lose it , basically . industrial designer : um user interface : yeah . marketing : some some industrial designer : yeah . exactly . project manager : well i think it 's a bit too much but user interface : maybe a industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah an orange . well alright well this is more like purple i guess , project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : but it 's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so uh yeah . that would be a nice uh nice device i guess . user interface : and which which colour should uh should i give the the display ? uh or marketing : i mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : ah well i do n't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive . project manager : and then you can use yellow or semething . why not ? aye . user interface : yeah . marketing : so just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that . user interface : mm . yeah . marketing : green is too old-fashioned . but blue , blue 's okay . j industrial designer : as long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . project manager : like this . user interface : maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? industrial designer : so that people with uh with marketing : white backlight , and dark . user interface : dark uh letters , yeah . marketing : yeah . whatever which is visible . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : i know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . i mean it 's hard to tell uh i dunno . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and also for people who are a bit colourblind . project manager : colourblind yeah . marketing : yeah . true . project manager : no so that 's mostly red and green i believe . marketing : which which uh colour should the buttons be ? user interface : that 's adjustable . project manager : woah . all all buttons ? marketing : why adjustable ? user interface : yeah ? or not . project manager : okay . marketing : no uh user interface : that 's how we are going to make it uh more trendy . or is it uh too expensive ? marketing : but maybe i mean they have to they have to have some colour right ? project manager : it 's difficult . marketing : and if the background is very dark blue project manager : blue . maybe green . industrial designer : but do n't we wan na make the background the the bright colo colours ? so th the total of the thing is very bright ? project manager : yeah you can industrial designer : like the pictures i showed you guys . those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy . marketing : yeah ? project manager : mm-hmm flashy . marketing : so more like project manager : mm bzz . marketing : does n't work very well . uh . more like this colour . industrial designer : yeah something like that , something that stands out more . marketing : and then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? the the press buttons . should they be white or black or project manager : red maybe . user interface : and it it looks quite cheap , that colour i think . marketing : uh project manager : black . user interface : it 's it 's not industrial designer : the green ? user interface : yeah . i dunno . marketing : yeah but it 's pretty fresh , on the other side . project manager : yeah . so industrial designer : it 's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment . user interface : it 's it 's trendy okay . but marketing : yeah . my couch is in that colour . project manager : ooh . . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : well it works pretty well . project manager : marketing : and then time was up . project manager : uh not yet . marketing : uh industrial designer : do you get a pop-up if we marketing : . project manager : yeah within five minutes yeah . marketing : that you have five minutes left or industrial designer : alright . project manager : y left yeah left and then uh i have to kick you out . marketing : so something like this . user interface : yeah . marketing : that should be pretty nice colour . but maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . project manager : yeah yeah . industrial designer : no that 's actu marketing : because the of the green . user interface : but the but the buttons have their own leds or not ? project manager : they have leds but they have a colour . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . even for colourblind . marketing : yeah ? industrial designer : they will see one of each as grey . but if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same . marketing : yeah . project manager : user interface : okay . marketing : okay . industrial designer : i think . marketing : so red buttons are okay ? industrial designer : i think so . project manager : you can make them red . user interface : okay . that that 's a default uh setting . the the red buttons . project manager : yeah . but i think you need to keep in mind that the leds are just extra light . marketing : how do you mean ? project manager : uh they they do n't determine the colour that much , i think . marketing : yeah . user interface : okay . yeah i i was think about a red uh red leds and blue leds and project manager : 'cause you have to print on them you have a background marketing : no that 's that 's too busy i guess . user interface : yeah . project manager : each number is transparent . user interface : yeah . project manager : uh partly but you have to print on the number . or the the sign . user interface : okay . project manager : so you ca n't change the colour so marketing : you better bet better better keep the led and the button itself in the same colour i guess . project manager : yeah . user interface : okay . marketing : so just an extra project manager : bit of light . industrial designer : you can marketing : bit of light and attention . project manager : bit of feedback . industrial designer : what we should do i think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured led behind it . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so that the whole button will shine project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : as the colour the and if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it 's easy to hold f for both hands , marketing : industrial designer : but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay with uh do n't mean to discourage you but uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . next thirty minutes to design something so industrial designer : ah , right . marketing : alright . project manager : and the you will do the evaluation . marketing : of the product ? project manager : yeah . marketing : which we do n't have yet . project manager : yeah uh about user interface : marketing : so wh how should i do that ? project manager : yeah i do n't know . you probably get a mail . marketing : oh okay . or you you or you send it to me . or just project manager : yeah . once they are finished . yeah . marketing : because you are going to design it on this board right ? project manager : yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you do n't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . i do n't know . marketing : yeah . i i probably get instruction on that , how to do that , project manager : yeah . marketing : so i make another presentation i guess . project manager : yeah . marketing : i kn i know what 's gon na happen in in yeah so project manager : about . yeah . you have the basic idea . marketing : i 've a basic idea . project manager : and you two uh are going to do this . look-and-feel and user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so we 're gon na work here ? on this sketchboard ? project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : good luck . industrial designer : alright . thanks . marketing : yeah . alright so that 's uh project manager : so i uh make new page and uh be creative . marketing : yeah . user interface : but we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ?
