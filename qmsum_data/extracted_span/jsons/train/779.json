    "query": "<s> what did kirsty williams think of the grading system and its fairness ?",
    "answer": "dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . you touched on this once or twice in answers to questions about how rigorous the qualification is . we 've had mixed evidence , i would suggest , from groups of stakeholders . we 've heard people say that the welsh bac has no rigour , that pupils are spoon-fed . we 've heard that the welsh bac is passively marked , the grades are inflated , that there 's little rigour in the sampling and moderation , there 's a confusion about how the scc is graded , and i know that 's something you talked about , actually , that introducing the grading system is improving the rigour . i suppose my question to you is : if the welsh bac is being seen in this way by stakeholders , how are going to address that ? to what extent is that a real problem ? kirsty williams am : i think making it a graded qualification has been really important , and i make no apologies for this qualification being rigorous\u2014no apologies for that at all . that 's how it should be , and that 's how you create value , by ensuring that a qualification is rigorous . what 's really important is that it 's not just me saying that it 's rigorous ; there is an independent process that benchmarks qualifications . the fact is that at advanced level\u2014because i do n't know if you 're making these observations about the pre-16 welsh bac , or whether we 're talking about the advanced level qualification\u2014that is the equivalent of an a-level . it 's been benchmarked against a-levels . it has a ucas tariff associated with it . it is used by universities as a means of qualification that gains entrance into a university in just the same way as an a-level is . so , therefore , i do n't have any concerns about the rigour of the qualification . in terms of spoon-feeding , one of the reasons why universities like the qualification is that it 's very difficult , for instance , in the individual project work to be spoon-fed . it is very demanding of individual students , and it 's very difficult in a way . that 's one of the reasons why it 's valuable , is n't it , because it teaches a different set of skills ? because if you 're doing a traditional , say , history a-level or a science a-level , there 's a very strict syllabus and a course , there 's a textbook and people are taught to that particular syllabus ; with the welsh bac , it is individual students that have to think , for instance , of their own individual project . you ca n't get those off a shelf , and you ca n't necessarily just find that information easily . there 's real skill involved in being able to do that well and get graded well for that . so , i do not have concerns about the rigour . i do have concerns about some of the feedback by qualifications wales about the onerousness of the evaluation and what that means for teacher workload , which is one of the things that qualifications wales is looking at . but in terms of rigour and people being spoon-fed , then i do n't share those concerns . dawn bowden am : okay , because those were concerns , in the main , that were articulated by people delivering the welsh bac\u2014by teachers . so , i suppose the question then comes back to some of the other points that were being raised about the consistency , because that may well be from those teachers in schools where they 're not taking the bac as seriously as some others are . kirsty williams am : and , of course , there would be\u2014 . there is a professional responsibility for those teachers delivering that qualification to ensure that the ethos of that qualification and the skills\u2014 . it would potentially be a disservice to students if that qualification was being delivered in that way . dawn bowden am : and i think what i was trying to do was to highlight the different opinions , because we also heard from teachers who were saying that those involved with teaching and studying understood absolutely its rigour , so it was the mixed message , i guess , i was just trying to test out with you . similarly , on the skills challenge certificate , again we 've heard from various stakeholders about whether , in fact , this is considered to be an equivalent qualification . we 've heard people say that it is different\u2014it 's not the same as an a-level\u2014so , therefore you ca n't absolutely hold it up and say it 's the same as an a-level . it requires different skills , and so on and so forth . so , just your thoughts and views on that , really , as an equivalent qualification ."
