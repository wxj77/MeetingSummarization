    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about user requirements of the new remote control ?",
    "answer": "marketing : okay , so um we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . we asked some uh open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there 's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group . project manager : okay . marketing : okay . so we got some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost . i often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it 's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . i remember trying to load a d_v_d_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me i do n't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , you know there 's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . and if they do , not very often . takes too long to master the remote control . i 've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they 're just not great to use . we just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . some of the good stuff we got . between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . now do n't get excited yet , i 've got more to say on that . most people 'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . finally , my opinion . the voice recognition thing is cool . and uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . it 's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you 're not gon na get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many , you ca n't have that many words . for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . i 'm pretty sure people would buy it . but after a while people may wan na return it , because if you have to to say som i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that 's for flickering through channels . so if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it . however , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there 's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . but if we do have the voice recognition thing , there 's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . see , you could there 're two options . either you have voice recognition by itself , which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wan na be watching television and you wan na be quiet , or i do n't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote 's only trained for you , it 's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . as long as the voice recognition stuff works , that 's that 's fine . project manager : okay , yep . marketing : so we have the three birds , we have the design , that we have the the fancy bit , right , the voice recognition 's fancy , it 's cool , it 's different , it 's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit i do n't remember so i 'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , i think is a big question . um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it 'll take to train the remote , 'cause i think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control . and uh what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wan na use the tv , they ca n't use the remote because they speak differently to you . um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . uh , will people return the remote control , i think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so , project manager : mm-hmm . if you could uh marketing : do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it 's not as fast as pressing a button , it 's not a practical . so . these are things i think we should consider . i think it 's cool , project manager : if you could speed it up a bit , yeah . if you could uh speed it up a bit please , yeah . marketing : i 'm sorry ? sure . project manager : sorry . marketing : i 'm about to end , yeah . project manager : cool . marketing : i think it 's cool but there are definitely some considerations . project manager : okay . excellent ."
