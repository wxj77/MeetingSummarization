marketing : industrial designer : uh it 's i most cats are small . project manager : oh , okay . industrial designer : you can handle them . project manager : okay . okay . okay , user interface : marketing : project manager : and then we are uh through the tool training , i guess . user interface : okay . industrial designer : marketing : i would n't call it training , but project manager : okay , this is uh something about the project finance . the selling price of our remote control is gon na be twenty five euros . and our profit aim is fifteen million euros . we 're very ambitious on this one . user interface : project manager : the market range is international , so it 's gon na be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve euro fifty per remote control . so that 's clear . yeah ? user interface : okay . marketing : alright . project manager : okay , we 're now gon na discuss some stuff when well , we 're gon na brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it 's gon na be . uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls ? or do they annoy you sometimes ? are they difficult to understand , or maybe they do n't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ? marketing : i do n't th i do n't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , project manager : yeah , okay . marketing : but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new tv because their previous one was stolen or whatever . user interface : different . project manager : okay . marketing : and then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . uh , so i think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons , you know . all th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh project manager : different functions of of uh marketing : well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else . project manager : okay . yeah . marketing : i think we should group them . project manager : okay . marketing : and same for the for the volume buttons and the the t project manager : and uh , is it gon na be a remote control that 's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your tv and your home stereo ? marketing : well i was i was thinking uh since a tv is uh mostly used together with a v_c_r_ or d_v_d_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , i think it should be good to include functions for v_c_r_s and d_v_d_ players , recorders . project manager : uh user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . but uh , the d_v_d_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's what , from my experience . user interface : but is n't it marketing : i do n't know . hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as i know of in combination with television . project manager : okay . but we gon na user interface : it 's only for television , i thought . not marketing : yes . project manager : oh , it is only for televis user interface : i thought it was only for television . so so we probably do n't have to have to uh have the functions for d_v_d_ player or v_c_r_ . marketing : yes , it is only for television , but uh project manager : so wha what what wha what uh what document marketing : well well we we 're gon na brainstorm about that . if we think it 's useful , we do it . project manager : but , where where did it uh where did you find that ? user interface : uh , in the email . project manager : oh , okay . user interface : i thought it said uh marketing : that 's right . it 's a television remote control . user interface : yeah , television remote control . industrial designer : yes , marketing : but i was thinking since it is useful with d_v_d_ project manager : yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . so we can industrial designer : yes , that 's uh something extras . project manager : no , we have to think about that . user interface : true . yeah . project manager : okay , uh but uh we 've gon na put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or user interface : true . yeah , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , also no one 's gon na buy it . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . true . industrial designer : only the experts . marketing : i guess . project manager : well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . marketing : yeah . project manager : that w well , then you 're you 're the usability uh man , so this uh gon na be a very important task for you then . user interface : oh my god . okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . well , other ideas ? how can we make it trendy or something ? do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ? industrial designer : uh , to go with to go with fashion and project manager : maybe a can opener underneath it ? user interface : for the bear . uh industrial designer : marketing : project manager : i do n't know . or someth something special , like uh m_p_ three player inside of it , or uh user interface : i i uh , no i think it project manager : oh , well then the production costs are gon na be too high probably . user interface : uh , i th i think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . marketing : yeah , way too high . yep . project manager : okay . maybe with different type of fronts or uh user interface : it 's international , so we have to use a standard . project manager : well , m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it marketing : well that 's an idea of course , yeah . project manager : we gon na skip back to the goals probably . uh , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : original , trendly , and user-friendly well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . no , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand i guess . when something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , marketing : yeah . project manager : or we should make it combination of that . 'kay , so you the um technical part of the process is something you 're gon na look after for , so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . well , and that 's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it . user interface : use friendly . yep . project manager : well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . well , you know , y like some special feature . or some does it does it gets some gadgetness or something . marketing : yeah . yes , what the market wishes . project manager : okay . well , the closing . next meeting starts in thirty minutes . individual , i think so . the the industrial designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh already s said that . the user interface designer is it a user inter user interface user interface : yeah . yeah , yeah . interface d marketing : yeah . project manager : the technical functions design . and the management expert of uh the marketing expert . user requirements specifi well , this one was already clear to us . specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . i do n't know how much time we have left . marketing : project manager : oh , not many i guess . we started at twelve . marketing : you just got a message . project manager : oh , and what does it said ? marketing : and it said uh five minutes , so we got four and a half . user interface : oh , i do n't project manager : w okay , well um user interface : i did n't get a message . marketing : no . he 's the whatever . user interface : oh , the project manager . industrial designer : team leader . project manager : no , we 're uh ahead of schedule then . marketing : team leader . he is the whatever . project manager : yeah , close it . i 'm gon na make some minutes or take some minutes . user interface : okay . marketing : yes . project manager : and uh it 's it 's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations . user interface : okay . project manager : you can all or we 're all uh marketing : project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white-board . project manager : yeah . yeah , but we 're all familiar with uh uh microsoft powerpoint , are we ? marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , okay . user interface : yeah . project manager : i 'm gon na wri uh write some stuff down marketing : alright . project manager : and then we 're ready . marketing : okay . project manager : or we can leave already i guess . marketing : yeah . project manager : or uh or sh or should we uh or is important that we leave at exact uh okay . marketing : no . i do n't think so . project manager : user interface : i do n't think oh marketing : great . project manager : we 'll see each other in uh thirty minutes . marketing : yeah . good luck . project manager : yeah , good luck . industrial designer : user interface : i will need it . marketing : i will need it ."
