    "answer": "phd c : yeah . we can yeah . sure . but we have to decide i mean we have to fix the system on this d on this data , to choose the best professor b : yeah . i right . phd c : and these professor b : but the question is when when do we fix the system , phd c : but we could professor b : do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on tuesday ? i yeah , ok except that we do have to write it up . phd c : i think we fixed on tuesday , yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : also , so phd c : yeah . yeah . uh yeah well . well basically it 's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some some other @ @ . professor b : right so maybe what we do is we we we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth phd c : yeah but mm - hmm . professor b : but we start the write - up right away because as you say there there 's only minor differences between these . phd c : i think you we could we could start soon , yeah . professor b : yeah . phd c : write up something . professor b : yeah , and and i i would you know , i would i 'd kind of like to see it phd c : um yeah . mm - hmm . professor b : maybe i can i can edit it a bit uh sure . the my what in this si i in this situation is my forte which is english . phd c : yeah . professor b : uh h yeah . have y have you seen alt d do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ? phd c : uh not really . um there is the format of the table which is quite impressive . professor b : yeah ? uh i see . yes , for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it 's not really that impressive , it 's just tiny . it 's all these little categories set a , set b , set c , multi - condition , clean . uh no mitigation . wow . do you know what no what no mitigation means here ? phd c : um it should be the the problem with the error channel error professor b : oh that 's probably the this is probably channel error stuff phd c : well , you professor b : huh ? oh this is i right , it says right above here channel channel error resilience , phd c : yeah . yeah . professor b : yeah . so recognition performance is just the top part , actually . uh and they have yes , split between seen databases and non - seen so basically between development and and evaluation . phd c : yeah . professor b : and so right , it 's presumed there 's all sorts of tuning that 's gone on on the see what they call seen databases and there wo n't be tuning for the uh unseen . multi - condition multi - condition . so they have looks like they have uh uh phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : so they splitting up between the ti - digits and everything else , i see . so the everything else is the speechdat - car , that 's the multi multilingual phd c : yeah , so it 's not divided between languages you mean or professor b : well , it is . phd c : it just professor b : it is , but there 's also there 's these tables over here for the for the ti - digits and these tables over here for the car data which is which is i guess all the multilingual stuff phd c : oh yeah . professor b : and then uh there 's they also split up between multi - condition and clean only . phd c : yeah . for ti - digits . yeah , actually yeah . for the ti - digits they want to train on clean and on noisy professor b : yeah . phd c : and yeah . professor b : so we 're doing that also , i guess . phd c : uh yeah . but uh we actually do we have the features ? yeah . for the clean ti - digits but we did not test it yet . uh the clean training stuff . professor b : well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh next few days phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : i guess they have to send it out let 's see the thirty - first is uh uh wednesday and i think the it has to be there by some hour uh european time on wednesday phd c : hmm - hmm . professor b : so i think basically phd d : we lost time uh wednesday maybe because that the difference in the time may be is a long different of the time . professor b : e excuse me ? phd d : maybe the thursday the twelfth of the night of the thurs - thirty - one is is not valid in europe . phd c : yeah . phd d : we do n't know is happening . professor b : yes , so i mean i think we have to actually get it done tuesday phd d : tuesday . professor b : right because i i think phd c : yeah , well . except if if it 's the thirty - one at midnight or i do n't know we can still do some work on wednesday morning . professor b : yeah well . w i is but is is it midni i thought it was actually something like five pm on phd c : yeah , well . yeah . phd d : yeah . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : was like i thought it was five pm or something , i did n't think it was midnight . i thought they said they wanted everything by phd d : yeah , five pm . professor b : well , so five pm their time is is if phd d : not five pm , three pm . professor b : three pm . phd d : three pm . professor b : alright , that 's six in the morning here . phd c : it 's d no . phd d : uh no three three a - three pm ? phd c : no , we are wondering about the the the hour that we have to eh i do n't know if it 's three pm it 's phd d : oh yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . three pm here is in europe midnight . phd c : yeah , it 's it 's midnight but professor b : yes , yes , but i did n't think it was midnight that it was due , i thought it was due at some hour during the day like five pm or something . phd d : oh ok . mm - hmm . mm - hmm , professor b : in which case phd d : maybe . professor b : so i i uh well we should look but my assumption is that we basically have to be done tuesday . um so then next thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath phd d : yeah . professor b : but then then we 'll actually have the new data which is the german and the danish phd c : yeah . professor b : but that really will be much less work because uh the system will be fixed phd c : yeah . professor b : so all we 'll do is take whatever they have and and uh and run it through the process . phd c : yeah . professor b : uh we wo n't be changing the training on anything phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : so there 'll be no new training , there 'll just be new htk runs , so that 's means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after after tuesday and and uh maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of uh the research . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : um you know what things uh did you think of when you were uh doing this process that uh you just did n't really have time to adequately work on uh uh so phd c : mm - hmm . yeah . professor b : what ? grad a : oh , stephane always has these great ideas and oh , but uh we do n't have time . phd c : sure . professor b : yeah . grad a : yeah . professor b : yeah . phd c : i 'm not sure these are great ideas . professor b : but they 're ideas . yeah ? oh , that was good . phd c : yeah . grad a : yeah . professor b : and and uh also it 's still true that uh i think it 's true that that we we at least got fairly consistent i improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features rather than uh in sequence which was was your suggestion and that that that seems to have been borne out . phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : the fact that none of these are are you know , enormous is is is not too surprising most improvements are n't enormous and uh phd c : yeah . professor b : some of them are but uh i mean you have something really really wrong and you fix it you can get big and really enormous improvements phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : but uh um cuz our best improvements over the years that we 've gotten from finding bugs , but anyway ok well i i think i see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about or or are we done ? phd c : mm - hmm . i think it 's ok um . we so basically we will i think we 'll try to to focus on these three architectures and and perhaps i was thinking also a fourth one with just just a single klt because we did not really test that professor b : uh - huh . phd c : removing all these klt 's and putting one single klt at the end . professor b : yeah , i mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it . phd c : yeah . professor b : uh if you can fit it in . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : oh i have yeah i do have one other piece of information which uh i should tell people outside of this group too uh i do n't know if we 're gon na need it uh but uh jeff up at the uh university of washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh ibm machines rs six thousands phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : and and uh so i think each one is four processors or something or i do n't know , eight hundred megahertz or something and there 's four processors in a box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some kind of ti so if you know he 's got a lot of processing power and um we 'd have to schedule it but if we have some big jobs and we wan na wan na wan na run them he 's he 's offering it . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : so . it 's uh when he was here eh uh he he used i not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as i could tell , so so in some ways he just got his payback , but uh again i i do n't know if we 'll end up with if we 're gon na be cpu limited on anything that we 're doing in this group phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : but but if if we are that 's an offer . ok well uh you guys doing great stuff so that 's that that 's really neat and uh we 'll uh uh g do n't think we need to uh um oh well the other thing i guess that i will say is that uh the digits that we 're gon na record momentarily is starting to get are starting to get into a pretty good size collection and um in addition to the speechdat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now so that 's that 's another source of data . um which is s under somewhat better control and that we can we can make measurements of the room the uh that you know if we feel there 's other measurements we do n't have that we 'd like to have we can make them and uh dave and i were just talking about that a little while ago so uh that 's another another possibility for this this kind of work . phd c : mm - hmm ."
