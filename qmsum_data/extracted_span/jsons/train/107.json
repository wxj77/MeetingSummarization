    "query": "<s> what did user interface think about the speech recognition command ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things . user interface : it seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it 's a great feature , but if you 're watching tv , there 's a lot of ambient sound , and it 's words . it 's not just , you know , noises like something hitting . it 's actual speech , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the tv speech , and the the user 's speech . otherwise , you can say remote . industrial designer : off . user interface : but if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies , because they 've triggered the remote control and it 's turned off your tv . so , i think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then yeah , it 'd be a really good marketing gimmick . but , i think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation . industrial designer : very good point . marketing : because tha w with speech recognition uh th i 'm not that good at that idea user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : but th if it 's a one-word recognition , 'cause i know with telephones and cars and things i 've seen in the states , user interface : yeah . marketing : a friend of mine says call mom , and it calls up mom ."
