    "answer": "project manager : okay . uh first of all i 'll start with the costs , marketing : . project manager : because that 's going to influence our design . user interface : oh no . marketing : oh , . project manager : if you do n't know if you al already had a look or not ? user interface : no n i i already did it . industrial designer : did you do your questionnaire already ? user interface : it 's not much . it 's just one question . project manager : because we have a problem . industrial designer : uh marketing : oh . project manager : if you look closely , you can see . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : it wants project manager : um i already took the liberty to make some suggestions . . . at the moment we have fifteen buttons , one lcd screen , one advanced chip-on-print . we use a uh sensor , that 's for the speech . uh we use kinetic energy . and we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour . okay . what 's the first thing we should drop ? the special colour of the buttons ? user interface : no that 's that 's for the trendy uh feel and look . so project manager : okay . uh industrial designer : yeah but everything is . project manager : should we switch to a hand dynamo ? user interface : project manager : uh that 's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . user interface : yeah , b but marketing : yeah but young people like that . project manager : batteries ? marketing : so just do normal battery . project manager : batteries . user interface : i think the battery option . industrial designer : just a normal battery then , yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : . marketing : it has to be twelve and a half . project manager : yeah . marketing : or not ? user interface : oh . project manager : so industrial designer : oh my goodness . project manager : you 're going to redesign something . marketing : user interface : oh no . project manager : okay , so we 're at twenty five . marketing : uh , yeah . project manager : um do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? industrial designer : well i guess i we 'll have to go for single curve then . i mean we have to drop on everything . project manager : mm-hmm . uh marketing : but we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it 's it 's flat , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and the screen screen is just well you just have to hold it like this then . so project manager : yeah . um industrial designer : how about sorry . project manager : uh another option i saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you ca n't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . that would skip nine buttons and four and a half euros . industrial designer : that 's what i was thinking . user interface : yeah . marketing : alright . project manager : yeah ? marketing : let 's do it then . yeah . project manager : uh then we have left user interface : but we do n't have any basic options any more . marketing : we project manager : uh yeah . we do . industrial designer : and uh 'cause then they do n't have to n they do n't need special colour as well . marketing : f_ eight . project manager : they do n't need special colours . fine . that 's more like it . marketing : yeah . user interface : project manager : you were saying something . industrial designer : that was exactly my point . like let 's drop all the buttons , and just make one project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i mean we 're gon na use the lcd screen anyway . so we 'll just have to use it for everything . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah . industrial designer : and then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click project manager : yeah , some more menu options . yeah . okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . industrial designer : project manager : but um now let 's look . user interface : yeah we c could we only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . everything you can do with with the menu . so with the display . industrial designer : project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah we need one integrated button for everything then . user interface : yeah . marketing : the joystick . project manager : uh industrial designer : yeah . kind of . i was because marketing : project manager : yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh industrial designer : yeah . if you if you go to marketing : integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah . industrial designer : if you go to our uh view , like you if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wan na adjust the treble for instance , project manager : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : this is just uh an example , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : y y you wan na see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example . project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : but you want a sound preview of how it 's gon na sound , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : right ? so you wan na click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so you 'll you 'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button . marketing : yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so that 's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you 're out of it . industrial designer : exactly . marketing : but you still but you then still need to have well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . but you still um industrial designer : yeah it 's r yeah . marketing : you still have to have some some button in the menu to go back . user interface : so you do one inte you can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . marketing : yeah . user interface : and then just drop all the other buttons . project manager : uh yeah . marketing : well not all . user interface : but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . marketing : not s not sound i guess . industrial designer : no . project manager : yeah . it 's uh one integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button . marketing : user interface : yeah . project manager : so user interface : so we have to to make it s uh more uh it has to be project manager : you could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . you just drop the okay and the back . marketing : yeah . wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ? project manager : oh , that 's for the speech . marketing : speech recognition . project manager : yeah . user interface : could drop the speech recognition . marketing : right . project manager : s s drop speech recognition ? industrial designer : no but project manager : yeah that 's possible . user interface : we we d industrial designer : yeah it 's it 's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 'cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons . project manager : buttons . marketing : buttons . project manager : that 's not very easy to use . user interface : yeah . marketing : no , it can be disturbed by by noise and project manager : industrial designer : yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works . marketing : stuff like that . let let let me see what 's more what 's more popular . i guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . user interface : yeah . marketing : i have to look on that . let me see . uh well no i was wrong . project manager : marketing : there are more people who like speech recognition than an lcd screen . project manager : yep . okay . because if you d lose the lcd screen , we need a lot of marketing : but if it but it it it 's a it 's a both a hypers user interface : we lose our whole concept . project manager : yeah . user interface : uh so no we just project manager : we need a lot of extra buttons . marketing : no , but user interface : we keep the lcd . marketing : well we yeah we keep the screen . i mean it 's it 's about the same . eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six . industrial designer : we uh we we have n't really integrated this the speech into the system , project manager : so we drop the speech . industrial designer : so we can might as well s drop that . project manager : and drop it yeah ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . let 's drop the speech . project manager : okay . s fo four less euros . so we still have three and a half euro to lose . user interface : marketing : sixteen euros . industrial designer : we need to lose some buttons . marketing : but y y project manager : yeah if you lose the the back , the okay button uh v let 's say we only have the four arrows , and the menu button . marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : then you 're marketing : and then and then use um project manager : oh and the power button we have also . marketing : the the okay . and the menu button does also does the okay function then . project manager : yeah . marketing : and then when you in the menu project manager : so that 's one euro . marketing : s so so you activate the menu . user interface : if we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons . project manager : yeah . yeah ? and user interface : with with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . with the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera . marketing : yeah yeah . yeah . . project manager : that would save zero point two euros compared to no . user interface : no it 's three euros . no ? um project manager : yeah . to this together is more expensive than oof , it 's almost the same as t keeping this . user interface : no it 's it 's n yeah . yeah yeah yeah . project manager : and we can drop these two . marketing : well okay . user interface : it 's the marketing : for example if you have f f four buttons , channel up and down , uh volume left right project manager : volume . marketing : okay , i 've i think we have to keep that . project manager : and the power button . marketing : and then and the power button . so that 's five . project manager : that 's the basic . marketing : that 's basic . that that 's what you need anyway . and then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu . or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . and then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . click again , it 's okay . then you only need one button to move back . or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . and in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . user interface : marketing : so that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . project manager : yep . okay th that 's marketing : but we ca n't drop three buttons . industrial designer : which that 's even marketing : but i see that 's project manager : yeah that 's one euro more expensive . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : so that 's not a good idea . project manager : that 's not an option . marketing : because which buttons do we have now ? those five which i mentioned , and then menu , and then project manager : menu , power . marketing : yeah . f of the four things ? project manager : four arrows ? marketing : yeah , th power . project manager : power . uh industrial designer : yeah , if you if you go to eight marketing : which more ? industrial designer : i do n't know how to project manager : yeah . okay . so four arrows ? marketing : yeah . project manager : uh power i believe ? marketing : power . th yeah that 's five . project manager : uh we have a back and a okay button . marketing : yeah , okay that 's seven , project manager : and the menu . marketing : and one to activate the menu , yeah . so okay that 's eight . well we ca n't reduce that . we we keep the display . project manager : yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . so marketing : oh , well okay . yeah . project manager : industrial designer : yeah , we need the chip for the for the l_c_ display . marketing : project manager : the lcd ? yeah . user interface : let 's make the let 's make the case plastic . marketing : yeah well we need the advanced project manager : then i rather make it wood . marketing : instead of r project manager : because then also it 's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . true . marketing : yeah but but that 's not our market . user interface : but project manager : no that maybe not . but maybe it 's better than plastic anyway . marketing : ah no , hard plastic . user interface : plastic with a with a special colour . industrial designer : oh . user interface : a woo wood uh wood uh wood colour . marketing : yeah , plastic with special colour . project manager : yeah ? marketing : no but i i project manager : yeah okay uh user interface : that 's an option . marketing : because we have to use the special colour anyway . you forgot that . user interface : yeah . project manager : yep . yeah , yeah . user interface : so we do one one s marketing : so let 's go for the plastic . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , okay . plastic . marketing : and since it 's not kinetic , it does n't have to flip around that much ? project manager : uh that 's easy because plastic is free . marketing : we still have problem of two euros . project manager : yeah , okay . uh if we dropped uh marketing : user interface : no the buttons , those are really needed . project manager : yeah ? user interface : yeah th th it 's it 's uh marketing : yeah we ca n't drop them . user interface : an advanced chip-on-print . project manager : you still need that . industrial designer : yeah uh marketing : do we really need that advanced chip for an lcd display ? industrial designer : you uh uh yeah . so the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and which can use a regular chip , wh which is six euros in total . project manager : s industrial designer : that does n't matter . marketing : oh . i rather keep i rather keep the display . project manager : no , i keep the re yeah . yeah . because we already designed for it . so industrial designer : well yeah . marketing : so the only option is an hand dynamo . industrial designer : exactly . user interface : oh that project manager : yeah and something else . industrial designer : yeah but the marketing : oh no tha oh that 's one euro , right . industrial designer : uh ca n't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'cause that will save us one and a half euro already . and then if w marketing : and then integrated s yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . project manager : no y you would rec marketing : i mean it 's not that important , easy to use , but project manager : then you have industrial designer : th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? project manager : then you still need two additional buttons i believe . industrial designer : and uh marketing : yeah . project manager : for the volume . industrial designer : yeah d at l yeah . at least one for power . project manager : you can use those yeah . user interface : but the project manager : oh yeah and power . that 's three buttons and this would cost industrial designer : oh . yeah it 's just as expensive as what we have now . user interface : but the integrated uh button ? how many func functions can it uh have ? project manager : yeah . three . up , down , okay . industrial designer : yeah endlessly . i mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . user interface : okay . industrial designer : you can go into you in you main menu , marketing : you you press it for like three seconds . industrial designer : you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options . marketing : then then then you should do everything in the menu . on the screen . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah , okay . it would save enough industrial designer : maybe we should . 'cause we do n't have money and w we want the screen . project manager : yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half euro left . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we can maybe still use power button . marketing : yeah , but we 'd alright . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i guess we have to . marketing : it s it saves us four euros and it costs us two and a half . so let 's see , we we drop the price by one and a half . project manager : yeah . you see ? industrial designer : we 'll we 'll be on marketing : but we still have thirteen left . project manager : oh still yeah ? oh then i miscalculated . oh yeah . marketing : thirteen . so still half . project manager : shit . drop the special colour . marketing : there goes the special co user interface : oh no . marketing : well that would make it less appealing . so that 's no option . project manager : 'kay . what else ? uncurved ? user interface : no no , it has to be um curved . marketing : we sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah it says right here . project manager : they made it very easy for us . user interface : okay . marketing : well yeah . yeah . we made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it 's a cool feature . project manager : ah , i do n't think i can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than marketing : user interface : okay . wh what we could do is um drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : buttons . that 's oh yeah since we only have one button . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : yeah but i mean what is meant by special colour ? project manager : i just m i do n't i think user interface : just something else than than black or white i think . project manager : uh yeah it 's i think it 's grey , regular . marketing : s yeah . alright . project manager : grey and rubber . industrial designer : but we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . project manager : of plastic . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : damn . marketing : so i rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : yeah and then project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah yeah . marketing : you can still play with it then i guess . i do n't know . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . so i guess that is n't an option . user interface : the display industrial designer : well , you only have to power it up when you wan na use it . marketing : yeah . user interface : the but if you have to power the for ten minutes , then the marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i do n't know . marketing : yeah . project manager : no i do n't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no . industrial designer : . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah true . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : let 's let 's go for the hand dynamo then . project manager : yeah hand dynamo ? do you want an extra button ? marketing : or or do we or do we do uncurved and flat ? instead of project manager : user interface : no no it has to be curved . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . user interface : yeah . just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and a screen . industrial designer : yeah . that 's the most import project manager : yep ? instead of an additional power button ? user interface : yeah or spe special form ? marketing : yeah . s what what is special f oh yeah , special form . project manager : yeah ? marketing : maybe that 's nicer . project manager : it 's for scroll user interface : yeah . project manager : without marketing : but we do n't have any buttons . industrial designer : we only have marketing : so do user interface : yeah . but it 's it 's for the integrated button , i think also . or marketing : d uh make it a special colour then . industrial designer : yeah but marketing : yeah ma make it a special colour then . project manager : yeah but it 's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . so user interface : yeah . okay . yeah . marketing : okay . make it a special colour and then it look fancy . project manager : yeah ? so woah we 're within budget . marketing : so yeah . project manager : it 's a miracle . user interface : oh just marketing : let 's let 's save it . user interface : oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . marketing : yeah . user interface : okay . marketing : let 's do it like this , i mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we project manager : yeah ? okay . um , well . 'kay , this was old . industrial designer : well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ? user interface : yeah . okay . marketing : yeah all your designs are uh pretty much project manager : yeah back to work . uh industrial designer : project manager : did i save it ? industrial designer : it 's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah but that but that 's the fun part of it . project manager : i i wanted to go , but i was n't allowed . so industrial designer : oh yeah ? okay . marketing : alright . project manager : uh i just forgot to save this . just a minute . . marketing : yeah what 's the next uh phase ? project manager : yeah , this the last phase of course , so marketing : uh the agenda . by your humble p_m_ . project manager : hmm . oh . marketing : oh f frustrated . alright . project manager : okay . um marketing : yeah . project manager : well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . but well as you saw that had n't made no sense , because we had to drop it . industrial designer : drop everything . yeah . marketing : drop , yeah . project manager : uh industrial designer : we went straight into finance ? project manager : yeah . user interface : marketing : project manager : yeah it was more important , so i just marketing : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : for yeah . project manager : pushed up the agenda . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh , evaluation criteria . you have t produced something about that ? marketing : yeah that that 's yeah . i uh i sure did . and it combines with product evaluation . uh so project manager : uh you put it in the . marketing : we all have to keep in mind what has changed now . so what we have left on the because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . project manager : yeah . marketing : alright . project manager : f_ five . marketing : let 's make it big . um well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . true or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a scale , as we all know it . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : user interface : marketing : um well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . um well they are in a word document , which i will open now . project manager : alt up marketing : yeah . i do n't know it 's open yet . no . and we all have to uh agree on a certain level . what 's this ? project manager : freaky . marketing : oh . i do n't know . um well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . so that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . how do you think about that ? industrial designer : i think it does . because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of lcd , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : right ? project manager : uh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh marketing : yeah the us u it it industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it 's it 's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so do you think industrial designer : well , we have extended menus , on the on the lcd screen . so marketing : yeah . you can you can ma yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . that 's true . i mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen . industrial designer : i no . marketing : so on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ? user interface : two or three . two or three . marketing : huh ? two or three ? something like that ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : well we have to choose one . so uh what do you say ? project manager : uh y we should fill this in now . marketing : i agree on two . project manager : yeah okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : uh marketing : i uh i say two , personally . but project manager : yeah in the new design i s would say it 's three . but now , in original design i say two . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah alright . marketing : yeah well we have to evaluate i guess what we have now . project manager : okay then i say three . marketing : yeah ? you say three , industrial designer : yeah yeah . marketing : and you you said al also three ? user interface : yeah . marketing : three ? okay well i say still two , but it has to be three then . project manager : hey , you 're marketing , eh . user interface : marketing : yeah i know . so it 's made bold . but it 's nah , it 's not very clear on the sc project manager : hmm . m maybe underline . user interface : or give it a colour . marketing : maybe other colour , yeah . that 's better . project manager : red . marketing : uh yeah . alright . oh , it does n't have to be bold anymore . project manager : oh yeah very true . user interface : marketing : alright . yeah . user interface : yeah true one . marketing : um well the remote control has wha project manager : he types everything . industrial designer : definitely one . it has to be . user interface : yeah . marketing : the remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . for example audio settings and screen settings . user interface : it hides uh basic functions . project manager : everything . you do n't use anything else . marketing : yeah . well , yeah . so it it 's a very true point . i mean it hides all those function . industrial designer : you 're not gon na find them . project manager : yeah . yeah okay . yeah . user interface : yeah true . marketing : but , i mean uh they 're hidden in the screen . if you do n't want to use them , you do n't s you s just scroll over them . and you place them project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : f i do n't know where . so that 's very true , i guess , for our case . industrial designer : yeah the next not so much so . marketing : uh the second point . it shows the relevant and most used functions . project manager : nope . marketing : power button . do we ha still have a power button ? project manager : uh check with the excel sheet . marketing : well yeah the button 's integrated , huh ? user interface : i think we are industrial designer : yeah . yeah it 's uh it 's integrated . marketing : yeah we dropped it . you j you just push it in for user interface : it 's in oh yeah it was integrateds . yeah . project manager : yeah integrate it . marketing : yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then project manager : yeah . industrial designer : e exactly just like a m mobile . marketing : yeah . i do n't know . project manager : just go scrolling and it will activate . user interface : marketing : yeah . um it shows the relevant and most used functions . industrial designer : . marketing : yeah uh on the other uh on one side i would say yes , and the other side i would say no . so it 's i do n't know . project manager : it shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but user interface : can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? marketing : yeah . user interface : no , you have to scroll through the menu , before marketing : with the scroll butt yeah and then say channel . and then user interface : yeah . so it 's it 's not industrial designer : well uh we should b build it so that if you do n't kind of push into the menu or something , if when it 's on , yeah , it 's turned on , project manager : you say you double click on the industrial designer : it automatically has the the programme and the volume function , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some of you marketing : yeah . industrial designer : or you double click it . marketing : but but how do you change from volume to channel ? project manager : industrial designer : no because it has four arrows , right ? project manager : no , not anymore . user interface : no . marketing : no . project manager : because he 's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in . industrial designer : oh yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : like on the the mouse . industrial designer : yeah i was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick . marketing : no we have n we have no buttons left . so the joystick was not an option . industrial designer : yeah that is a bummer . marketing : so so you hav project manager : yeah . marketing : so you you have to double-click , i mean , for , i mean , uh volume , project manager : to get into menu . yeah . marketing : and three double click for the menu , or something . user interface : oh no . project manager : or hold it ten seconds . industrial designer : we 'll make it a morse code . marketing : yeah . yeah . yeah . alright . user interface : marketing : but but ease of use was not very important , may i remind you . project manager : no no no . uh it should be trendy . marketing : so that 's user interface : industrial designer : marketing : yeah but that that 's not a question . industrial designer : marketing : uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . user interface : marketing : well i think it 's pretty much in the middle . project manager : yeah . four . marketing : you have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . so project manager : yeah , im in the menu . user interface : seven . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so maybe it 's more like a f a five . or user interface : yeah . five . industrial designer : yeah i would go for five or six , yeah . marketing : yeah . five or six ? project manager : five . user interface : five . yep . industrial designer : okay five . marketing : five ? alright . industrial designer : let 's not diss our remote . user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's the weirdest remote control i 've ever seen . so marketing : oh . yeah . industrial designer : yep . just one button . project manager : well it 's different . marketing : yeah . alright . uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like lcd screen and speech recognition . industrial designer : but uh yep . project manager : yeah . marketing : well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . but it has at least one innovation . project manager : yeah , it 's still yeah , i say two . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we still have the fruit and vegetable print . marketing : i say two then . project manager : oh , that 's the next . marketing : yeah but that that 's not that 's not this question . uh thi uh that 's the other question . industrial designer : fr oh i mean the oh never mind . i 'm a bit lost . project manager : marketing : this one . user interface : i think a two . no . marketing : two yeah . industrial designer : . marketing : i think lcd 's more useful than speech project manager : yeah definitely . marketing : what ? oh not the bold one . industrial designer : it 's way more practical , yeah . marketing : right . okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it should have been two questions . i realise now , because sponge-like material is dropped . project manager : marketing : but the look and feel project manager : you still have rubber d or no . industrial designer : yeah . so we still uh we still have the primary colours . but only on the on the outside , not on the button . user interface : no you got a plastic . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : the button has also colour . yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah ? project manager : the one button we have . industrial designer : okay . marketing : yeah . the one . industrial designer : yeah . yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . project manager : yeah you could check with the excel sheet . marketing : mm mm . user interface : yeah . you only have one yeah . marketing : yeah we have single curve now , industrial designer : and and colour . marketing : and no and no material industrial designer : yeah . s marketing : . so maybe in the middle or something . project manager : yeah . user interface : four . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , i mean it 's project manager : yeah or three . industrial designer : uh marketing : worth the yeah . project manager : we have something . industrial designer : actually we d we did n't do so well on this one . because it 's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . still , it 's still hard . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i mean the sponge-like and the three d_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . project manager : new . yeah . marketing : yeah . but then we would have to drop the screen . user interface : red . marketing : oh red . yeah . project manager : you like both . marketing : yeah . i like bold . project manager : marketing : uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . project manager : um oh yeah . user interface : mm yeah yeah . industrial designer : of course . project manager : i just could n't marketing : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : you just have to draw it . project manager : um , just one minute . user interface : it 's the white part uh industrial designer : yeah but it be because uh we could n't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the project manager : . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : so user interface : we have a we have a industrial designer : so i mean i wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . but marketing : but there 's uh enough space for the corporate logo . i mean , if there 's only one thing . industrial designer : hell yeah . if we have only one button . marketing : yeah . so i will say that is very true . project manager : . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an r_ and the reversed r_ , user interface : industrial designer : does n't it ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so marketing : the remote control is easy to use . well i would say skill , uh i would say six , or something . i do n't think it 's easy to use , or not so . industrial designer : the only e the only thing easy about it is that you do n't have to move your fingers . 'cause it has only one button . marketing : yeah . user interface : and that you only have to control one button . industrial designer : yeah exactly . marketing : yeah . it it it has a nice screen . but yeah . user interface : it gives visual feedback . so marketing : yeah . well i i would say a five or a six . user interface : i think a five . five . industrial designer : i would say six . marketing : what do you say ? easy to use ? five or a six ? industrial designer : it 's really not easy to use . user interface : project manager : no not anymore . user interface : industrial designer : 'cause you 're putting everything marketing : so a six , more . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , uh i would go for the six too . so user interface : okay . yeah . industrial designer : most votes count . um project manager : marketing : user interface : marketing : um well , another question , user interface : yeah that looks uh great . marketing : uh the remote control is durable . user interface : marketing : i do n't know if that 's the correct word . user interface : yeah . nah industrial designer : definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic marketing : but uh in use , both battery as casing ? industrial designer : yeah . yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . marketing : yeah ? true , true . industrial designer : and the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever . marketing : and the casing is plastic , ? yeah . if you do n't drop it too much , it 's uh should last pretty long . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so i would go for one . marketing : yeah ? but uh i think rubber compared is better . so i think a two is more appropriate user interface : yeah . s project manager : industrial designer : okay yeah . marketing : than user interface : wow . marketing : yeah . logo . project manager : yeah . user interface : marketing : okay i will go go for two . uh the last one ? the remote control 's a good example for company 's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . industrial designer : oh . no m user interface : no we put the electronics into the fashion . project manager : yeah well yeah . industrial designer : i would g marketing : uh turn around . yeah . but um industrial designer : i would go for four . project manager : no marketing : yeah ? industrial designer : because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . marketing : it 's not yeah , true . project manager : yeah okay . marketing : so a four . it 's it g it g goes , it 's not the best we could do , i guess . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but it all has to do with the budget , because it 's it 's not the bad idea we had , so industrial designer : yeah . yeah yeah . user interface : yeah , four is okay . marketing : alright , yeah . right . project manager : so industrial designer : that 's it . marketing : so if i understood it right , we have to count these numbers . project manager : ooh . and yeah ? what ? marketing : uh yeah . mm-hmm . oh project manager : yeah . marketing : oh alright . word document , the project manager : yeah . that marketing : yeah we have to count them . project manager : count them . add them ?

and then you can count them together . marketing : yeah . i think you can just count them by a user interface : just count it to yeah . marketing : um let 's move over . project manager : okay . three , four , nine . marketing : three , plus one , four . nine . project manager : uh marketing : uh , yeah . are you here ? industrial designer : eleven . marketing : eleven . project manager : eleven , industrial designer : fifteen . marketing : fifteen . project manager : fifteen . user interface : sixteen . industrial designer : sixteen . marketing : sixteen , yeah . industrial designer : seventeen . project manager : seventeen . marketing : no sixteen . uh sixteen plus six . industrial designer : oh what ?

project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . twenty eight industrial designer : yeah but project manager : divided by nine . marketing : di divided by nine project manager : so thr t two . marketing : makes three point one one one one one one one . project manager : so we 're better than average . industrial designer : but marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ? project manager : no . industrial designer : i do n't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . marketing : user interface : some questions are yeah . industrial designer : so if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low the lower the better . but if you give true to a negative question marketing : yeah , but there are no negative questions i guess . good example . durable use . industrial designer : durable , that 's good . marketing : easy to use . this is good . industrial designer : easy to use . marketing : fancy look and feel , that 's good . industrial designer : yeah . . marketing : technology innovation was good , because of a marketing uh requirement . industrial designer : also good . yeah okay . marketing : re relevant most used function . industrial designer : i guess you did do it . marketing : and hides these functions . that was also a good thing . user interface : oh yeah . yeah . industrial designer : oh yeah yeah . no marketing : and then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . okay . marketing : so it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . so industrial designer : yeah true . marketing : yes , so the it tells us something , yes . becau but the picture would be a lot different if we did n't have to drop those uh those things , i guess . user interface : oh great . project manager : things , yeah . industrial designer : yeah definitely definitely . project manager : okay . industrial designer : because now it 's just an average it 's remote . marketing : yeah . nah it it 's it 's better than average , but industrial designer : yeah okay because of the lcd screen . but uh it looks and stuff , it still uh marketing : yeah . so th project manager : it 's still yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : has some shortcomings . industrial designer : it 's not , it 's not really eye-catching , except for the colour . project manager : marketing : the colour and the screen . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay so um this we had , this we had . we have to do a product evaluation . industrial designer : product evaluation . project manager : uh prototype presentation we dropped . so uh the finance we looked . we have redesigned . uh not on that , but marketing : yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this project manager : so you can just make one big lcd screen . user interface : okay it 's your turn now . industrial designer : shall we try ? marketing : with some casing around it , yeah . industrial designer : black . okay uh we 're still gon na go for the fancy colours ? project manager : yeah uh user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but are we gon na stick with the green or are we gon na do blue ? marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah we we can just uh use this one . and then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh project manager : the the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour . marketing : yeah . user interface : he only needs one button . industrial designer : one scroll button and project manager : it 's plastic . and single curved . user interface : yeah . or we have to delete this one or marketing : yeah . project manager : oh and you might want to add a uh infrared led . user interface : oh oh no . marketing : oh yeah . project manager : otherwise it uh does n't function uh so well . industrial designer : for what ? user interface : okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : user interface : so that 's marketing : do we have to do other things ? project manager : well i have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . marketing : or just redesign ? alright . project manager : and i try to get chip just before uh i uh receive the excel sheet . marketing : yeah . project manager : so i marketing : so you made a start , right ? project manager : yeah i 'm i 'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me . industrial designer : should give it some time ? marketing : yeah . project manager : uh user interface : okay , but how do we make the the scroll uh button ? project manager : i was here . so user interface : it 's just one industrial designer : have to take this away also . marketing : alright . user interface : yeah . project manager : ah industrial designer : and this um user interface : uh that 's the infrared uh thing . industrial designer : oh yeah , of course . marketing : the the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um pen yeah ? format . current colour red . marketing : the playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour industrial designer : oh yeah we did our special colour for the user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : line widths , now that 's a ten . marketing : that 's conceptual , yes . project manager : that 's enough to get started with , so user interface : yeah . um , uh it 's just a scroll industrial designer : it 's gon na be one str scroll . user interface : yeah , is it 's horizontal or vertical ? marketing : how many pages ? project manager : uh , i just took one for every step and then a conclusion . user interface : i think marketing : alright . y you have you have done the first two . industrial designer : horizontal 's easier too , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : 'cause you can marketing : okay , and and the look and feel is user interface : yeah . industrial designer : is it more natural than this ? project manager : well i think i have to make a p an issue called finance . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : so let 's say whoops . 'kay . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : basically . user interface : it does n't look like uh marketing : the items we had to drop . project manager : yeah . user interface : uh it it 's it 's not yeah . it 's not very fashionable anymore . but uh it 's okay . industrial designer : it 's really ugly . user interface : yeah . marketing : where did we start with price ? user interface : maybe m make it bigger ? or marketing : twenty six and a half . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : or not ? or twenty six ? something like that . user interface : yeah . that looks little bit more uh maybe that 's a s a special colour for it . so we can make it uh special ? industrial designer : oh marketing : this ? industrial designer : what do you mean ? like a other colour than this one ? user interface : or or speckles in it ? i dunno . uh marketing : speckles ? user interface : industrial designer : yeah can we do it uh uh can we do a print ? user interface : .. $ i 'm not sure . project manager : ... . i do n't think so , if you see the options . but industrial designer : i think we have to choose , yeah ? marketing : uh industrial designer : okay special colour . we do have special colour . user interface : yeah red is already a special colour , i think . so industrial designer : does it mean uh that user interface : it 's not very special , but uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ? user interface : yeah . just uh put the purple uh purple on it . industrial designer : purdy . marketing : yeah . some some big dots . industrial designer : purple ? user interface : that 's trendy . industrial designer : yeah yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : oh no my remote has acne . marketing : ... . we have the original balance sheet , or project manager : yeah . user interface : marketing : yeah . user interface : woah . industrial designer : no . that 's why we have that button . project manager : user interface : oh yeah . industrial designer : it 's so cute . user interface : hmm . oh what ?

project manager : then i have to uh uh write this , marketing : we have to present project manager : and i do n't know if you have to present , because i did n't receive any information about that so far . marketing : alright . industrial designer : maybe we will . project manager : maybe we get a a final mail . marketing : so it after the after after these five minutes , you have to project manager : yeah . yeah , i have still ten minutes to finish the report . industrial designer : what 's this anyway ? user interface : so cake . marketing : alright . after after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or industrial designer : it looks like candle wax . project manager : yeah . marketing : alright . and we uh project manager : and you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or marketing : right . chill . project manager : oh no , they do n't have beer here so you ca n't celebrate . you can just if you ma finish my presentation please . uh over there . marketing : uh yeah ? project manager : the presentation is still open . so if you finish that then you 'll see uh yeah next . marketing : next slide . project manager : oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . just uh do that quickly . marketing : yeah ? project manager : uh marketing : how do you do it ? project manager : uh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um marketing : alright . project manager : so how were did the project process uh go ? did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? or are there uh industrial designer : uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? or project manager : yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth . industrial designer : yeah well at first i was really stressed . because it went a bit fast . project manager : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but then as i knew the tempo that i had to be on , the second time i think i did a bit better . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and the third time yeah , i mean marketing : and we move more to to working together as team , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . project manager : . industrial designer : yeah , yeah yeah yeah . marketing : and then finally you have some idea , okay this is gon na w this is what we gon na make together and okay i will arrange this and you will arrange that , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah we marketing : the process , i mean , the interaction between us became better and better i guess . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . especially after the first meeting . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : and marketing : yeah , especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting i guess . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . definitely . project manager : okay and was that due to my leadership ? user interface : yeah yeah yeah . marketing : industrial designer : well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that project manager : yeah ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . you were more in charge kind of thing . project manager : that okay ? marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . um was there uh enough room for creativity ? industrial designer : i guess so . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah but only the the financial parts uh industrial designer : i mean marketing : li limiteded afterwards , user interface : yeah . marketing : but if if you do n't take that into account , there 's plenty of room for creativ creativity . also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh industrial designer : we were pretty democratic . marketing : the the board and uh powerpoint and word and stuff like that . project manager : so and the uh about the board digital pen ? uh was that helpful or industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm uh i think in in essence project manager : marketing : the digital pen is better than the smartboard . because it it it just works better . project manager : yeah it works . marketing : i mean uh uh i 've made yeah , uh i 've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . user interface : yeah . marketing : so it it 's better a better device than uh project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : maybe yeah . marketing : than the screen . but the screen is useful , in essence , but it does n't work that well . industrial designer : it 's uh it 's the the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we 're all used to writing with pen . project manager : use the pen . industrial designer : and uh as i said , uh i uh have no idea how powerpoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but once i get to know the program probably , i mean , it looks better , you know . or uh something like that . you can give it a kind of a home style , like we have i the the logo and everything . project manager : yeah yeah . industrial designer : and i do n't know . project manager : blink . oh . marketing : warning . finish meeting now . user interface : finish meeting . project manager : okay , are are there any new ideas about this ? all i think marketing : well , it project manager : i did n't really receive , yeah . marketing : it 's use especially useful , i guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . project manager : uh uh w uh marketing : and and project manager : s sorry uh marketing : the screen and stuff like that . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : i think the powerpoint is is too limited . you ca n't uh draw easy in in powerpoint . it has to be uh yeah . the drawing board has to be integrated into powerpoint , so that you can just easily marketing : yeah . user interface : industrial designer : yeah the the the problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever . marketing : yeah . yeah . but it it 's useful to to show something to to an a small audience , and then to user interface : yeah just for text , for text it 's uh it 's okay . but marketing : yeah . these these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things . so project manager : oh . user interface : marketing : yes . check your email . project manager : uh we should uh enter our questionnaire . marketing : you also . user interface : 'kay . project manager : ah . woah . industrial designer : alright . marketing : right . project manager : okay . uh okay . user interface : okay . industrial designer : alright . marketing : yes boss . industrial designer : well , s see you in a second huh ? . project manager : that 's the management . marketing : well see you soon . project manager : hope so . user interface : okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : um"
