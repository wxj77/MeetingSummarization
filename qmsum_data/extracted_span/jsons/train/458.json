    "answer": "mark reckless am : yes . can i follow up on tracking adopted children ? i entirely understand that you ca n't force parents to disclose that their child is adopted . however , my understanding was that , in england , there was a dataset with social services that was shared with schools in a way that i 'm not clear is happening in wales and how , if at all , that links to the pupil level annual school census data . perhaps sort of linked to that , is n't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools , potentially , with adopted children more aware that adopted children who were previously looked after have this potential grant , and would they not be more willing to disclose this , at least confidentially to the school and government , if they knew there was this upside of doing so ?"
