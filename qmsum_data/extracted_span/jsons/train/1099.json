    "query": "<s> what did bergeron think of the cooperation between two levels of government when discussing the inquiries towards service canada and their cooperation with quebec ?",
    "answer": "the chair : we will now continue with mr.bergeron . mr. stphane bergeron : mr.chair , as the leader of the bloc qubcois mentioned a few moments ago , the government promised $ 14billion to quebec and the provinces , but in targeted transfers . that is very little compared to the considerable expenses incurred to deal with the current crisis . but quebec and the provinces do n't just want this money to be transferred unconditionally , they also want a real discussion on a permanent increase in health care transfers . premierlegault was rightly concerned about the feds ' interference into provincial jurisdictions . the federal government , which does not manage any hospitals or long-term care centres , must stop playing armchair quarterback and transfer the money to the only governments with jurisdiction over health , that is , quebec and the provinces . will it do so without delay and without nitpicking ? the honourable patty hajdu ( minister of health ) : mr.chair , we know that the government of quebec is working hard to ensure the safety of quebeckers and we are here to support them . as part of this co-operation , we have developed health and safety recommendations for workplaces , we have purchased medical equipment for workers and we have supported the province in developing its reopening program . we are continuing this important partnership to ensure the safety of quebeckers and all canadians . mr. stphane bergeron : the co-operation is so effective that the money is staying in the federal government 's coffers . in fact , when the federal government wants to impose conditions , it always takes longer . we see it with housing , for which quebec has not received a dime of the $ 1.4billion it is owed . we have also seen it with infrastructure funds , particularly for public transit , water systems and water treatment . the health crisis is now . the needs are now . the much needed reopening of our economy is now . will the government finally transfer the money without messing around or quibbling ? hon . pablo rodriguez : i am pleased to confirm to my colleague that there is no messing around , no quibbling , nothing of the kind . there is co-operation between two levels of government . it is natural to have discussions with all the provinces and with quebec . i myself am taking part in some discussions and several of my colleagues are taking part in others . there is a clear willingness on the part of the federal government to co-operate with quebec and all the provinces . that is what we are doing and that is perhaps what the bloc qubcois does not like . it likes bickering , but for the time being , there is none . mr. stphane bergeron : we do n't want to bicker , we want the money to be paid out . it is not complicated , for heaven 's sake ! we do not want a blank cheque . right now , the money remains in the federal government 's coffers . there is $ 1.4billion that should be paid to quebec for social housing and is sitting in the federal government 's coffers . we are waiting for money for water treatment and water systems , but it is sitting in the federal government 's coffers . it 's almost july . we are wasting precious months for construction . what is the government waiting for to pay out the money so that we can get our economy rolling ? hon . pablo rodriguez : the federal government is a very active partner . we are discussing and working with quebec on infrastructure projects . we are continuing our discussions and negotiations on the housing agreement . nothing is at a standstill . we are discussing and co-operating for the well-being of all quebeckers . mr. stphane bergeron : madamchair , things are definitely at a standstill , because the money is owed and has not been paid out . months are going by while construction is not taking place . we need to reopen the economy . we need more flexibility in the gas tax program and quebec 's contribution to allow municipalities to undertake work on city halls , community centres and fire stations . we need the federal government to contribute to funding public transit operations , which have become a real financial drain because of the drop in ridership . what is the federal government waiting for to provide real help instead of just talking ?"
