    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about user interface 's presentation on buttons , the layout design , and the color of the remote control ?",
    "answer": "project manager : okay , gabriel . let 's um let 's let 's hear from you about the um it 's the interface . user interface : alright . alright . yeah , some of what i have to say ties into what catherine was just talking about . project manager : great . industrial designer : sorry . user interface : okay , so i 'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . and so basically i consulted with our manufacturing division . it sounded like catherine was also speaking with them . uh i also took uh reissa 's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause i think that 's that 's crucial as far as uh what keys we 're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they 're laid out . uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . so i already mentioned the speech recognition interface . marketing : user interface : i guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . it 's it 's pointless . uh it 's just a sample sensor sample output . it would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the tv . uh so yeah , they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m_p_ three player like ipod . um so we 've already addressed that and i think that would actually be worse for something like r_s_i_ i mean you got that thumb movement that you 're constantly doing . project manager : yeah . user interface : um the other suggestion , marketing : that does get annoying . user interface : and i i have a feeling that we 're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : or uh something for the elderly , where the remote 's very large and the buttons are very large and there 's only a few buttons . but you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . project manager : yeah . user interface : uh um so , the key layout and design are really crucial . you do n't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . and i did n't mention that we need a power button in our last i can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout industrial designer : user interface : uh from our manufacturing department . so this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a v_ on both of them , so uh project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : it 's sort of confusing for the user . uh this is the example of the giant remote that 's impossible to lose . project manager : do we have an uh example of a good one ? brilliant . industrial designer : marketing : uh-huh . well user interface : and for something for kids . yeah . um . project manager : yeah . user interface : and so , yeah , i th i think my personal preferences of we 've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . uh so i was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . i think it should be more general . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : i did n't i did n't think the spinning-wheel or the uh l_c_ display were were crucial for us . and , yeah , that 's it for me . project manager : okay . well let 's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? the um the the um the interface type we 're going for user interface : so we 're we 're not gon na have any sort of display i think uh . project manager : just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . user interface : so , yeah , it 's just gon na be just gon na be push-buttons . um . i think we shall have a limited number of buttons , project manager : yeah . user interface : ideally , i mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . project manager : yeah . user interface : uh . and some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . project manager : yeah . user interface : i guess it 's to the point where we need to decide about that . project manager : okay , and we 're not yeah . user interface : well now that we 've decided on our project manager : are we gon na hav hav an are we d marketing : project manager : have we decided on whether w we 're gon na s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we 're not we 're just gon na go for something user interface : um it seems like we would n't wan na make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , project manager : we 're marketing : maybe we can user interface : but um yeah , i would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the r_r_ can be yellow , or something like that . project manager : yeah . yeah . okay . okey-dokey . yeah , i do n't have any other questions on this . let 's move over to user interface : i i guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . project manager : yeah , sure . user interface : i mean , 'cause uh s so if we wan na have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . project manager : . user interface : but i think that should be i mean um , i can speak with the button department , but uh i think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . project manager : yeah , the button that just does that , yeah . user interface : so that should be simple ."
