    "answer": "marketing : i 've i 've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah , maybe we should see yours first . user interface : oh okay . marketing : cool . right , um i 've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one that 's the one i talked about last time , that we 'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . and we 've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . so we 've had people in paris and milan watching the uh fashion trends . industrial designer : project manager : you know yourself . marketing : so user interface : marketing : so just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . the most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : and second , there should be some technological innovation . and then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . and apparently , the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : um but um the feel of the material should be spongy , industrial designer : marketing : which is contrary to last year , apparently . i presume it must have been not not spongy last year . project manager : user interface : marketing : so we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . and then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . and then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that 's as a third priority , so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we 've as we 've discussed . user interface : marketing : and then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people 's imaginations . so maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic . and then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana or something like that . right , so that 'll be it . user interface : marketing : maybe a banana or courgette or something . project manager :"
