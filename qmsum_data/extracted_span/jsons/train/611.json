    "query": "<s> what did hon . ahmed hussen think about the bill for the disabilities ?",
    "answer": "ms. louise chabot ( thrse-de blainville , bq ) : madamchair , i will come back to the bill introduced last week . as parliamentarians , we felt like we were watching a very bad play , as i imagine the public did . i say that it was theatre , even though it should n't be in this place . the government decided to stage a play and act alone and , unfortunately , there were several acts missing . a very important part of this bill was about supporting people with disabilities in this time of crisis . however , the government did not see fit to negotiate with the opposition parties , even though it is in a minority position . despite this arrogance , the bloc qubcois proposed solutions . one of the things we proposed was to split the bill so that we could give this support to people with disabilities , but the conservatives did not want to do that . we came back and asked for time to negotiate and give support to people with disabilities , but the government defeated the motion . we asked that the house be recalled today so that we could pass this part of the bill concerning support for people with disabilities , but we are still in the dark . why are we abandoning people with disabilities ? hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : i thank the hon . member for her question . we know this pandemic has deeply affected the lives and health of all canadians and has disproportionately affected canadians with disabilities in particular . from the very beginning , we 've taken a disability-inclusive approach to our emergency response to ensure that canadians with disabilities get the support they need . that is why we announced a one-time payment of $ 600 for persons with disabilities to address these expenses . this will go a long way toward helping canadians with disabilities . we encourage and urge all parties in the opposition to support this measure . we 're confident that this measure , along with other investments , will benefit canadians with disabilities , and we hope to get the support of the other parties very soon . ms. louise chabot : madamchair , i remind you that this measure was n't passed because we were n't allowed to do so . a measure to help people with disabilities has been put in an omnibus bill . we 've tried here , in the house , to provide the means to give that support , so i ask again , can the government be counted on to give a response to people with disabilities ? hon . pablo rodriguez : madamchair , it was absolutely not an omnibus bill . it contained assistance for the disabled , of course , but it also contained assistance for our seasonal workers , as well as a number of other measures that the bloc qubcois opposed . they refused to debate and , when the question of splitting the bill came up , the conservatives refused to do that . that is why there is no bill at the moment , and that is very unfortunate . ms. louise chabot : it was a bloc qubcois proposal to split the bill . the government had not thought of it , but they found that it was a good idea . let me return to the attack . this bill proposed changes to the wage subsidy program , it was supposed to make the cerb more flexible , it proposed fines for fraudsters and , since there was a little section about a benefit for the disabled , the government took it for granted that we would support it without any negotiations with the parties . however , we set one very important condition : that the liberal party must get its hands out of taxpayers ' pockets in terms of the wage subsidy . hon . pablo rodriguez : madamchair , as we listen to the bloc qubcois members , we might think that they invented peanut butter and apple pie . this bill contained a number of measures that all quebeckers and all canadians needed , but the bloc qubcois refused to debate it . no , we did not follow the bloc qubcois ' example in splitting the bill ; we had thought of it a long time previously . we have not been able to do that because of the conservatives . because of them , we can not help those living with disabilities . the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : ms.chabot , you have 45seconds left . ms. louise chabot : we asked on a number of occasions for the house to be able to sit starting today to pass the part of the bill dealing with those with disabilities . what is the status of that , madamchair ? we have not heard about it since ."
