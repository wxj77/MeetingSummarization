    "answer": "grad d : right . professor f : no . so y you did n't yet tell us what the output is . grad d : the output . professor f : so what decisions does this make ? grad d : ok . so it only makes two decisions , in this model . and one is basically how desirable a site is meaning , um , how good it matches the needs of a user . and the other is the mode of the visit , whether th it 's the eva decision . um , so , instead of um , doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of the user wants to visit , i 'll come well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites . and for each site , you know , where h how how well it fits , and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it . so . anything else i missed ? professor f : so that was pretty quick . she 's ac uh uh eva 's got a little write - up on it that uh , probably gives the the details to anybody who needs them . um , so the you you did n't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation . grad d : no , not yet , um professor f : ok . so one so one of the questions , you know , about these p r ms is grad d : mm - hmm . professor f : uh , we are n't gon na build our own interpreter , so if if we ca n't find one , then we uh , go off and do something else and wait until s one appears . uh , so one of the things that eva 's gon na do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down . uh , the people at stanford write papers as if they had one , but , um , we 'll see . so w anyway . so that 's a a major open issue . if there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually um , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it . uh , and we 'll see . uh , i actually think it is cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , um , will help in the expression . whether the inference gets any faster or not i do n't know . uh , it would n't surprise me if it if it does n't . grad d : mm - hmm . professor f : you know , it 's the same kind of information . i think there are things that you can express this way which you ca n't express in a normal belief - net , uh , without going to some incredible hacking of sort of rebuilding it on the fly . i mean , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and does n't fit very well into the extended belief - net . so that was one of the main reasons for doing it . um . i do n't know . so , uh , people who have thought about the problem , like robert i it looked to me like if { comment } eva were able to come up with a you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its eva thing , that a travel planner should be able to take it from there . and you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever , and then plan a route . grad b : um - hmm , um , well , first of all uh , uh , great looks , mu much cleaner , nnn , nnn , certain certain beauty in it , so , um , if beauty is truth , then , uh we 're in good shape . but , the um , as , uh , mentioned before we probably should look at t the details . so if you have a write - up then uh , i 'd love to read it grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : and uh because , um , i can you go all the way back to the the very top ? grad d : yeah . grad b : um , uh these @ @ { comment } these w w when these are instantiated they take on the same values ? that we had before ? grad d : i ca n't really see the whole thing . grad b : or are they have they changed , in a sense ? grad d : well i think i basically leave them to similar things . grad b : uh - huh . grad d : some of the things might that might be different , maybe like are that the hours for the site . and , eventually i meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not . grad b : uh - huh . grad d : and status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction , and and or stuff like that . grad b : and the , uh , other question i would have is that presumably , from the way the stanford people talk about it , you can put the probabilities also on the relations . if grad d : which is the structural uncertainty ? professor f : yeah . yeah , i that 's that i think was actually in the previous the ubenth stuff . i do n't remember whether they carried that over to this or not , uh , structural uncertainty ."
