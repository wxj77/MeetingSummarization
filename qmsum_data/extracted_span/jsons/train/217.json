    "answer": "project manager : oh that . it wo n't does n't maybe we should start with the the technical functions . industrial designer : okay , project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : how can i get this on the whiteboard ? project manager : well it 's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . user interface : in project . industrial designer : okay , i 've done that . project manager : you 've already done that ? user interface : no can that open . project manager : well let 's close this one . we 'll just uh open a new one . user interface : open it there . project manager : uh , well . yes . uh-oh . new thing . oh yeah , uh i have to say something . uh , due to some uh technical problems i have n't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . but i 'll uh make sure that uh happens next time . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : okay . about the get project manager : and i 'll get this one uh in digital uh form too . industrial designer : 'kay , we 're going to um uh talk about working design . um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . it 's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . mm , it 's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . um , the known technology can make a cost very low . uh , it 's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . and and the components are very uh very cheap . um , uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh led lights , they 're needed and they 're uh everywhere available . uh , again , it 's a fair price . it 's a common uh technology uh , like i told um uh , the circuit board , it 's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it 's it is uh can be made as fast as printing paper . it 's uh it 's all very uh project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah , they 're making it uh all the time . uh , project manager : okay . industrial designer : and it 's not uh very specialised uh technology . i have n't come to here , but um i 've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . they were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows . so i do n't know uh why i should put it here . uh project manager : okay . but it 's the technical side of the remote control . user interface : industrial designer : yes , but uh i uh have n't made it because uh of the time . project manager : oh . okay . well , we 'll we 'll have to skip that part then . industrial designer : what ? user interface : okay . project manager : but you do n't think it 's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? it 's gon na be easy ? industrial designer : no . yes . project manager : okay . user interface : but nothing restricted for user interface ? project manager : yeah . m user interface : with technical industrial designer : um , no , it 's uh it 's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah . user interface : i do n't know . project manager : okay . user interface : 'kay . industrial designer : remote control is nothing special nowadays . project manager : r regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . does n't really matter . user interface : okay . industrial designer : um user interface : but i kind of uh industrial designer : i do n't think so , project manager : okay . yeah , okay . industrial designer : because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , user interface : yes . uh project manager : okay . industrial designer : but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ? project manager : well , we 'll see . we 'll see later on . user interface : well , the technical functions . um , well i do n't know if you got the same uh pictures as i got , but uh i got these two , and i think they 're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . th i think it 's it 's very much uh depending on the user requirements , i do n't s uh know who 's doing t project manager : well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? the ones i i 've uh received from the account manager . user interface : yeah , but it i think that 's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control . project manager : yeah . well , we 'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on . user interface : yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it . project manager : uh-huh . okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v marketing : yes , i agree . yeah . project manager : yeah ? well , what that 's what you want trying to say . user interface : well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . project manager : okay . okay . user interface : but i do n't know . it 's it 's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use . project manager : yeah , well some of these uh , yeah . well , some of that will yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements . user interface : yeah , probably , yeah . project manager : so user interface : uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . i think that 's just basic what we need . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and from that on we can user requirements what we need more . uh yeah , i just um um i thought joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and i do n't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it 's com becoming less trendy or something like that . m you can just you can k marketing : i have n't really found a conclusion like that . user interface : you can keep it in mind that . marketing : yeah . user interface : i do n't know . uh , i th i thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh marketing : design . user interface : yeah , more trendier design , i think . i think . marketing : sounds interesting . project manager : user interface : yeah ? marketing : user interface : uh , well , that 's all i have to say , i think . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah , that was it . marketing : alright . project manager : well , then the marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market . marketing : yes . user interface : . marketing : yeah . it 's alright . um alright , i 've done some research for functional requirements . um yes . the working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . uh , i 've lined them up here . uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . i uh have found some interesting things . we do we do got a market . um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . so if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as i uh quoted here from the uh results . zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . that 's quite a lot . um , relevant options are , of course , power buttons . although , only used once per hour . uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . that does n't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . but it sure um says we should n't make it too uh complicated . fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . and um an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . and uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . so , what i was thinking oh , wrong side . we should n't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . group features for a higher usability , uh what i was claiming in the previous meeting . um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . project manager : okay . marketing : and um , if you want to implement v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ options , group them in the button , not too uh yeah . small buttons , so they wo n't be very um , how do you say project manager : visually presents . marketing : yes , wo n't be very present , thank you . and a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who do n't really care for trendy looks or whatever , i guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . that was kind of what i found . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : okay . project manager : well , then we i 'm gon na show you some of the new project requirements and then we gon na discuss on uh what features we find important . marketing : yes . project manager : uh , well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , i think . marketing : project manager : because um uh s decided to put they have decide to put two additional requirements forward . well , now i see four . marketing : two ? project manager : that 's kinda strange . well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . well , i think that may be so , but well , we ca n't just leave the teletext button off . user interface : well project manager : it 's impossible , i think . user interface : no way . marketing : no uh , i agree , i agree . project manager : so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and do n't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or marketing : not too much , no . project manager : you know , it 's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we have to think of that . the remote control should only be used for television . otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . so maybe we should leave all d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ related features off completely . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : i do n't know . i think that uh that 's what they 're trying to say . marketing : project manager : uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . new products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . so you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but , well , they 're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger marketing : i do n't really agree actually , to be honest . it 's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . it 's only like thirty percent of the total market . project manager : yeah , but it is it 's is a dif it 's a fact that the th th that bigger market you 're talking about , we already cover that . marketing : mayb yeah ? project manager : our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . that 's the one we have n't covered yet . so i think that 's what the problem is . we have n't got remote controls for uh marketing : okay . project manager : well i think , yeah . marketing : maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . project manager : yeah , i think so . maybe if it 's marketing : not too much then , bu alright . project manager : no no , but i think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . so maybe we can make a remote control that 's primarily interesting for the younger group , but is n't that bad for an older person either . uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . our product 's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . okay , something else nice to know . user interface : but what 's our slogan ? project manager : sorry ? yeah , you will have to look that up . user interface : the slogan uh marketing : yeah , i 'll have a look . project manager : i think it 's something about the user interface : puts fashion in electronics . marketing : we put the fashion in electronics . project manager : oh , okay . i thought it w might be , let 's make things better or something , but user interface : sense simplicity . marketing : sense and simplicity . project manager : okay well , let 's go back to the the agenda . so we 've now had to the three presentations . we know about the new project requirements . that means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . well , if i can uh make a start , i think it 's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it 's gon na be , and i already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . i think we 're we 're looking for some marketing : project manager : yeah , we we 're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic tv functions . y well , that user interface : yeah . marketing : well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that 's not very uh yeah , we do n't really need to have a simple remote control . project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : i think we can implement more functions then , because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology user interface : yeah , but wha project manager : yeah , yeah . marketing : and therefore will be a more project manager : m yeah , that 's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , i think they are are c are contradicting each other , user interface : but project manager : because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just tv , but they s do aim at a younger marketing : yes . project manager : well , ma user interface : yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions are n't used . marketing : yeah . user interface : so why should j we put this function in ? marketing : well , i think user interface : i think more i think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions . industrial designer : project manager : but i think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have y well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t tv and a d_v_d_ player . you can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the tv set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . we do n't want that . i think that was that became clear . we do n't want . but w maybe we should put some func uh , i know that the younger people will most likely have a d_v_d_ player they want to , you know , they want to uh marketing : yeah , control . user interface : yeah , but uh you said project manager : control , remotely . user interface : yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we 're making . marketing : project manager : no , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the the new project requirements told us not to user interface : it 's n yeah . project manager : but maybe w yeah . i think we maybe should user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . but just the basic functions . maybe like rewind and wind , or n what d what do you guys think ? industrial designer : but you can put them under the same button . marketing : not much more than that . project manager : yeah , if as far as possible . marketing : yep . or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever . project manager : but what do you think ? do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ? no , you do n't think so ? marketing : user interface : no , new requirements say no . project manager : yeah , the new requirements say so . user interface : so industrial designer : but you can put a play and stop and and rewind . project manager : well , maybe it 's marketing : yeah . project manager : maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions do n't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . user interface : yeah , but project manager : you know , a lot of d_v_d_ players have some tricky settings with industrial designer : yes , but we user interface : i i if it 's too simple uh th they wo n't use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions . marketing : y yes . project manager : yep , exactly . that 's that 's wha marketing : but but for for example , v_c_r_ , that 's better example in this case . i think on a remote control for television you do n't need to be able to programme uh the v_c_r_ to start recording at three p_m_ or whatever , project manager : no no , you do n't no no , you do n't need it . no , no . user interface : no , no . exactly . marketing : just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward . project manager : okay , but we have to think uh w we have to think d_v_d_ i th uh , i guess , marketing : yeah , i know , but uh project manager : so um but uh from my experience it 's kinda a lot of d_v_d_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . it 's c sometimes a bit difficult . user interface : mm , yeah . project manager : maybe if we just leave the d_v_d_ functional m uh well , i was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , i think we m should focus on the tv then . marketing : yes . user interface : yeah , but just keep it simple and look more at th project manager : and uh and it 's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . if you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . user interface : no . it 's only for television . so project manager : okay . it 's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , industrial designer : yes , but there are there are project manager : and it 's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , nothing more . exactly . project manager : okay . marketing : alright . project manager : um , but what televis industrial designer : but how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? there are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have project manager : yeah , we we 'll make w this one trendy . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : and simple . user interface : the user interface is easy . project manager : well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . so we should put uh zap buttons on it . um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels . user interface : and the basic yeah , basic functions , yeah . marketing : yes , definitely , yeah . user interface : it 's too much integrated in the other . project manager : okay , a t a teletext button should be there . but just one big teletext button , on and off . user interface : yeah . project manager : probably . marketing : yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that . i think stop function is very useful . if you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , project manager : oh , okay . marketing : then i think it 's very irritating if the next page shows up , but project manager : yeah , but uh i think that becomes too difficult , it 's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . marketing : well , i use it very regularly , the action . i re i use it quite often . project manager : yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but i 've never heard of it in the first place . and user interface : will you look marketing : industrial designer : project manager : we have to well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . user interface : look at the market . project manager : we just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . yeah . i do n't know . i think that that 's kin getting too complex for our remote . user interface : well project manager : i do n't know what you th guys think . marketing : might be . might be . user interface : yeah , i uh , it 's sunday i always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh project manager : yeah , but do you like to have a such a s stop button ? or do you think it uh i think it 's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function . user interface : well , uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um , a couple of weeks ago i looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th project manager : yeah . okay , it goes yeah , but that 's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . that 's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements . industrial designer : yes , but you could put user interface : yeah , but industrial designer : on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . project manager : well yeah uh , industrial designer : if you have seven pages , you can go up and down . project manager : lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using i think we should just put one teletext button on it . user interface : true . project manager : then we meet uh the new requirements . we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , i guess . user interface : a simple yeah . project manager : okay . um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ? or do we uh i dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . we have the zap and uh the volume . should we do m make them very big ? the the the zap button . d d marketing : i think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , project manager : th that 's that 's that 's considered to be trendy also . user interface : but trendy , yeah . project manager : or maybe you should place them on a uh , in a special way ? user interface : i do n't know . industrial designer : maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick . project manager : yeah , something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah , and quick . you have to use it very quickly . user interface : original . it was uh true . marketing : if you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus . project manager : yeah , and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace . oh , what should we decide on then ? i think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh were n't worked out already , but it w should n't be a problem then . industrial designer : but user interface : yeah . industrial designer : no , it 's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest . user interface : maybe uh project manager : no , okay , but we do n't have to uh , when we do n't want to uh control other devices , i think it makes it even more simple . user interface : uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe . if you use large batteries or small batter batteries . project manager : i think industrial designer : the most standard batteries . project manager : i think that we should use uh d user interface : yeah ? marketing : i think double a_ . project manager : yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh well , it has to be simple , and i wi user interface : yeah . marketing : the most ordinary uh batteries . project manager : which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know ."
