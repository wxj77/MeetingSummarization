    "answer": "project manager : okay , well i think we 're ready to begin . right , my name 's adam duguid , we 're here because of real reaction , um , we have in the group marketing : oh , ebenezer ademesoye . would you like me to spell that ? project manager : um , yeah , go for it mate . marketing : um , n_e_z_ project manager : n_ e_ z_ . marketing : e_r_ . project manager : ebenezer . and your role is ? marketing : i 'm the marketing expert . project manager : you 're the marketing expert , okay . next we have ? industrial designer : tarik rahman . t_a_r_i_k_ . project manager : t_ r_ i_ k_ . and your role in this is ? industrial designer : industrial designer . project manager : industrial designer . and , lastly we have ? user interface : uh , dave cochrane . project manager : and you 're going to be the user interface , user interface : user interface defin designer , yes . project manager : is it ? designer . okay . right . this is the agenda for today 's meeting . as you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . so , the reason we 're here , we 're gon na design a new remote control , as you probably all know . the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . course , we 'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh personally i think that the original is gon na be a very key aspect to this design . um , there 's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we 're gon na need something that 's really gon na set it apart . this is how today seems to be going to work . we 're gon na have the three kay phases , as you 've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . um first one 's gon na be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . of course , you 've all got the similar emails , i believe , right . what can i say ? ebenezer , you wan na have a you wan na draw your favourite animal ? industrial designer : marketing : sure . whiteboard . 'kay . s okay . i will make this quick , since we do n't have much time . um . 'kay , so it 's not the best picture in the world . project manager : marketing : here we have an elephant . first point , begins with an e_ , same like ebenezer . also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , industrial designer : marketing : and i ca n't remember back when i used to live back in nigeria , but i think i used to have a pet elephant . so elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter e_ , just like ebenezer . project manager : brilliantly done . thank you . marketing : thank you . project manager : tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? industrial designer : . project manager : oh , um , marketing : oh . oh oh project manager : you can clip them to your belt . industrial designer : do we take them off ? marketing : i think you ga industrial designer : oh right , project manager : you should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well . industrial designer : okay . marketing : the little the the industrial designer : ah-ha . marketing : oh that 's good , we can clip them on . okay . yeah , industrial designer : now where do i put the marketing : just um somewhere project manager : yep , the , it 's just across there , that 's it . yep . industrial designer : is this supposed to be clipped as well ? project manager : yeah . marketing : i think so . project manager : it 'll follow you if you marketing : yeah . there you go . project manager : you can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , i would n't worry too much . should have good range . industrial designer : uh , destroying your elephant here . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : uh , here we have a tiger . uh i 've always loved tigers . they 're just they 're big , they 're biggest cats , uh i did a project on cats in the wild when i was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was looks the best , the stripes , orange . my dad used to talk about he 's from bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when i was a kid . and uh they 're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild . so uh that 's why i like them . did n't say an anything about me really but project manager : excellent , thank you very much . dave , if you 'd like to uh have a dash . user interface : um um , the monkey , um . the one f uh in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh well my i have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as miss monkey . um , monkeys have attitude . which i think is a good thing . and i mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . um , so i like monkeys . and and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . industrial designer : project manager : cheers . hardly what i 'd call the best drawing in the world but it 'll do for now . also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they 're very independent , they 're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . right . i think we 've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . project finance . as you can see , twelve point five euros per unit . that 's not a terrible lot as far as i 'm aware , and we 're hoping to sell them for twenty five . if we 're aiming for fifty million euros we 're gon na have to be selling an awful lot of them . marketing : oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that 's the amount made , okay . project manager : well , fifty million , and if you 're making twelve point five euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . so i 'm gon na guess that we 've all used remote controls . any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? user interface : well , one thing i 'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there 's there 's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen lcd remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um i mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it 's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the tv to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the v_c_r_ and get it to play once it 's rewound , for instance . project manager : okay . user interface : um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . and therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . project manager : okay , yeah , tha that 's true , with the price range we 're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our user interface : absolutely prohibitive , project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : but you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . user interface : yeah , i mean i would n't like to say you g i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros . project manager : would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the tv , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of user interface : for instance , um let 's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the d_v_d_ player and it turns the tv on and onto the right channel as well , um project manager : okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . um any takes on this ? marketing : well um i 've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , um when i was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . project manager : okay . marketing : so perhaps one that was more um specialised for game playing or interactive television . they they 've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , project manager : okay . marketing : and slide another bar to say what time it ends , you know that 's project manager : yeah i 've heard i 've seen the bar-code design before , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , it 's it 's taken out the y you do n't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . i think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . project manager : marketing : uh , you wan na be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that . project manager : okay , well industrial designer : 'kay . project manager : we 're beginning to run out of time now , so , we 've got a couple of ideas , marketing : yeah . project manager : we can we 'll have to work fast , um , alright as you can see we 've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so we 'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that 'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . um user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : and we 're gon na maybe n try and have to figure out marketing : what the user wants uh . project manager : what the user wants , yes . marketing : okay . project manager : um , right . has anybody got anything they 'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ? industrial designer : well when you 're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? marketing : oh . okay , . industrial designer : like uh control pads , you know of games , but marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : or is that a bit ridiculous ? project manager : i i do n't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it 's probably an interface that most people are used to . um industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . user interface : mm-hmm . the other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . but of course , uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , . project manager : okay . so , user interface : a curve , project manager : small , stylish , and something that 's just a little different . user interface : mm-hmm . something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway . project manager : okay . that 's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily . i would i would have hoped so anyway . um , right . i 'd say we finish this one up , we get started , i 'll get in , i 'll write up what we 've um kind of quickly done , and i 'll get that out to everybody . yeah ? marketing : 'kay . so . project manager : okay . marketing : . industrial designer : ."
