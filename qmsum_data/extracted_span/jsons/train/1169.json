    "answer": "industrial designer : and um well i i will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . user interface : industrial designer : so uh can you go one page down , please . so i think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . user interface : industrial designer : so uh mm i 'm thin uh i think uh i i 'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . then uh i will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like . user interface : industrial designer : and how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . user interface : industrial designer : and when we are ready with this first prototype i i think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . okay so can you go down uh so , wha what i think for now is we do n't want to have a remote control w which is wired user interface : project manager : industrial designer : so uh i think we u we can use a battery for the . then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . and the communication with the tv set is uh made through uh infrared communication so uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls user interface : did you draw it ? marketing : project manager : wow . industrial designer : so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the tv set . user interface : this . project manager : this user interface : what is the other chip for ? the one on top . industrial designer : the one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities user interface : marketing : one is a communication . industrial designer : and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the tv set . user interface : for men . to the in okay . industrial designer : and , that 's it . i think we should use a f_p_g_a_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t user interface : mm . what is f_p_g_a_ ? industrial designer : it 's field programmable uh something array . marketing : gateway arrays . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it 's a field programmable gateway arrays . user interface : so why 's it how is it different from the bluetooth ? industrial designer : well , uh a f_p_g_a_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . user interface : yeah . programme it . marketing : yeah . user interface : okay . industrial designer : and uh well the bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . user interface : yeah . uh so this are the they have to work together ? or ? do they have to work together or two separate choice industrial designer : no . well , th the f_p_g_a_ will produce the the data to send . user interface : okay . marketing : or it 's something like is n't hardware the first one ? and the second one is for the software . user interface : is the is the software par alri okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah to run th to make it run . user interface : okay , okay . marketing : that 's it . user interface : so you can control if you want , right ? industrial designer : yeah . alright and that 's it for the working design . user interface : industrial designer : so if you have any questions ? marketing : okay , and how about the battery power ? uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? industrial designer : uh no no no no , i think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the project manager : . marketing : into the industrial designer : yeah into the t . marketing : more compact and uh okay , industrial designer : yeah , yeah . user interface : industrial designer : and uh i i do n't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run , so user interface : mm . mm . marketing : yeah , yeah . okay . user interface : mm . you can put it on the charger when uh you when you do n't need to use it . industrial designer : yeah . it 's a good idea . marketing : yeah , that 's right . user interface : yeah . marketing : having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : people do n't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . user interface : yeah . mm . uh mm . marketing : we just make a small charger user interface : y yeah , yeah . marketing : and put it project manager : you can i yeah . user interface : because you are using because you are using bluetooth , if some people have p_d_a_ they can use their p_d_a_ to control the tv if they want to , right ? industrial designer : that 's a good idea . marketing : industrial designer : also , but but i i i think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control . project manager : user interface : i dunno . marketing : bu project manager : yeah we can change the b . marketing : our remote , project manager : yeah . marketing : we do not want to make it p_d_a_ . user interface : industrial designer : s okay , so charger for is the . user interface : so is mine . project manager : it 's mine . participant one , no ?"
