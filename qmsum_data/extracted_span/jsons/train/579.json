    "query": "<s> what did working with local authorities actually mean ?",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : yes , absolutely . so , i 'm hoping to make an announcement tomorrow , if not later on this week , about some specific details around support for hardware and connectivity . we 're working closely with local authorities to understand just that : to understand from the schools the number of schools that\u2014and a number of them have already done this\u2014have been lending chromebooks , ipads and laptops to children , and also identifying children who are not perhaps engaging in the activities that have been made available . and we 'll be doing two things to support local authorities . the first is to use the stock of equipment that they already have to be able to provide hardware to students . so , we have purchased on a national basis software that , when applied to an old piece of kit , essentially turns it into an out-of-the-box chromebook . because , as you can imagine , just like other things during a pandemic , there has been a rush to buy new stuff on the market and then there is a scramble and nobody can get what they need . so , we 're utilisng kit that is already available in schools and local authorities , and we will look to backfill that to schools at a later point out of our edtech investment programme . the other issue is , once a child has a chromebook or a laptop or a device , issues around connectivity . so , we 're also looking to purchase on a national level and distribute mi-fi connectivity , so students will be able to have access to wi-fi where they do n't have that already . that 's why we need to work closely with local authorities and schools to identify the level of that need and to make sure the stuff gets to the right children . one of the ways in which we are able to do that is to look at engagement in education . so , if a child has n't been engaging , is that because they just do n't want to and they 're voting with their feet\u2014but clearly teachers need to have a conversation about that\u2014or is that because the child simply does not have the ability to do that , and therefore we need to get that stuff out to those children ? so , rather than just simply leaving it to local authorities to scramble around in a very crowded market to get the stuff that they will need , we 're trying to do that on a national basis and deploy that to local authorities . so , our officials have been having conversations with each of our local authorities to ascertain what 's already happened , and there is very good practice out there\u2014schools have been proactive\u2014but where there are gaps , what can we do as a national government to be able to assist them to do that ? we are repurposing some of the resources that we had previously identified for our edtech investment , using those resources to fill this particular gap ."
