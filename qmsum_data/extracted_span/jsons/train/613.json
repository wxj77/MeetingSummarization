    "answer": "hon . steven blaney : the workers do not need words ; they need contracts and jobs . the same is true for young people who want to work . there is money in the canada summer jobs program : in my constituency alone , $ 150,000has been approved . companies want young people to work and want to hire them . what is the minister waiting for in order to confirm those positions ? in my constituency , and everywhere else in the country , our young people want to work . what is the government waiting for in order to send some cash to the canada summer jobs program ? hon . ahmed hussen : madam chair , we are proud of the canada summer jobs program . we are introducing flexibilities into the system to enable employers to be able to hire summer students . we recognize the importance of this program to provide both financial resources and necessary experience for young people . we believe in continuing to invest in the canada summer jobs program . hon . steven blaney : the workers , the young people and the employers have been waiting for weeks . the money is available ; where is the announcement ? madamchair , our young people are not the only ones who want to work . there are also the temporary foreign workers . let me use jessie gito as an example ; he has been working at plate2000 in saint-anselme for years . when the time came to renew his work permit , he found out that he has to have some biometric tests . but he can not get them because the offices are closed . is the minister going to allow jessie gito and the thousands of other temporary foreign workers who want to work to be able to do so until the government biometric testing centres reopen ?"
