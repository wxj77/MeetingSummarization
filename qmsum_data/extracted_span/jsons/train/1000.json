    "answer": "project manager : , advanced chip . and then we get to the point of the case . um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . uh if we wan na choose for wood or the black and grey . or both ? um as we saw there is not yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um but i think it will attract elderly people who wan na have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : look i 've got a new remote control , and uh industrial designer : user interface : uh i dunno . marketing : well and i think most important factor there is the wooden colour . so it would n't actually have to be wood , project manager : yeah . that 's right . marketing : if it 's just wood-coloured . project manager : but with colour was a lot more expensive ? or ? industrial designer : mm i dunno . project manager : you do n't know ? industrial designer : i 'll have to uh research . project manager : i think so because yeah . marketing : probably . project manager : it 's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . user interface : mm . uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . so um uh you 'cause uh yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . project manager : yeah . change the cases . yeah . user interface : maybe it 's possible uh possibility . so um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh project manager : you can sell the cases . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . i think that 's a very good option . because um then you can advertise as well with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : because that 's a it 's something extra , it 's something other remotes do n't have , user interface : yeah . project manager : which we can get a great advantage point . marketing : yeah that is true . project manager : so and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as well . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . we would have to look carefully into the design though . project manager : costs . marketing : 'cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . the more original one , or the more standard one . project manager : yeah . yeah . so marketing : so that would project manager : you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . marketing : well i would n't design a telephone industrial designer : marketing : but user interface : marketing : well no i think w we should just , we should then just design one um project manager : remote . marketing : one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . project manager : yeah . okay . marketing : so , but that should n't be too much of a problem . project manager : so everybody 's okay with the changing covers ? i think that 's a good uh good option . user interface : yeah . project manager : changing case covers . marketing : um i heard our industrial designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . project manager : yeah . marketing : could you explain that a little more ? industrial designer : well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . marketing : and what would single curved and double curved mean ? industrial designer : um it would just only affect the form , for as far as i know . so it 's j really just up to the design department what we 're gon na use . it does n't really matter for the price or the functionality . marketing : okay . so we can pretty much just do whatever we want . industrial designer : pick one you like , yes . project manager : mm . okay . marketing : 'kay . that 's good . project manager : uh but the form has to be um it has to it 's has to be possible to stand up ? or just only to lie down ? marketing : no just to lie down . user interface : okay . project manager : and the the cover of the the docking station is also marketing : we 'll go for that . project manager : on top of the television then ? or not ? marketing : well or besides it . project manager : and you can just yeah then click it in . that 's okay . um so the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ? um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : on the the board . does somebody have ideas for a form or user interface : uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it 's um not quite uh fancy . so um yeah . marketing : um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , user interface : yeah . marketing : so you could , so your thumb would be easily user interface : yeah . marketing : well uh i think that was a very good point 'cause i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause r_s_i_ . so that would be great for that . um i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . user interface : for uh uh for marketing : for left-handed users also . user interface : yeah yeah . mm . yeah we is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? and on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? or or is n't it ? marketing : for the volume . um well that could yeah we could do that but i 'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . project manager : usabili yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , user interface : yeah okay . project manager : and then it 's marketing : but if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . 'cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . project manager : but you have extra buttons . user interface : but project manager : so people can get confused . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : that is true . user interface : yeah . project manager : especially if they have the same writings on it . user interface : see um yeah . or we have to make a left uh for lefties project manager : ca n't we make uh ca n't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same user interface : and um project manager : functions as the normal one ? user interface : you mean um project manager : then you have to user interface : yeah if project manager : let 's see if i ca a blank one . and then you get here 's a little lcd screen . uh now i have to think . it 's a plus and a min . no it 's not very handy i think . because the plus and the min will be opposite user interface : mm no . project manager : and all kinds of user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : no that 's not gon na work . i guess . maybe we should user interface : um project manager : yeah . but is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? i think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel marketing : yeah . that is true . project manager : or user interface : yeah . it 's just uh u using uh your thumb . project manager : y yeah . yeah . user interface : so um it 's project manager : i think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . in one or ano another way . user interface : yeah . um industrial designer : i think we should start by by choosing a case . because that 's the basis you 're building on . user interface : yeah yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : um yeah industrial designer : so i could draw them out . project manager : just industrial designer : let 's look at the flat case . oh . it 's from the side so it 's rather normal . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the the single curved so i 'm not really sure what they 're gon na look like , but i think it 's something like this . so this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . project manager : easier ? industrial designer : and the double curved s looks something like this i guess . so th those are the three options we have . project manager : 'kay . i suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it 's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . user interface : so um do you say this um s uh uh you got like uh sort of a i believe there ? marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : so um you want to put a display over here ? or not ? project manager : yeah . i think so . yeah . user interface : yeah . um yeah . uh project manager : but now it 's user interface : we can make it um project manager : do you have it upside down or do you have it user interface : that 's the top . project manager : this that 's top ? okay . user interface : so uh this top . this down . um maybe it 's possible to uh make this side like um let 's see . um colour uh okay . uh to make this side um like mm the right colour . project manager : user interface : um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . so um uh it 's an project manager : yeah . user interface : so so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . so uh it 's possib um yeah for s so and project manager : so get your mouse . yeah . user interface : and to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh project manager : yeah . that 's a good one . but i think it 's better to put the screen uh on top . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : uh rem project manager : so just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here . user interface : yeah but this place um project manager : if you can have this one , you turn it like this . and then flip it upside down . user interface : uh it 's yeah i dunno um project manager : because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : it 's more logical to have it on top as well project manager : i think i industrial designer : because , like on your mobile phone , it 's always above . user interface : yeah so project manager : on top . marketing : yeah . user interface : so project manager : yeah . user interface : industrial designer : oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page . project manager : . so marketing : yeah . project manager : then we get here 's that 's the curve . user interface : five minutes . project manager : here the display , and then buttons . yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . just that 's for left hand and right hand users . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and then h the rest of the buttons over here . user interface : yeah . but um the on-off button , um still on the top uh project manager : yeah still here user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : that 's marketing : and i 'd prefer the corners to be round . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . 'kay . project manager : should be more bit more friendly , marketing : think that would be better . project manager : yeah ."
