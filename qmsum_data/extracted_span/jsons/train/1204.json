    "answer": "phd b : the data ? grad a : right . right . i mean , so we 're we 're collecting a corpus and i think it 's gon na be generally useful . i mean , it seems like it 's not a corpus which is uh , has been done before . and so i think people will be interested in having having it , and so we will undergrad d : u using , like , audio d v ds or something like that ? grad a : excuse me ? undergrad d : audio d v grad a : well , or something . yeah , audio d v c ds , you know . undergrad d : yeah . tapes . grad a : and and so how we do we distribute the transcripts , how do we distribute the audio files , how do we how do we just do all that infrastructure ? phd c : well , i think i mean , for that particular issue ther there are known sources where people go to to find these kind of things like the ldc for instance . postdoc e : yeah , grad a : right , but but so should we do it in the same format as ldc postdoc e : that 's right . grad a : and what does that mean to what we 've done already ? phd b : right . the it 's not so much the actu the logistics of distribution are secondary to preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution . phd c : right . grad a : right . so , uh , as it is , it 's sort of a ad - hoc combination of stuff dan set and stuff i set up , which we may wan na make a little more formal . so . phd b : and the other thing is that , um , university of washington may want to start recording meetings as well , grad a : right . phd b : in which case w w we 'll have to decide what we 've actually got so that we can give them a copy . grad a : that 's right . undergrad d : a field trip . grad a : yeah . i was actually thinking i would n't mind spending the summer up there . that would be kind of fun . phd b : oh , really ? grad a : yeah . visit my friends and spend some time phd b : different for you . yes . grad a : well , and then also i have a bunch of stuff for doing this digits . so i have a bunch of scripts with x waves , and some perl scripts , and other things that make it really easy to extract out and align where the digits are . and if u d uw 's going to do the same thing i think it 's worth while for them to do these digits tasks as well . undergrad d : mm - hmm . grad a : and what i 've done is pretty ad - hoc , um , so we might wan na change it over to something a little more standard . you know , stm files , or xml , or something . undergrad d : an - and there 's interest up there ? grad a : what 's that ? undergrad d : there 's interest up there ? grad a : well they they certainly wan na collect more data . and so they 're applying , i think i b is that right ? something like that . phd b : i do n't know . grad a : um , for some more money to do more data . so we were planning to do like thirty or forty hours worth of meetings . they wan na do an additional hundred or so hours . so , they want a very large data set . um , but of course we 're not gon na do that if we do n't get money . so . phd b : i see . grad a : and i would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint room . i mean , one of the things morgan and i were talking about is we 're gon na get to know this room really well , phd c : mm - hmm . grad a : the the acoustics of this room . phd b : all about that . undergrad d : including the fan . grad a : including the fan . undergrad d : did you notice the fan difference ? phd b : oh , now you 've touched the fan control , now all our data 's gon na be undergrad d : hear the difference ? grad a : oh , it 's enormous . phd b : yeah , it 's great . postdoc e : oh , that 's better . undergrad d : do you wan na leave it off or not ? postdoc e : that 's better . grad a : all the others have been on . phd b : that 's undergrad d : yeah , the you sure ? phd b : oh , yeah . grad a : y absolut phd b : absolutely . undergrad d : you you think that grad a : yeah . undergrad d : things after the f then this fan 's wired backwards by the way . uh , i think this is high speed here . postdoc e : yeah , it 's noticeable . undergrad d : well , not clear . phd b : well it 's well like `` low `` is mid mid - scale . undergrad d : maybe it maybe it is n't . phd b : so it could be that it 's not actually wired backwards undergrad d : that 's right . phd b : it 's just that ambiguous . undergrad d : i was wondering also , get ready . { comment } whether the lights made any noise . postdoc e : uh - huh . grad a : there 's definitely yep . phd b : oh , they do . phd c : yeah , a little bit . phd b : yeah . grad a : high pitch hum . wow . undergrad d : so , do our meetings in the dark with no air conditioning in the future . grad a : yeah , just get a variety . postdoc e : i think candles would be nice if they do n't make noise . grad a : they 're very good . phd b : oh , yeah . phd c : it would you know , it would real really mean that we should do short meetings when you turn off the { comment } turn off the air conditioning , grad a : carbon monoxide poisoning ? undergrad d : short meetings , that 's right . or yeah , sort of { comment } r r phd c : got to finish this meeting . undergrad d : tear t tear your clothing off to stay cool . phd c : that 's right . undergrad d : actually , the a th air the air conditioning 's still working , that 's just an auxiliary fan . phd c : right , i see . so , um , in addition to this issue about the uw stuff there was announced today , uh , via the ldc , um , a corpus from i believe santa barbara . postdoc e : yeah , i saw it . i 've been watching for that corpus . phd c : um , of general spoken english . postdoc e : yeah . yep . phd c : and i do n't know exactly how they recorded it but apparently there 's a lot of different styles of speech and what not . grad a : mm - hmm . phd c : and postdoc e : they had people come in to a certain degree and they and they have dat recorders . phd c : i see . so it is sort of far field stuff . right ? postdoc e : i i assume so , actually , i had n't thought about that . unless they added close field later on but , um , i 've listened to some of those data and i , um , i 've been i i was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up . grad a : mm - hmm . phd c : oh , ok . phd b : what 's it sound like ? postdoc e : i 'm glad to see that it got released . grad a : yeah , i i wish postdoc e : so it it 's a very nice thing . grad a : i wish we had someone here working on adaptation because it would nice to be able to take that stuff and adapt it to a meeting setting . you know phd c : but it may be it may be useful in postdoc e : how do you mean do you mean mechanical adaptation or grad a : no , software , to adapt the speech recognition . phd c : well , what i was thinking is it may be useful in transcribing , if it 's far field stuff , grad a : mm - hmm . phd c : right ? in doing , um , some of our first automatic speech recognition models , it may be useful to have that kind of data postdoc e : great idea . phd c : because that 's very different than any kind of data that we have so far . grad a : that 's true . postdoc e : and and their recording conditions are really clean . i mean , i 've i 've heard i 've listened to the data . grad a : well that 's not good , right ? phd c : that 's that 's not great . postdoc e : it sounds well but what i mean is that , um undergrad d : but far field means great distance ? i mean grad a : just these . undergrad d : not head mounted ? phd b : yeah . undergrad d : and so that 's why they 're getting away with just two channels or something , or are they using multiple dats ? postdoc e : um , oh , good question and i ca n't ans answer it . grad a : well we can look into it . postdoc e : i do n't know . phd c : no , and their web their web page did n't answer it either . so i 'm , i uh , was thinking that we should contact them . so it 's that 's sort of a beside - the - point point . but . grad a : so we can get that just with , uh , media costs , undergrad d : still a point . phd c : right . grad a : is that right ? phd c : uh , in fact we get it for free cuz they 're distributing it through the ldc . grad a : great . so that would be yeah , that would be something to look into . so . phd c : so , i can i can actually arrange for it to arrive in short order if we 're postdoc e : the other thing too is from from a grad a : well , it 's silly to do unless we 're gon na have someone to work on it , so maybe we need to think about it a little bit . postdoc e : the other thing too is that their their jus their transcription format is really nice and simple in in the discourse domain . but they also mentioned that they have it time aligned . i mean , i s i i saw that write - up . phd c : yeah . maybe we should maybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they did phd b : yeah , absolutely . grad a : yeah . phd c : so so that we can we can compare . postdoc e : it 's very nice . grad a : ok , why do n't you go ahead and do that then eric ? phd b : absolutely . phd c : alright , i 'll do that . i ca n't remember the name of the corpus . it 's corps - s postdoc e : csae . phd c : s postdoc e : corpus of spoken american english . phd c : right , ok . postdoc e : yeah , sp i 've been i was really pleased to see that . i knew that they they had had some funding problems in completing it phd b : uh - huh . phd c : yeah . postdoc e : but , um , phd c : well they 're postdoc e : this is clever . phd c : apparently this was like phase one postdoc e : got it through the ldc . phd c : and the there 's still more that they 're gon na do apparently or something like that unless of course they have funding issues postdoc e : great . great . phd c : and then then it ma they may not do phase two but from all the web documentation it looked like , `` oh , this is phase one `` , whatever that means . postdoc e : super . super . great . yeah , that i mean , they 're really well respected in the linguistics d side too and the discourse area , and so this is a very good corpus . phd c : but , it uh it would also maybe help be helpful for liz , if she wanted to start working on some discourse issues , you know , looking at some of this data and then , grad a : right . phd c : you know so when she gets here maybe that might be a good thing for her . grad a : actually , that 's another thing i was thinking about is that maybe jane should talk to liz , to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked . phd c : maybe we should have a big meeting meeting . phd b : sure , of course . undergrad d : that would be a meeting meeting meeting ? grad a : a meeting meeting meeting . phd c : yeah . grad a : well this is the meeting about the meeting meeting meeting . so . phd c : right . but maybe we should , uh find some day that liz uh , liz and andreas seem to be around more often . grad a : mm - hmm . phd c : so maybe we should find a day when they 're gon na be here and and morgan 's gon na be here , and we can meet , at least this subgroup . i mean , not necessarily have the u - dub people down . grad a : well , i was even thinking that maybe we need to at least ping the u - dub to see"
