    "query": "<s> what was included in the transcription formalization ?",
    "answer": "postdoc e : exactly . yeah . thank you . and so , uh , i do a an exhaustive listing of the forms actually , i will go through this in in order , so if if we could maybe wait and stick keep that for a second cuz we 're not ready for that . grad d : so on the fifth page , seven down postdoc e : yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . exactly ! exactly ! alright so , a spelling check first then an exhaustive listing of the , uh all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached and at that point i pick up things like , oh , you know , word followed by two commas . and th and then another check involves , uh , being sure that every utterance has an identifiable speaker . and if not , then that gets checked . then there 's this issue of glossing s w so - called `` spoken - forms `` . so there mo for the most part , we 're keeping it standard wo word level transcription . but there 's w and that that 's done with the assumption that pronunciation variants can be handled . so for things like `` and `` , the fact that someone does n't say the `` d `` , uh that 's not important enough to capture in the transcription because a a good pronunciation , uh , you know , model would be able to handle that . however , things like `` cuz `` where you 're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable , and furthermore , it 's a form that 's specific to spoken language , those are r reasons f for those reasons i i kept that separate , and used the convention of using `` cuz `` for that form , however , glossing it so that it 's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one , and a couple of others , not many . so `` wan na `` is another one , `` going `` uh , `` gon na `` is another one , with just the assumption , again , that this th these are things which it 's not really fair to a c consider expect that a pronunciation model , to handle . and chuck , you in you indicated that `` cuz `` is is one of those that 's handled in a different way also , did n't you ? did i phd b : i do n't remember . postdoc e : ok . so so it might not have been it might not have been you , but someone told me that in fact `` cuz `` is treated differently in , um , i u in this context because of that r reason that , um , it 's a little bit farther than a pronunciation variant . ok , so after that , let 's see , phd b : so that was part of the spell - check , { comment } or was that that was after the spell - check ? postdoc e : um . well so when i get the exhau so the spell - check picks up those words because they 're not in the dictionary . phd b : uh - huh . postdoc e : so it gets `` cuz `` and `` wan na `` and that grad d : and then you gloss them ? postdoc e : yeah , mm - hmm . run it through i have a sed you know , so i do sed script saying whenever you see `` gon na `` you know , `` convert it to gon na `` , you know , `` gloss equals quote going - to quote `` , you know . and with all these things being in curly brackets grad d : mm - hmm . postdoc e : so they 're always distinctive . ok , i also wrote a script which will , um , retrieve anything in curly brackets , or anything which i 've classified as an acronym , and a pronounced acronym . and the way i tag ac pronounced acronyms is that i have underscores between the components . so if it 's `` acl `` then it 's `` a `` underscore `` c `` underscore `` l `` . grad d : and so so your list here , are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings ? postdoc e : and the th yes . uh - huh , yeah . grad d : whew ! postdoc e : ok , so now . uh and a grad d : we are acronym - loaded . phd g : um , can i ask a question about the glossing , uh before we go on ? postdoc e : yeah . phd g : so , for a word like `` because `` is it that it 's always predictably `` because `` ? i mean , is `` cuz `` always meaning `` because `` ? postdoc e : yes , but not the reverse . so sometimes people will say `` because `` in the meeting , and if if they actually said `` because `` , then it 's written as `` because `` with no w `` cuz `` does n't even figure into the equation . professor f : but but in our meetings people do n't say `` hey cuz how you doing ? `` phd g : beca - because right . { comment } right . grad d : except right there . postdoc e : yeah . professor f : yeah . phd g : um , so , i guess so , from the point of view of postdoc e : that 's a good point . phd g : the the only problem is that with for the recognition we we map it to `` because `` , grad d : well , phd g : and so if we know that `` cuz `` postdoc e : that 's fine . grad d : but they have the gloss . postdoc e : well don has a script . grad c : yeah . phd g : but , we do n't grad d : you have the gloss form so you always replace it . postdoc e : exactly . grad d : if that 's how what you wan na do . postdoc e : uh - huh . and don knows this , grad c : yeah . postdoc e : and he 's bee he has a glo he has a script that grad c : i replace the `` cuz `` with `` because `` if it 's glossed . phd g : s right . but , if it 's ok . grad c : and phd g : but then there are other glosses that we do n't replace , right ? because postdoc e : yes . and that 's why there 're different tags on the glosses , phd g : ok . so , then it 's fine . postdoc e : on the different on the different types of comments , which we 'll which we 'll see in just a second . grad c : right . postdoc e : so the pronounceable acronyms get underscores , the things in curly brackets are viewed as comments . there 're comments of four types . so this is a good time to introduce that . the four types . w and maybe we 'll expand that grad d : um postdoc e : but the but the comments are , um , of four types mainly right now . one of them is , um , the gloss type we just mentioned . grad d : can ca postdoc e : another type is , um grad d : so a are we done with acronyms ? cuz i had a question on what what this meant . postdoc e : i 'm still doing the overview . i have n't actually gotten here yet . grad d : oh i 'm sorry . postdoc e : ok so , gloss is things like replacing the full form u with the , um , more abbreviated one to the left . uh , then you have if it 's uh , there 're a couple different types of elements that can happen that are n't really properly words , and wo some of them are laughs and breathes , so we have uh that 's prepended with a v a tag of `` voc `` . phd a : whew ! postdoc e : and the non - vocal ones are like door - slams and tappings , and that 's prepended with a no non - vocalization . phd b : so then it just an ending curly brace there , or is there something else in there . postdoc e : oh yeah , so i e this would grad d : a comment , basically . postdoc e : let 's just take one example . phd b : oh , oh , oh . postdoc e : and then the no non - vocalization would be something like a door - slam . they always end . so it 's like they 're paired curly brackets . and then the third type right now , uh , is m things that fall in the category of comments about what 's happening . so it could be something like , you know , `` referring to so - and - so `` , `` talking about such - and - such `` , uh , you know , `` looking at so - and - so `` . phd b : so on the m postdoc e : yeah . phd b : on the middle t so , in the first case that gloss applies to the word to the left . but in the middle two th - it 's not applying to anything , right ? postdoc e : yeah , and this gets substituted here . grad d : they 're impulsive . postdoc e : huh - uh . no , they 're events . grad d : well the `` qual `` can be the `` qual `` is applying to the left . postdoc e : they 're actually they have the status of events . phd b : right , i just meant the middle two ones , yeah . postdoc e : well , and actually , um , it is true that , with respect to `` laugh `` , there 's another one which is `` while laughing `` , grad d : `` while laughing `` . postdoc e : and that is , uh , i i an argument could be made for this tur turning that into a qualitative statement because it 's talking about the thing that preceded it , but at present we have n't been , um , uh , coding the exact scope of laughing , you know , and so to have `` while laughing `` , you know that it happened somewhere in there which could well mean that it occurred separately and following , or , you know , including some of the utterances to the left . have n't been awfully precise about that , but i have here , now we 're about to get to the to this now , i have frequencies . so you 'll see how often these different things occur . but , um , uh , the very front page deals with this , uh , final c pa uh , uh , aspect of the standardization which has to do with the spoken forms like `` mm - hmm `` and `` mm - hmm `` and `` ha `` and `` uh - uh `` and all these different types . and , um , uh , someone pointed out to me , this might have been chuck , { comment } about , um about how a recognizer , if it 's looking for `` mm - hmmm `` with three m 's , and it 's transcribed with two m 's , that it might uh , that it might increase the error rate which is which would really be a shame because um , i p i personally w would not be able to make a claim that those are dr dramatically different items . so , right now i 've standardized across all the existing data with these spoken forms . grad d : oh good ."
