    "answer": "user interface : having just listened to what corinne just said , i 'll draw on some of the things as well . some things that sort of relevant to what i wan na say . 'kay so i 'm just gon na yeah approach the technical functions design . um the method i used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . marketing : user interface : and t s simplest approach that i came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . i mean that 's an obvious thing to say , but it 's not attached to the device that you want to control . um i had some things sent to me . not very much . to look at similar devices . um defined in some them . and then the personal preferences that i will suggest . um we discussed a universal one . um like it 's just been brought up again then . but i think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you 'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . i 'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to i they 're a nightmare to use . you have to set them , reset them to everything . um and that would only add buttons . whereas i think the aim is to take away buttons . so i think it 'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for tvs . um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that 's unique in design . um okay here here 's just two pictures of remote controls . they 're just simple tv remote controls . but one is uh user-centred . that is the one on the left . and you can straight away see there 's less buttons . and the other one is engineer-centred where that 's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it 's trying to control um which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred . fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what 's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they 're hidden away . and the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . um and finally , um uh sort i 've sort of covered that , our product i think should be user interface orientated . um like i said to concentrate on tv remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . um and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it 's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . and that 's it . industrial designer : cable there . thank you . project manager : what was your last conclusion on that one ? focus on uh the i user interface : on something on the image of it . project manager : the image of it ."
