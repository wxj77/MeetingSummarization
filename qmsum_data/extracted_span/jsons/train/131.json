    "answer": "project manager : good . industrial designer : beep . oh . project manager : so well uh user interface : what ? project manager : welcome everyone . user interface : yeah . project manager : um as you may have noticed i uh user interface : industrial designer : project manager : created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . user interface : yeah . project manager : i do n't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting . marketing : that 's new one ? project manager : yeah . user interface : we did n't make any uh industrial designer : uh , we should save that one . user interface : oh in project manager : then i 'll move this one . user interface : did n't we just do that ? industrial designer : yeah , save in the folder . save as project . project manager : oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . industrial designer : oh , okay . project manager : and we have a evaluation left here . user interface : industrial designer : hmm hmm . project manager : okay . industrial designer : agenda . project manager : well not main documents this time . oh uh yes . i have it open myself i guess . um well the detailed design meeting huh ? we 're finally getting somewhere hopefully . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : um what are we going to do ? i 've opened it already . um i 'm still going to take some minutes , and if i 'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? industrial designer : oh , sorry . marketing : project manager : are n't you ? user interface : we could . project manager : yes , you are . industrial designer : project manager : and uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? marketing : yep . yep . project manager : good . and we have a correct agenda . and uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , user interface : oops . project manager : and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . okay , well finance uh will be later . now i 'd like to give the word to you two . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . user interface : well uh industrial designer : get up stand up . just user interface : we made a prototype . industrial designer : 'kay . user interface : we first start with the overall uh this is about the total remote control . industrial designer : view . user interface : we made it green . industrial designer : just example colour , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so uh there 's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype . user interface : it 's a fresh colour . and uh the screen light blue . oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . and the r_ and r_ logo , it just says r_ and r_ now , but uh industrial designer : okay ? user interface : any questions so far ? marketing : big microphone . industrial designer : yeah , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . marketing : oh okay . that 's the place where it 's going to be , not the size . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh well , it 's an idea in a so . user interface : oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it 's there and uh industrial designer : do not forget it . user interface : uh marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : to function it it does n't really have to be sm uh big of course . marketing : yeah , okay . of course . industrial designer : the microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . marketing : mm . mm , th yeah . industrial designer : okay um marketing : small . industrial designer : we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh i uh um user interface : you push the scroll button industrial designer : yeah , you push the scroll button user interface : and it 's claps out if there 's a industrial designer : and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . for example uh tv settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . user interface : remote settings , et cetera . yeah . industrial designer : so uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see oh , it 's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . um user interface : yeah . and you could also touch it so that it comes out , industrial designer : yeah , that 's c user interface : and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers . industrial designer : yeah . indeed . okay , um it 's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it 's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh yes . in an apart uh user interface : yeah . project manager : so a separate button for for text , industrial designer : in a separate button , yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . user interface : perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah . industrial designer : a sign , yeah , just like okay , indeed . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay , user interface : forgot . industrial designer : we can uh modify that later . okay . would you like to make any comments about next uh user interface : uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the lcd screen . uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . we put ano an an extra button in . we can erase it , but it 's the button where you can switch channels . just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . yeah , that one , yeah . industrial designer : previous page , yeah , indeed . user interface : it has a name . and uh uh we put that in , industrial designer : oh my god . user interface : i thought it would be handy there . uh this the one number or two numbers button . below that , the page and the sound . and uh in the middle the the mute . uh battery indicator . industrial designer : it 's quite large . user interface : it 's it 's a bit big . marketing : user interface : and this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop . or at least it should look like it . and the options uh of teletext . industrial designer : okay . you can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu is n't uh taking uh much uh uh it 's taking much part of the screen , so it 's very uh when you uh when you use it , does n't uh become irritating to see . 'cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . 'cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so user interface : yeah . well this about it , i think . industrial designer : okay . huh . user interface : yeah . project manager : thank you . looks good . user interface : i will put it back on the on the nice green . industrial designer : project manager : and i just missed when i was typing the r_r_ stands for ? user interface : that 's the logo of the project manager : logo , okay . user interface : yeah . it 's th th right now it 's only r_ r_ , but uh marketing : project manager : okay well industrial designer : full screen . project manager : i would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course . marketing : shit . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : alright . user interface : sorry . marketing : 'kay . project manager : okay , the evaluation criteria , user interface : oh full screen , yeah . marketing : evaluation . 'kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . my name , my job , okay . industrial designer : my name , my job . user interface : marketing : the methods . questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , user interface : right . marketing : like question , is remote big enough , we can say it 's true or it 's false by steps . one means absolutely not true , seven means true . user interface : yeah . marketing : the three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are , industrial designer : sorry , user interface : industrial designer : you used the powerpoint marketing : is the remote control fancy enough , user interface : yeah . marketing : is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use . and then evaluation itself . uh . user interface : industrial designer : what ? bling . marketing : okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : first question . is the design fancy enough ? user interface : well marketing : project manager , what do you think ? project manager : well it 's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . and the the curves which we decided , user interface : yeah . marketing : but does it yeah . project manager : only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? user interface : it uh oh it 's in the background . oh . industrial designer : now uh the single curved idea was uh yeah , okay , you ge um user interface : y you should make uh a sideways uh view . industrial designer : yeah . the sideways view , uh that that that ma user interface : it will be , i guess . oh , we can industrial designer : ho not that pen . not that pen . marketing : project manager : well user interface : g i would smart board . project manager : it might work one time , huh . industrial designer : suppose so . user interface : uh can i draw here or uh marketing : think . industrial designer : ah . oh my god , marketing : yeah , yeah , you can . user interface : so it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , industrial designer : it works . user interface : right ? industrial designer : yeah , that 's the single curve indeed . user interface : yeah . so if you v flip it like this . project manager : okay . user interface : here 's yeah . industrial designer : that 's not very i it 's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there , user interface : yeah . so you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , industrial designer : so uh user interface : so that it lays a bit o industrial designer : yeah . marketing : is n't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? user interface : yeah , that 's a bit of problem maybe . marketing : with two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you 're holding it quite a lot i think user interface : yeah . i think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it 's just nothing , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so if you could marketing : yeah . industrial designer : okay , indeed . yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay , but we have to rate uh these things now ? user interface : 'cause otherwise i think i marketing : yeah , we have to rate . project manager : okay . marketing : is it fancy enough ? true is one , false is seven . so fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . user interface : i think it does . industrial designer : i think so . user interface : i if you do n't make it green , then the elder people wo n't wo n't like it . industrial designer : it 's pretty fancy . marketing : i think yeah , i have to agree , all the colour colours don don does n't matter that m that much now , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you get th project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : it 's only design . user interface : i think it does . project manager : yeah . marketing : and the design . project manager : well i think uh especially because of the microphone and the lcd screen also . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . i do n't know whether older people will use it , but project manager : very new thing . well fancy the old people will . marketing : so user interface : i would make it a two or something . marketing : a two ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : it 's true , it 's a one . very fancy . user interface : huh ? alright , it 's a one . oh it 's a one . project manager : no , it 's a two . little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , i n used i wouldn i should use that one , but it does n't industrial designer : user interface : but it 's a one uh maybe uh marketing : okay , no it 's two ? true is a one . user interface : yeah . marketing : very true , is it very true or is n't that true ? project manager : well i 'd say two on a scale user interface : well they think it 's very true , but uh industrial designer : it 's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , marketing : yeah , i think two . user interface : yeah , industrial designer : so user interface : but industrial designer : it 's very fancy , i think . user interface : we should perhaps industrial designer : have you ever seen a remote control like this ? project manager : no , okay well , that 's true . industrial designer : no , okay , user interface : that not . industrial designer : so so it 's fancy . marketing : that 's fancy enough . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay , one two . marketing : then ? project manager : that does n't matter that much , so make it a one . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . let 's give it a two . is it innovative ? user interface : i think it is , marketing : enough . user interface : because it has an lcd screen , a mi microphone . industrial designer : and uh uh the scroll is rubber , user interface : it 's from rubber . marketing : we have for the search function . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so s eno enough to i think . marketing : the scroller a bit i think it 's it 's a one yeah . user interface : it 's a one i think . marketing : true . also huh uh-huh the buttons , are they easy to find ? that was a big requirement of the old people . industrial designer : user interface : yeah , because they 're right on your screen . so you can use the b the the arrows . they 're right on your screen , so i do n't know where you 'd search . industrial designer : with the ones marketing : are all the buttons easy to find ? not only this buttons , all the buttons . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : well , i think they are . the options are it uh little bit harder , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but if you touch the options then it 's uh industrial designer : take a harder look , yeah , sure . marketing : i think th it 's industrial designer : it 's easier than the regular uh remote control . marketing : easy t project manager : yeah , and you use these buttons the most , marketing : yeah , i think this is easy now . i think th i think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to project manager : huh ? so industrial designer : yeah . user interface : no they 're not , but they 're they 're they are easy to find . marketing : to handle . true . industrial designer : yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls marketing : i would rate it a industrial designer : where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button . marketing : yeah , okay , that 's true , that 's true . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most project manager : which marketing : but that 's that 's vantage of lcd screen , you can have text . project manager : so which number are we going to fill in ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i would say yeah . industrial designer : i think it 's uh it 's a two , at least . user interface : yeah . yeah , project manager : a two , yeah ? user interface : you can make it a two . project manager : two , three and industrial designer : it 's not perfect , but marketing : yeah . project manager : what do you think ? marketing : i think it 's a three . industrial designer : a three ? project manager : okay , so we have two , two , three . industrial designer : and why is that ? marketing : i personally think , because i d i do n't think i maybe it 's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . i i think if you have the button at the right , i do n't think you can find the option button that easy . user interface : yeah , but you do n't have t have to use the button on the right . you can touch it . marketing : you can touch it . user interface : yeah . you you can touch options . industrial designer : it said bo both the options . marketing : yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , user interface : yeah . marketing : right ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay , then okay , good . then i think also two , yeah . user interface : you can touch options project manager : a two , okay , user interface : and it 's comes out . project manager : because we have to industrial designer : a two , a two . user interface : the uh the um below . project manager : it 's the box below it , industrial designer : uh the next question the next question . oh my god . marketing : user interface : project manager : otherwise we have two results in one question . user interface : it 's different . industrial designer : project manager : okay , next question . marketing : it 's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people . user interface : for young people i think it 's easy to use . marketing : young means sixteen to forty years . industrial designer : yeah , i was uh user interface : yeah . marketing : and elderly from forty eight to their death . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i think it 's industrial designer : i think it 's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . user interface : in the entire mankind . project manager : okay , you 're very enthusiastic about your own design , marketing : also if you 're sixty years old industrial designer : yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh you do n't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so it 's t i think it 's really easy to use . you want these options to project manager : as well for the for the older people ? industrial designer : uh sure . marketing : yeah , as well as your if you 're fif sixty years old , you 're holding one of those things in your hand user interface : yeah , but uh yeah , but they they do n't want the uh extra options , right ? marketing : no , but we 're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , user interface : so project manager : and would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? user interface : yeah , okay , marketing : so it it it has to be user interface : but so they could uh i think it is . if they read a manual . project manager : because that might marketing : if you read the manual , user interface : yeah , alright . industrial designer : perhaps that is one of the most uh marketing : always . project manager : m maybe that 's the most user friendly and easy to use . user interface : because it it 's not it 's not it 's it 's not uh difficult . industrial designer : uh because a lot of user interface : you say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , industrial designer : channel one , channel four , yeah . user interface : then you say the question and the answer . and that 's everything it does , the speech recognition . industrial designer : project manager : yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . user interface : yeah . i think it would make it uh industrial designer : yeah , i think it does . marketing : so industrial designer : because all the people who ca n't uh user interface : i would make it two . marketing : also two ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh a two . sure , two . marketing : not a seven for this ? user interface : three ? project manager : i 'd say three . marketing : i would also say three . industrial designer : project manager : okay , so we have three three two two user interface : oh . you ? project manager : or so what are we going to do ? user interface : well two and a half . project manager : okay , a three , i see . uh user interface : three ? no . industrial designer : give me more . marketing : project manager : another question . marketing : remotes overwhelmed with buttons . no , that that 's that 's user interface : but um i mean , marketing : yeah . user interface : that 's definitely one . marketing : tha that 's a one , i think , that 's definitely a one . industrial designer : that 's definitely our uh user interface : oh nee , oh seven is it ? it is . yeah , uh marketing : oh yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah , user interface : the remote score . industrial designer : a false , yeah . project manager : but i think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , marketing : yeah , i think is n't , this has to be something like is n't overwhelmed . project manager : because otherwise we ca n't uh calculate anything from the results , user interface : it 's not overwhelmed . yeah . project manager : so industrial designer : yeah , indeed . marketing : true . project manager : okay , a one , because we designed for that , huh ? marketing : remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups . industrial designer : user interface : 'cause we make them in different colours , project manager : yeah . user interface : so that they uh industrial designer : yeah , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : is optional . project manager : yeah , and i though w we had about single colours , marketing : that 's true . project manager : but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , user interface : yeah . that it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah . project manager : ca n't you ? marketing : also with rubber ? user interface : uh i think you can . project manager : whether it looks like wood , it is n't w it is n't wood marketing : yeah , okay . project manager : but user interface : it it feels like rubber , project manager : you can make a print on rubber , user interface : but project manager : ca n't you ? yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so that 's a one then , user interface : well but then when you scratch it it does come off . marketing : yeah ? project manager : huh ? marketing : that 's a one ? user interface : so that 's a bit industrial designer : yeah , it is it is harder to marketing : okay . project manager : do you have many questions ? marketing : uh i have industrial designer : to like project manager : oh , okay well marketing : user interface : oh we have time . industrial designer : geez . project manager : yeah , but we have we also we have to get to the money . industrial designer : we 're getting paid . we 're getting paid . marketing : the material used is spongy , user interface : what ? marketing : that that 's uh that 's a one , that 's m rubber . project manager : what spongy . user interface : yeah , yeah , it 's very spongy . marketing : yeah , i th think it 's not the most spongy thing . user interface : but not it 's not very spongy , because it 's hard rubber . i think it 's a three . industrial designer : yeah , it 's a three , project manager : uh-huh , yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , user interface : hard but yeah . you can break it . industrial designer : because it has a lcd screen . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : hard to lose , marketing : remote control is hard to lose . industrial designer : yeah it sh and it 's easy to find . user interface : y yeah , you could you could call it . marketing : y you ca n't you ca n't lose it if you 're sixty years old . if first time see the thing you didn did n't adjust uh set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . user interface : yeah , y you can lose it , but it is n't hard to lose . marketing : it is n't hard , no . i think i think this is a two , personally . user interface : two . that it 's hard to lose ? yeah , it it is there 's the project manager : yeah , industrial designer : is n't hard to lose . project manager : so is n't hard to lose you . user interface : it 's a six , you think ? industrial designer : is n't hard to lose , yeah . marketing : is n't hard to lose . user interface : so it 's a two . yeah , you can lose it , so i do n't marketing : yeah . you ca n't lose it . user interface : you can make it a three i it does have an a built in function . marketing : or if you 're you 're sixty years old , your demands project manager : yeah , but a har a hard to lose is good . so it should this question should be hard to lose . it 's difficult to lose it . user interface : nee . hard to lose . oh right . industrial designer : yeah , this this is hard to lose . project manager : user interface : it is hard to lose . yeah , so then this is it is almost true , industrial designer : this project manager : a two . marketing : i think yeah , i think also . user interface : so a two . project manager : a two . industrial designer : two , yeah . project manager : okay . user interface : industrial designer : and most all because of the option to whoa . user interface : ooh . project manager : yeah , it 's okay . that happens above also . but maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal , marketing : yeah ? oh , okay . project manager : but yep . oh , it is n't , user interface : oh well , project manager : well okay . user interface : it does n't . industrial designer : put the cor cursor on the . project manager : remember . marketing : okay okay okay . industrial designer : click . marketing : remote control mainly be sold to younger people . user interface : i think it will , industrial designer : true . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : true . marketing : yeah ? true ? very true ? user interface : uh well industrial designer : uh yeah . uh project manager : there . user interface : i a marketing : no , i do n't think very true because the colours . user interface : a two . marketing : we have the colours . um we have the buttons is are n't that that much . industrial designer : materials , yeah . marketing : nah , the material is n't that user interface : it 's it 's much more younger . industrial designer : uh okay . so ma uh make it make it a two . marketing : so i don i think i think it 's a three . project manager : well i think it 's it 's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , project manager : did n't we ? user interface : i think it 's a two marketing : but i uh user interface : but marketing : okay , okay . project manager : what do you think ? marketing : i think because project manager : questions ? industrial designer : a two ? i think it 's two . i think it 's two too , two too too . project manager : two . uh-huh . marketing : yeah ? user interface : two two two . let 's make everything a two . marketing : in the features ? project manager : dissatisfy younger people . um user interface : younger people . it has industrial designer : well perhaps not . user interface : what did marketing : because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . user interface : yeah . well that it does n't . industrial designer : well , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , user interface : yeah bu but industrial designer : but it 's for a remote control i think it i it would satisfy those needs . user interface : i think they like the speech . you could call to your uh industrial designer : yeah , the speech possibility , user interface : yeah , and the screen , industrial designer : the colours . marketing : lcd screen and scroll . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : scroll options , yeah . marketing : i i think they 'll be quite met with their expectations . project manager : yeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something . user interface : right , that that that project manager : it has relatively few features , user interface : those are features . marketing : it 's three features , basically , project manager : with marketing : the lcd touch screen is feature . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : the microphone is a feature . user interface : are n't the features the microphone 's feature and that you can change the channel 's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , project manager : yeah . user interface : and that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . yeah . project manager : ours had other features with marketing : yeah , okay . i think yeah , and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings . industrial designer : the easy volume up button . user interface : those are features . industrial designer : remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . turn uh turn up the volume . marketing : yeah yeah . user interface : enough features ? marketing : so i 've chos i shou i think it 's it 's it 's a one . personally , yeah . i think once you 've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you 'd like , microphone extra , lcd screen extra , scroll thing extra . project manager : okay , you think one , user interface : yeah . project manager : what do you think ? user interface : i think two or three . project manager : you . three , yeah . i 'd say three , so two it is then user interface : yeah . yeah uh a two a two . just another two . marketing : make it make it a two . project manager : or industrial designer : one two three . marketing : or make it uh a fucking two . user interface : we like two . industrial designer : right . marketing : you can see the remote control is r_ and r_ . user interface : yeah , there 's r_ and r_ in front . project manager : yeah . marketing : has user interface : uh it 's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has r_ and r_ . marketing : oh yeah , do did have nah y you have the black one . user interface : yeah . marketing : and we 'll probably make also a yellow one . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , project manager : yeah , user interface : but not r_ and r_ yellow i think . project manager : maybe maybe two . well m th but the logo is on on the front , industrial designer : okay , true , yeah . marketing : maybe two . project manager : so a two , yeah , user interface : one d on i it 's the colours and the marketing : x_ marks spot . project manager : that 's marketing : and the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . user interface : i think it is , but i do n't know what you think . industrial designer : i think it 's easier to use than a regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . entirely explained . marketing : yeah , tha that 's so true . mm-hmm . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah , uh user interface : and you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal tv uh remote . industrial designer : yeah , you can navigate . uh . marketing : i think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . industrial designer : you 're not satisfied , okay . let 's start over again then . marketing : no , i 'm not not convinc . user interface : yeah . let 's make a different remote . well industrial designer : marketing : let 's go th for inhalation of air ] user interface : menu . industrial designer : marketing : i think it would be a t yeah , two . user interface : a two ? industrial designer : a two . marketing : now lower . project manager : oh , well that 's that 's pretty good , user interface : we only have twos . industrial designer : oh yeah , i think so . yeah . user interface : uh just twos . one three and a few ones . industrial designer : and three . marketing : so okay , we have one three , a one , that that have to got up . user interface : two threes . marketing : two two two two two . user interface : we m mostly have twos , so it 's pretty good . marketing : so two , yeah . the average is a two . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : the average . marketing : that is quite good user interface : yeah . i think so too . industrial designer : yeah , i think so . marketing : in my opinion . that user interface : we can be happy . industrial designer : save . user interface : yeah . what is it ? it 's like a bug or something . industrial designer : it 's a fly . user interface : a fly , yeah . a f butterfly . yeah . that 's it . marketing : okay . project manager : that was your evaluation uh show , okay , so we do n't have to calculate anything because of um these results . user interface : sure . marketing : no , it 's two . the average is two . project manager : okay , good . user interface : it 's good . yeah . project manager : um let 's see oh , it is n't asked to save but it did already industrial designer : yeah . exactly . marketing : yeah , i uh uh i uh saved it . project manager : and this everything okay . well , the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group , but i am willing to try it . marketing : project manager : because we are going to look at the finance and i have a nice excel sheet to do that . user interface : yeah . marketing : user interface : redesign . no . project manager : and um i 'm not sure if i put it in the project folder . industrial designer : project manager : look on that . um and we 're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are uh under or at twelve euro fifty , user interface : yeah . project manager : we 're good , and if they 're not we 're going to uh re-design , user interface : yeah . project manager : but we have to do that uh very very quick i think , user interface : so we 're going to erase features or something . project manager : yes . um i do n't know if i user interface : do you have the cost project manager : put the excel sheet in the user interface : or uh let 's hope . project manager : n not in the industrial designer : marketing : f fifty five euros . project manager : folder . i think it 's user interface : we 're going to be here at eight o'clock . project manager : i think it 's still in my own documents folder . industrial designer : user interface : we 're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock . industrial designer : project manager : oh shit . user interface : i doubt it . perhaps we 've got features that do n't exist in the excel sheet . marketing : yeah mm yeah , maybe . project manager : so user interface : no , marketing : the microphone . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : it was in my uh my information , so uh industrial designer : it i it was n't too much . marketing : yeah ? user interface : yeah . marketing : maybe you 're going scrap scrap it . industrial designer : as well as the lcd screen . whoa . project manager : okay , well this is it . user interface : well , if it does n't work project manager : um maybe i could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that i can also uh take minutes , user interface : i want to fill it in , but uh project manager : and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions . marketing : no prob . ah . user interface : but you should uh direct marketing : count it ? li like write it be project manager : well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things . but you have to fill in this column , huh ? industrial designer : count it . you got excel to count . user interface : the number of project manager : no , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay industrial designer : oh okay . project manager : and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens , industrial designer : well i dra marketing : ah , okay , cool . industrial designer : uh danny , danny , i 'll do that , marketing : huh ? yeah ? oh , yea yeah , you design it . um industrial designer : because i draw the uh project manager : so user interface : we 've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , but it 's it 's more about the energy source , huh ? do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? user interface : yeah . i would do a battery we do . right ? marketing : solar cell . no project manager : we 'll wait . user interface : a battery . one battery , industrial designer : no , no solar cell , no no no no . marketing : it took a battery ? user interface : right ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : no hand dynamo . marketing : yeah . user interface : electronics , simple chip industrial designer : hand marketing : we have user interface : advanced chip , right ? marketing : no , we have sample speaker . industrial designer : on advanced chip . marketing : but b al but we also have sample speaker , do user interface : yeah , industrial designer : yeah , yeah . user interface : so this one and this one . uh we ha we have um single marketing : oh , we already on nine . user interface : what ? are we ? oh yay . marketing : we have double curved . user interface : the single . industrial designer : single nee single curved . double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . marketing : single . industrial designer : but it is n't three dimensional , user interface : oh the the industrial designer : it is n't curved in a l marketing : this one is user interface : it 's not going to work uh people . we have rubber . marketing : this one is curved like this , project manager : i 'll just fill it in . marketing : right . it 's curved like this . industrial designer : no no no , project manager : um rubber indeed ? industrial designer : single curved is like this . uh that 's the only curve you made , marketing : yeah , bu what industrial designer : not th uh curved like that . that 's uh marketing : oh , but we have curves like it and it . user interface : thirteen ? marketing : there are two curves , right ? oh , okay i understand , i understand . user interface : with a scroll wheel , right ? is he integrated ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : rubber . user interface : no , eh ? i do n't know . industrial designer : yeah , marketing : push button . no , we do n't have push button . industrial designer : we got ta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it wo n't just pu uh makes possible to s user interface : oh yeah , right , we want it to it 's not it 's not no . industrial designer : not going to work ? marketing : lcd display . industrial designer : okay . okay um user interface : fifteen , oh , too bad . oh but with special colour we have . a special form , right ? industrial designer : but now button supplements . we do n't got the button supplements . user interface : oh , we do n't have any buttons , so marketing : eighteen and a half , user interface : yeah , we need to uh marketing : damn . industrial designer : damn . marketing : we have to lower it with six points . user interface : no , uh we have fifteen and industrial designer : okay . marketing : twelve and half . user interface : oh , right . industrial designer : user interface : we could lose the curve . marketing : we could use user interface : yeah , i would lose the curve . industrial designer : we could lose the scroll wheel . you could make it just a regular scroll wheel . user interface : but you ca n't push it , so you have to tap . industrial designer : yeah , if you ca n't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button . user interface : yeah , alright . project manager : yeah , i think that will be our best bet . user interface : so normal scroll wheel ? industrial designer : normal scroll wheel . user interface : and i think we should lose the curve . marketing : i think we should scrap the sample speaker . industrial designer : lose marketing : it 's four pri it four units . user interface : yeah , but if you would i it is a new feature , it it 's something special . industrial designer : okay , so we do n't exactly need the single we do n't need a curve . marketing : but w d wha user interface : no , the curve does n't really industrial designer : 's possible to lose curve . marketing : curved then it will be square . user interface : no , then it will wo n't uh stand up from the table . then it would just industrial designer : okay . marketing : was that does that mean to it , single curve ? industrial designer : yeah , that 's meant with scr uh with s curve . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : the curve is uh in a dimension . marketing : okay . industrial designer : if you make it a flat one , s n it 's no curve , you got no curves . user interface : so we would lose this one ? industrial designer : yeah , okay . marketing : yeah , but tha that that only is one . user interface : yeah , we could s yeah , a bit . industrial designer : no , two . marketing : no , one . user interface : sixteen point three . industrial designer : oh , okay , indeed . marketing : so we do n't user interface : so we still marketing : yeah , we also have to industrial designer : is it possible to make user interface : could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? marketing : no , otherwise we do n't have an lcd screen . user interface : no ? ma y you just ca n't do that , or uh project manager : and what did you change ? you changed the uh scroll wheel user interface : we changed th project manager : and user interface : yeah , and the single curved to uncurved . marketing : single curved . project manager : oh , but it 's just one marketing : flat . yeah , so that does does n't does n't that mu i think project manager : point , so maybe you should should uh marketing : scrap sample speaker ? project manager : yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition . industrial designer : the sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . marketing : that that 's uh user interface : yeah , but it 's t marketing : yes , four points . project manager : and then you can keep the curve . user interface : yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , project manager : or ca n't you ? user interface : it is something special . industrial designer : yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the marketing : yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? user interface : i do n't know . industrial designer : marketing : f you have to we have to scrap four points . user interface : yeah , that 's difficult . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : or make it on a hand dynamo , but i do n't think that will work . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? industrial designer : no , that 's no . make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ? user interface : we could make it titanium instead of rubber . industrial designer : you do n't make a remote control of ah . marketing : yeah , project manager : yeah , marketing : it it i project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah , it also uh it also takes one point less . project manager : yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , user interface : oh . oh can i ask something ? what is special colour ? marketing : yeah . user interface : is that the wood uh wood uh marketing : i think it is . user interface : this , we have to have that one too ? industrial designer : it is n't . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : what ? marketing : yeah . project manager : but it 's only a half . but i think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . marketing : yeah . sample speaker . industrial designer : to knock the sample speaker , yeah . and sample sensor . user interface : th then we still have too much marketing : yeah , okay , user interface : if we use the uh industrial designer : but m yeah , course , marketing : three . point three . industrial designer : but user interface : yeah , we we scrap that one ? industrial designer : what we 'll have . let 's make it thirteen or fourteen . user interface : see , a po marketing : point twelve . user interface : three . we need point three . marketing : that 's a scroll wheel . user interface : uh it 's a colour . do n't make it wood . industrial designer : a colour . marketing : yeah , but a wood user interface : make it uh marketing : we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . user interface : yeah , but it 's it 's special colour , is it a all kind of colours ? industrial designer : yeah , special colours , fruity colours . user interface : it 's also green or uh marketing : is it also industrial designer : yeah . marketing : no that that 's just normal colour fruit colours . user interface : yeah , but it 's a special colour than just rubber colour . marketing : normal colours , yellow user interface : you have to add something to the rubber to make it green . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : you do n't say here 's green rubber . industrial designer : they do n't sell green rubber plants . marketing : yeah , but then i d i do n't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . industrial designer : alright . user interface : yeah , you can , you should you have to lose marketing : but then we have to scrap lcd display , we have to scrap uh user interface : no , it is the scroll wheel , i guess . industrial designer : no no no . marketing : s advanced chip . no then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gon na make ? industrial designer : if we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen marketing : five ? then we have two . user interface : a push , yeah . marketing : touch . industrial designer : then it 's possible to make . and then you can and then you can add to the colours . marketing : then we can make add two colours on it . yeah , two colours it . industrial designer : special c user interface : switch colours . industrial designer : okay , if you lose uh if you lose the user interface : it was such a great idea . industrial designer : you lose this one , you got eleven point five marketing : they can add two colours . industrial designer : and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example . marketing : but the colours . um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or industrial designer : how d uh uh how many colours ? user interface : what do you mean ? industrial designer : special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p marketing : yeah , but we we we are we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . industrial designer : yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it 's a special colour . marketing : ah okay . user interface : but i think when you use the colour that 's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , industrial designer : i suppose . user interface : 'cause you have to add it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . user interface : yeah , so you always lose the special colour . you co you could make it always black , like normal remote . marketing : yeah b yeah , but we 're gon na make it yellow uh red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . industrial designer : nee we we also want to make ano another colour . user interface : oh right , yeah . yeah , we should u marketing : yeah , but m user interface : yeah . we have to make this like four or five or something . marketing : yeah , user interface : that 's what it means . marketing : because we have more colours than only black . project manager : yeah , but is n't it per remote that you pay ? user interface : yeah . marketing : i then i think i p i don i do n't think they me mean they 're special project manager : half ? user interface : oh right , yeah . is it per remote ? project manager : i think you pay half per remote . user interface : yeah . yeah , that 's right , project manager : so each remote with a special colour . user interface : and you one colour per remote . industrial designer : yeah , indeed , yeah . user interface : so then it is one . industrial designer : you do n't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote . marketing : yeah , okay okay , true . true , true . project manager : i hope . marketing : we have two points spare . project manager : so the battery , marketing : nee one point . project manager : we have um advanced chip on print . user interface : one . so it would be curved , single curve . industrial designer : project manager : because of thing user interface : or not ? project manager : yeah , well you can at least make it curved again . user interface : so y you just ca n't make a nice remote . industrial designer : yeah , single curve . project manager : because that was very important , user interface : it 's too bad for the speaker . project manager : huh ? so it 's curved , it 's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . user interface : should we change that tha that that 's a one if not , marketing : mm yep . project manager : we dropped the scroll wheel . user interface : or not ? could you copy it ? project manager : and the rest is the same , user interface : and make it uh project manager : huh ? am i right ? marketing : y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . user interface : the entire uh industrial designer : uh . huh . user interface : perhaps you can then copy page or so . ooh . no . oh you you made the entire could you industrial designer : okay . undo , undo . user interface : oh industrial designer : undo . user interface : not well . industrial designer : so , 'kay . user interface : would you ? industrial designer : twenty minutes ? user interface : by the perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . add it copy page . select all . project manager : no , but you c yeah . user interface : alright , something went wrong . project manager : okay , but this this new remote we can afford . user interface : it does n't work . let 's forget . marketing : it should 've work . industrial designer : okay , so you had this list at start ? project manager : hmm ? no , i had n't . industrial designer : alright . when did you receive this list ? project manager : i just received it . industrial designer : ah okay . user interface : yeah . oh project manager : they do n't work so hard at the finance department . user interface : ignore that . well , so industrial designer : ah okay . i suppose this is a user interface : too bad . industrial designer : okay , so we lose the scroll wheel , user interface : yeah . the microphone . project manager : yeah , and that 's it . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and the microphone . user interface : a and we changed something , i guess , or not ? we oh no . industrial designer : okay . project manager : twelve euro fifty . um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ? user interface : yeah , i tried to copy that one , but it did n't work . project manager : it did n't work . user interface : so we could fix it like tha that it 's like this . project manager : hmm . strange . user interface : you could select it all , but then you ca n't erase . industrial designer : strange . project manager : oh , you can arrange industrial designer : you can only re erase ? user interface : erase . when you saw th li uh earlier when we selected it , w i could n't erase anything . industrial designer : uh , no . project manager : hmm , ca n't you then just say copy ? industrial designer : bling . project manager : new page . paste . yes . select none . user interface : just tap somewhere . industrial designer : just up somewhere b uh besides it , marketing : just tap somewhere . industrial designer : right . project manager : okay , user interface : yeah . project manager : and now you can erase . user interface : i do n't think i can , but uh we can try . industrial designer : uh , we already try . project manager : well it should be possible . user interface : oh , yeah , project manager : oh no . user interface : no , ha-ha . project manager : well you can draw over it with white uh pen . user interface : yeah , we tried it earlier . it 's very much work . project manager : yeah . sorry . user interface : project manager : well but that 's also useful for the evaluation , because i think uh we have a prototype now marketing : evaluation drops . project manager : which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh design . doodle . and i think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . marketing : and erase the mic . user interface : yeah , goodbye mic . industrial designer : all i need is no mic . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : project manager : let 's see , we can save this now . user interface : oh , i already erased half of the line . industrial designer : bon chance project manager : and move back to here . user interface : too bad , oh . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : user interface : like this ? project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : still looks nice . project manager : and then all green . okay , well thank you . user interface : oh , that 's erase . marketing : looks like a ipod . project manager : oh , no . hey , but you can erase that . industrial designer : add user interface : yeah , that 's a bit weird . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh-oh . user interface : oh , now i 'm line . industrial designer : s difference between lines and text and the pen . user interface : yeah . project manager : right . marketing : oh . all i need is mic . project manager : and you ca n't erase this ? marketing : project manager : hmm , strange . okay , well uh user interface : it 's weird . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : just leave it at this and quickly save . marketing : station page . project manager : um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . industrial designer : huh , looks fucking boring now . project manager : we just did our project evaluation . um well , i think i can sit for that since it 's almost my final slide . um what did you think about uh the process ? how satisfied are we ? industrial designer : deadlines were sometimes very short . user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : bu but stressful . you think , no , my presentation is n't ready . industrial designer : but project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and stressful . marketing : i think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : now we worked through each other , project manager : and you could ask things . user interface : yeah , you had information i did n't have marketing : something he said user interface : and then uh marketing : yeah , and you had information i also had , user interface : oh right . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so some some things i had in my presentation , they already told , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ? user interface : yeah . marketing : so project manager : and uh user interface : yeah . marketing : so yeah , that i do n't think that is the best way to work at for such project . project manager : yeah . so you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate . industrial designer : yeah , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but but why not work here together , for example ? user interface : yeah , you could industrial designer : why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . well , probably to simulate the whole working uh process , user interface : i think so too . yeah , but then you can work together too industrial designer : yeah . project manager : huh , th you ca n't have a meeting uh for several weeks . user interface : when marketing : yeah m yeah , like she told . then you can work together too by mail or by , i dunno , chat , something , user interface : a chat would also be uh industrial designer : huh , oh right . marketing : but now we 're completely separated from each other . i do n't think that was the best way , but industrial designer : but the technology was uh fantastic . user interface : well , marketing : yeah , the technology 's okay . user interface : i i do n't really like the board , it does n't really work great . sometimes i think . industrial designer : work now ? marketing : yeah okay , but i don i do i think becau that 's because industrial designer : perhaps it is e user interface : it does work , but sometimes it does n't erase or it does n't uh industrial designer : yeah , perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so you can draw uh see it over th on the screen . marketing : yeah , like the f like a plotters or something , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . yep yep yep yep yep . project manager : so you do n't think the smartboard is is really useful user interface : but project manager : or industrial designer : it 's useful , but not m user interface : it is useful , marketing : yeah , it is useful , but user interface : but it does n't really work all the time . th the pen does n't industrial designer : because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below . user interface : the line is a bit off . project manager : yeah , so it 's maybe a bit unnatural also . user interface : yeah , industrial designer : alright . user interface : you can point to where you want the line to be . but industrial designer : the project uh because of the deadlines you did n't had the time to uh have , you did n't have time to uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so you used uh this uh the different powerpoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the oh . user interface : project manager : that was n't me . uh so um user interface : yeah . industrial designer : was n't me . project manager : the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about uh this digital pen ? user interface : i i i used it , marketing : i did n't use it at all . user interface : it it was you can use it , it 's quite handy i think . project manager : yeah , well industrial designer : but i did n't i uh project manager : i use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , user interface : yeah , i used it to y to yeah , it did work pretty well . industrial designer : i used it too , but oh well . user interface : i do n't think why you would want to use it actually , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i did n't use . industrial designer : yeah , user interface : but it it does work . industrial designer : because it shou marketing : no yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : to make some designs , marketing : it is it is industrial designer : it is very easy . marketing : yeah , it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , and then you can show it to everybody . industrial designer : but to write it th yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : it does n't really write normally . marketing : yeah . it 's b bi little bit too big to write . user interface : it 's a bit industrial designer : yeah , it 's too big , it 's too fat . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : fat document , those . industrial designer : project manager : okay , um and what about the teamwork ? user interface : i think it was great , marketing : team work was okay . project manager : yeah , well i think so too . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : we marketing : only thing that we worked through , past each other . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : right . project manager : but that was it was our assignment , marketing : with some things that was only problem , user interface : yeah , but it was because we did n't uh marketing : but user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah yeah yeah , project manager : okay , marketing : but furthermore better . project manager : and maybe i should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership . user interface : marketing : that 's user interface : i thought it was good , but uh yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , no prob . ah . project manager : yeah well , okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : not too much , not too too too too . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : and creativity ? well , when we look at this i 'd say we have been creative , user interface : industrial designer : project manager : huh ? but user interface : well . industrial designer : yeah , or the room for project manager : there was room for industrial designer : it was the idea to be creative , so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and you get get stuff from the from the computer , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but industrial designer : the information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late marketing : little bit uh lo yeah . too late user interface : yeah . industrial designer : or marketing : it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema user interface : you just sit there for ten minutes . yeah , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : where is that email ?
