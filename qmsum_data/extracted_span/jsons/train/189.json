    "answer": "grad b : i thought two things uh we 'll introduce ourselves and what we do . and um we already talked with andreas , thilo and david and some lines of code were already written today and almost tested and just gon na say we have um again the recognizer to parser thing where we 're working on and that should be no problem and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we get enter the tourism domain . em we have talked this morning with the with tilman about the generator . and um there one of our diligent workers has to sort of volunteer to look over tilman 's shoulder while he is changing the grammars to english phd a : mm - hmm . grad b : because w we have we face two ways . either we do a syllable concatenating um grammar for the english generation which is sort of starting from scratch and doing it the easy way , or we simply adopt the ah um more in - depth um style that is implemented in the german system and um are then able not only to produce strings but also the syntactic parse uh not parse not the syntactic tree that is underneath in the syntactic structure which is the way we decided we were gon na go because a , it 's easier in the beginning phd a : mm - hmm . grad b : and um it does require some some knowledge of of those grammars and and and some ling linguistic background . but um it should n't be a problem for anyone . professor f : ok so that sounds good . johno , are you gon na have some time t to do that uh w with these guys ? grad e : sure . professor f : cuz y you 're the grammar maven . i mean it makes sense , grad e : yeah . professor f : does n't it ? yeah good . ok . so , i think that 's probably the the right way to do that . and an yeah , so i i actually wan na f to find out about it too , but i may not have time to get in . grad b : the the ultimate goal is that before they leave we we can run through the entire system input through output on at least one or two sample things . and um and by virtue of doing that then in this case johno will have acquired the knowledge of how to extend it . ad infinitum . when needed , if needed , when wanted and so forth . professor f : ok that sounds great . grad b : and um also um ralf has hooked up with david and you 're gon na continue either all through tonight or tomorrow on whatever to get the er parser interface working . they are thinning out and thickening out lattices and doing this kind of stuff to see what works best . grad d : mmm , yep . professor f : great . so , you guys enjoy your weekend ? phd a : yes , very much so . grad d : yeah , very much professor f : ok , before before you got put to work ? great . ok , so that 's sort of one branch is to get us caught up on what 's going on . also of course it would be really nice to know what the plans are , in addition to what 's sort of already in code . and we can d i dunno w w was there uh a time when we were set up to do that ? it probably will work better if we do it later in the week , after we actually understand uh better what 's going on . phd a : yeah . professor f : so when do you guys leave ?"
