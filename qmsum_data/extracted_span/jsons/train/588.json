    "answer": "project manager : okay . everybody found his place again ? yeah ? that 's nice . okay so this is our second meeting . and uh still failing ? marketing : yeah . project manager : uh now we 're going um into the functional design . um important thing of this phase is that we 're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . so that we can move onto the second uh phase . but first this phase . um first an announcement . there 's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . so marketing : project manager : there 's our ghost mouse again . that that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that 's because of this uh user interface : okay . project manager : it 's in wing c_ and e_ . marketing : okay . project manager : so it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . but it 's going to be cold anyway , so i do n't think you 're gon na need it . user interface : project manager : then our agenda . now first the opening . uh this time i will take the minutes . uh you 're going to have a presentation . all of you . um and we 've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . so uh i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me . and then the decision on the control functions uh which we wan na include and those which we do n't wan na include . so we 've got forty minutes for all of it . so i suggest um let 's start with the first presentation . um who wants to be first ? marketing : think i 'll go first . project manager : okay . so marketing : project manager : just maybe it 's easier if you um yeah i think you will tell your presentation as well . just which function you have and what you 're gon na talk about . marketing : 'kay . my name is freek van ponnen . i 'm the market expert . but you already knew that . um i 've done some research . we have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . we had one hundred of these uh test subjects . uh in addition we did some market research . uh see what the market consists of . what ages are involved . well these are three quite astonishing results , i thought . um remotes are being considered ugly . f uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . so um in addition remotes were not very functional . fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . so some things . then we did some research to the most relevant functions . channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . the power button got a nine . and teletext got a six and a half . so these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . then there are some one-time use function . that 's what i like to call them . that uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . then these are the this is the market . um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . um main characteristic of this group is that they 're very critical on the remote control . um they like to use new f new functions . but they also are very critical . they wo n't spend their money very easily . so um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market . they are not really very interested in features . but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . what i think this indicates for our um design . i think we should make a remote for the future . and this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . um the results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s_ r_s_i_ . um this is certainly something to take into account . and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design . besides of course that the remote must look very nice . and the functionality as a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , i think we should make very few buttons . uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . uh i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'cause they 're used most and so they should be robust . they should n't break down easily . um then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and i say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . but it might be a good idea to make a docking station . and this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . so you 'd know where it is in the room . and in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an lcd screen in the remote control would be preferred . this was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . but up till forty five it remains feasible . this would also greatly increase the production costs but i think these are just some small factors we could consider . project manager : okay . marketing : that would be all . project manager : thank you . so anybody have um any questions until now ? marketing : any questions ? project manager : about functional requirements ? user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : that 's clear . now to the second . marketing : 'kay . project manager : user interface : uh okay . um i 've been looking at uh the user interface of it . um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . um project manager : yeah . yeah you can take your time . user interface : okay . project manager : we 've got uh plenty of time , so marketing : you should go to the top thingy . slide show . project manager : yeah . there it is . yeah . user interface : okay . marketing : oh yeah . user interface : um yeah . i think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . uh uh i 've do i 've uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it , um about uh interface but uh uh yeah i i 've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . uh so uh you 've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh d_v_d_ uh uh television , uh stereo . so um but uh it must be uh user-friendly . so um uh you c you ca n't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh yeah . uh uh uh yeah . in one um remote control . project manager : one remote . user interface : but um yeah . um yeah . got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control . project manager : user interface : um few uh buttons but uh this uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . um uh people uh do n't like it , uh so um well what uh i was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . so uh like uh the on-off uh button . uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you do n't have to change that . um my personal uh preferences um . use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . so um wh what i was th uh thinking about was um you 've got um uh this the remote control uh project manager : industrial designer : user interface : and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh i dunno um and um here you 've got a s kind of a display . it 's a touchscreen . so um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a d_v_d_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh . and um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . so um this button is for a d_v_d_ or so um for every um device you 've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . so uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . project manager : hmm . user interface : so uh that 's uh my uh idea about it . project manager : 'kay . user interface : um yeah and uh let 's see . uh yeah . so a touchscreen . uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . we better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . everybody uh have to use it so uh ol even even old people um young people . so uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . so uh um project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . uh yeah . that was uh my uh part of it . project manager : okay . user interface : so project manager : anybody has questions about the technical functions ? industrial designer : i think if we are gon na use a touchscreen uh we 're gon na go way above the twelve and a half euros . project manager : yeah . user interface : n i i do n't think so . uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . s um it 's uh not uh in colour or something . project manager : touchscreen . user interface : uh it 's just uh um one colo uh yeah . uh i seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it 's uh for uh twenty uh euros or uh less uh . so it 's possible . project manager : 'kay . that 's nice . uh marketing : well it would certainly make a fancy design . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but the it would n't be very robust . marketing : so industrial designer : it 's very fragile and you can get scratches on it . marketing : that is true . project manager : that 's right . user interface : yeah that 's true . project manager : uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ? marketing : we would have to look into that . project manager : uh and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design . industrial designer : that 's . okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : marketing : project manager : i think it 's going to uh it 's not too much . okay . industrial designer : okay i 've got a presentation about the working design . um first about how it works . it 's really simple of course . everybody knows how a remote works . the user presses a button . the remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the tv . the tv switches to the frequency , or what function it is . so we 've got um the the plate . it gots conductive disks for every button . when the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the tv . it 's a very simple device , technically speaking . so this is a schematic overview . you 've got the buttons . the power source . and uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . the chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . well um i think we should use default materials , simple plastics . keep the inner workings simple , so it 's robust . uh i think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you 're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . and uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . so it 's , in my idea , it 's uh it 's gon na be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . that 's it . project manager : okay . thank you . okay . marketing : project manager : uh okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . um i 'm the project manager so i 'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : project manager : um that 's , we 've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for tv . um that 's because uh it will be too complex user interface : okay . project manager : and the time to market will be too big , if we wan na have it uh for more functions . so it has to be simple . uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . and uh it 's a function we do n't need in our remote control . marketing : project manager : um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . uh that 's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . um this is uh a bit pity for the marketing uh expert . marketing : user interface : project manager : because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . so we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control , and the other way round . and we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . and uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . so i suggest let 's have a discussion on the control functions . yeah . marketing : so is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? project manager : uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wan na use and the market we wan na reach with our product . um user interface : mm . marketing : yeah 'cause you 're you 're saying that teletext is gon na be an old feature and it 's not gon na be used anymore anyway pretty soon . and new tvs will have internet access on them . project manager : marketing : but i think if you 're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a tv with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . user interface : yeah . marketing : in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . so i think it 's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . i 'm pretty much against it . project manager : against the no teletext ? marketing : yes . project manager : um marketing : besides that , i think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . but i mean if i s if i see this , it 's i think we 're just gon na go for another project manager : yeah it 's it is user interface : forty project manager : standard remote . marketing : pretty project manager : no i think we can marketing : and not innovative project manager : i think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons marketing : remote control . project manager : which were also mentioned . uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wan na reach because it is forty percent of the market . user interface : yeah . project manager : and um if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it 's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . marketing : yes but it 's not the biggest part of the market . and besides that , they 're not very critical so i mean they do n't really care what the remote control is like . they 'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . project manager : but do n't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think the people think that 's the the device i 've looked for although i did n't realise it . user interface : project manager : so let 's try it . marketing : no . i think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control . user interface : yeah . marketing : people of forty plus , i mean they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it 's okay with them . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i think that if we 're if we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um i do n't know if you 've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? marketing : so project manager : yeah . it 's a big success . industrial designer : yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , i think . project manager : very big success . marketing : i have n't heard of it . project manager : yeah . uh . i think so as well . industrial designer : we do n't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . we just change our focus on the project , and i think we can uh we can sell this . project manager : uh i simply think um uh that the new products we are gon na make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . and i think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . 'cause what you told is the channel selection is important . volume selection , power and teletext . marketing : yes . project manager : okay . um user interface : yeah . marketing : yes . but obviously the board tends to disagree . project manager : no we we have n't voted yet , so user interface : project manager : uh i think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well . but only if uh if it wo n't higher the the cost , because i do n't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but i do n't think it will be a problem . or is teletext a user interface : but um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . project manager : yeah . user interface : so it 's marketing : yeah , also . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . so i suggest uh marketing : i think it 'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . user interface : it 's project manager : yeah . is anybody um really against teletext ? no ? just that , that we just keep the teletext . i think that 's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . for elderly people they can think , oh i wan na have subtitles , user interface : yeah yeah . project manager : and they push the button and they get the big subtitles . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : uh that 's a good idea . project manager : um so i think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . um functionality should be few buttons , you said . i think uh that 's very important we have a few buttons . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so to keep it simple . marketing : but i do n't think that 's really an issue any more 'cause well might be . user interface : if it 's only for televi marketing : but i mean it , if it 's only for tv you 're not gon na need a lot of buttons anyway . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : you need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , user interface : yeah . marketing : volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but project manager : yeah . but do you need user interface : so we can s we can skip the display , marketing : i think if you if you only l user interface : so uh we do n't need it . project manager : but do you need the buttons for one to zero . maybe c we can user interface : uh marketing : think if you 're gon na include teletext you do . i think many people like to use that . project manager : maybe we can use uh user interface : yeah . marketing : 'cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you do n't wan na push the next channel button thirty five times . user interface : yeah . project manager : no , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? there are other ways too . just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or user interface : yeah . mm-hmm . yeah . marketing : that 's true but um i do n't think there are many tvs that can switch channels that fast . and so you would need like the tv would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . and i dunno if many channels would do have that . if many tvs have that . industrial designer : yeah . and besides that it 's um if we 're gon na focus on elderly people they 'll have to adapt . they 're not used to using scroll buttons . project manager : that 's right . industrial designer : so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : the numbers yeah . yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it 's too much we can uh reconsider it . but i think there wo n't be very much buttons . user interface : yeah . project manager : or there do n't have to be a lot . marketing : but i do n't think i think if you 're gon na make a remote control only to operate a tv , you there 's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 'cause i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a tv , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . i do n't think there 's much to be gained in that area . project manager : the number of buttons ? i think it 's very important in the in the design . marketing : yeah . project manager : you can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with marketing : that is true but i think there 's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you 're making a remote control only for to operate only the tv . project manager : to operate only the tv yeah . marketing : 'cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a tv there 's simply not a lot of buttons required . there 's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do n't have a lot of buttons either . so i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . project manager : 'kay . so we can marketing : that would that would cost a a big marketing expedition project manager : yeah . that 's right . marketing : which was one of the arguments to make it only for the tv because we did n't have the time to market a lot . project manager : yeah . so you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . user interface : project manager : uh uh like other functions . instead of f of less buttons . marketing : maybe . well yeah i think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and but i do n't think we should spend very much time in that . project manager : mm . no . do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ? industrial designer : it should be possible yes . if it 's not too fancy . project manager : 'cause it can be industrial designer : and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : because i think that 's uh that 's a good advantage point as well . if we have a fancy-looking docking station or very that 's a nice requirement . docking station . marketing : industrial designer : so we 're just gon na focus on the extras ? project manager : i think so . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah i think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a project manager : yeah . marketing : like to have extra in a new remote control . project manager : that 's a good point . um you said they easily get lost as well . marketing : yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . project manager : yeah . so maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . marketing : yeah that was what i suggested . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . marketing : you have it on project manager : yeah . marketing : you have it 's on some phones too , which have a docking station . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing . project manager : yeah . so marketing : so you know where it is . project manager : audio signal should be possible as well . i think it 's not too expensive . uh another point is the lcd screen . um i do n't know if that will rise the cost too much , because industrial designer : y i um i think we 'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause project manager : yeah . it will be too much as well . industrial designer : it 's uh marketing : i think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we 're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . which would tell you what it does . project manager : yeah . marketing : and it would n't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , project manager : based . user interface : okay . yeah . marketing : but project manager : just the lcd . oh just the normal screen . marketing : just a small screen project manager : that 's a good idea . so marketing : with two project manager : some extra info . feedback . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . i think that 's a good idea as well . user interface : yeah . marketing : but i dunno if that would project manager : as the small screen . marketing : that would fit into the costs . project manager : extra button info . i think that should be possible as well . um let 's see what did we say . mm . more . should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . few buttons , we talked about that . docking station , lcd . um general functions yeah . 'kay . and default materials . i think that 's a good idea as well , because um elderly people do n't mind if it 's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . user interface : project manager : so that does n't really matter . so i think we nee marketing : i think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters . project manager : uh let 's um specify the target group . because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . because i think what we 're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . user interface : mm . yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : uh what do we want ? if we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can marketing : i think project manager : target the real elderly people . marketing : i think that would be a if we should do something like that it would be a , i think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company . project manager : yeah . marketing : and i think , i think there would be a good market for it . project manager : so that 's the marketing : if we 're able to really bring an innovative product . project manager : now you 're talking about sixty to eighty for example . marketing : yeah the really project manager : yeah . sixty . marketing : but i 'd have to look into that a little more . project manager : okay . and different cultures . are we industrial designer : well i do n't think they have different television sets uh project manager : okay . industrial designer : in uh every country . 'cause project manager : we 've got five minutes left just now . user interface : so 'kay . project manager : small warning . marketing : 'kay . and with uh the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . you could i think we n it would be a lot easier to project manager : should marketing : adapt it to different cultures . project manager : yeah . in different languages , you know . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : or you have to put a language button in it , user interface : right . project manager : but that will be a bit unnecessary i think . user interface : no . yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's better to put it on different markets with it all . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . so industrial designer : yeah . project manager : that 's the the target . uh then a few small things . marketing : project manager : uh okay . i will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . um what we 're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept , user interface designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching . so just keep in mind the things we 've said about the target group , uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . and uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach . so um marketing : 'kay . project manager : i thank you for this meeting . and i think we have a lunch-break now . marketing : that 's good . project manager : so that 's a good thing . user interface : yeah ."
