    "answer": "professor c : yeah , and so r - one over r - zero is what you typically use for that . phd d : yeah . no , i do n't use that i ca n't use professor c : no , i 'm saying that 's what people us typically use . see , because it because this is this is just like a single number to tell you um `` does the spectrum look like that or does it look like that `` . phd d : mm - hmm . grad a : oh . r r r - zero . professor c : right ? phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : so if it 's if it 's um if it 's low energy uh but the but the spectrum looks like that or like that , it 's probably silence . phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : uh but if it 's low energy and the spectrum looks like that , it 's probably unvoiced . phd d : yeah . professor c : so if you just if you just had to pick two features to determine voiced - unvoiced , you 'd pick something about the spectrum like uh r - one over r - zero , um and r - zero phd d : mm - hmm , ok . professor c : or i i you know you 'd have some other energy measure and like in the old days people did like uh zero crossing counts . phd d : yeah , yeah . professor c : right . s s phd d : well , i can also th use this . professor c : yeah . um , phd d : bec - because the result are a little bit better but we have in a point that everything is more or less the similar more or less similar . professor c : yeah . but um phd d : it 's not quite better . professor c : right , but it seemed to me that what you were what you were getting at before was that there is something about the difference between the original signal or the original fft and with the filter which is what and the variance was one take uh on it . phd d : yeah , i used this too . professor c : right . but it it could be something else . suppose you did n't have anything like that . then in that case , if you have two nets , alright , and this one has three outputs , and this one has f phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : whatever , fifty - six , or something , phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : if you were to sum up the probabilities for the voiced and for the unvoiced and for the silence here , we 've found in the past you 'll do better at voiced - unvoiced - silence than you do with this one . so just having the three output thing does n't does n't really buy you anything . the issue is what you feed it . phd d : yeah . yeah , i have yeah . no phd e : so you 're saying take the features that go into the voiced - unvoiced - silence net and feed those into the other one , as additional inputs , rather than having a separate professor c : w w well that 's another way . phd d : yeah . professor c : that was n't what i was saying but yeah that 's certainly another thing to do . no i was just trying to say if you b if you bring this into the picture over this , what more does it buy you ? and what i was saying is that the only thing i think that it buys you is um based on whether you feed it something different . and something different in some fundamental way . and so the kind of thing that that she was talking about before , was looking at something uh ab um something uh about the difference between the the uh um log fft uh log power uh and the log magnitude uh f f - spectrum uh and the um uh filter bank . phd d : yeah . professor c : and so the filter bank is chosen in fact to sort of integrate out the effects of pitch and she 's saying you know trying so the particular measure that she chose was the variance of this m of this difference , but that might not be the right number . phd d : mm - hmm . maybe . professor c : right ? i mean maybe there 's something about the variance that 's that 's not enough or maybe there 's something else that that one could use , but i think that , for me , the thing that that struck me was that uh you wan na get something back here , so here 's here 's an idea . uh what about it you skip all the all the really clever things , and just fed the log magnitude spectrum into this ? phd d : ah i 'm sorry . professor c : this is f you have the log magnitude spectrum , and you were looking at that and the difference between the filter bank and and c c computing the variance ."
