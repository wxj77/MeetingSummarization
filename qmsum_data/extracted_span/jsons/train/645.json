    "answer": "hon . bill morneau ( minister of finance ) : mr . chair , we continue to manage our fiscal situation in a responsible manner , and we 'll continue to do that . hon . pierre poilievre : how much does the government of canada owe to the people 's republic of china ? hon . bill morneau : mr . chair , we would be happy to provide information . if the member would like to send my office questions directly , i 'd be happy to provide this information . hon . pierre poilievre : it turns out i did a week ago . they still have n't provided answers to the questions , in particular the question regarding who owns canada 's foreign-held debt . we know that roughly a third of our debt is owned by foreigners . how much of that debt is owned by lenders from the people 's republic of china ? hon . bill morneau : mr . chair , as i said , we 'd be happy to reply to these questions directly . we 'll do so . we 'll get to it in order , as we work through this crisis , making sure we focus on canadians first . hon . pierre poilievre : how much is owned by lenders from saudi arabia ? hon . bill morneau : again , mr . chair , we 'd be happy to provide information in this regard should the member wish to send a request directly to my office . hon . pierre poilievre : which i have . mr . chair , moving along to the impacts of the debt on our people , how much would a 1 % increase in the effective interest rate on canada 's national debt cost canadian taxpayers ? hon . bill morneau : mr . chair , we continue to manage our treasury function responsibly . i 'd be happy to get financial calculations to the member if he 'd like to send those directly to my office . hon . pierre poilievre : all right , mr . chair , we 'll try a different question , then , as we 're not getting any answers . we have lower interest rates than ever before . normally , it means you lock in those rates for the long run . anybody who has a mortgage knows you lock in for the long run when rates are low . what percentage of canada 's national debt is locked in for more than five years ? hon . bill morneau : mr . chair , i 'd be happy to get this information to the member , but i would acknowledge that as we manage the treasury function for the government of canada , we look at the short term , the medium term and the long term . we think we have come up with a responsible approach to managing the ongoing debt that we have as a country . hon . pierre poilievre : mr . chair , it turns out , according to department of finance officials , that less than 3 % of canada 's recently added debt since march is for terms of more than five years . why has this minister made canada so susceptible to future interest rate hikes by failing to lock in the $ 371.5 billion of new debt he 's added in the last two and a half months ? hon . bill morneau : mr . chair , we continue to manage the treasury function of the government of canada in a responsible way , making sure we consider what debt should be issued in a short term , a medium term and a long term , which we 've been doing as the government of canada during our entire term and as previous governments have done as well . hon . pierre poilievre : canadians would be wise not to hire this minister as their mortgage broker if they 're looking to get the best rate . let 's move on to the canadian household . the average household was $ 200 away from insolvency before this crisis began . how many canadians would experience bankruptcy in the next 12 months if interest rates were to rise by an effective one percentage point ? hon . bill morneau : mr . chair , again , we 'd be happy to get calculations to the member . i would make the observation that what we 've been working to do during the course of this pandemic is to support canadians and support canadian families by providing them income during a time when they do n't have access to income because they 're actually at home . we think that has supported them in a very , very positive way that allows us to ensure that we will have a continuing economy when we get through this crisis . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : you have 30 seconds left , mr. poilievre . go ahead . hon . pierre poilievre : unfortunately , we will have a $ 1-trillion debt when this fiscal year comes to an end . how much will the finance minister try to raise taxes if interest rates on that debt rise by , say , 1 % ? hon . bill morneau : mr . chair , as i 've said to the house previously , we do not intend to raise taxes . what the member opposite is suggesting is that we should n't be investing to support canadians . i think the approach we 've taken , with the emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy , has been particularly critical for enabling canadians to get through a very challenging time ."
