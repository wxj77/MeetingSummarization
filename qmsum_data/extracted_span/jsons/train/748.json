    "query": "<s> what did grad g think about collecting notes and related data with meetings ?",
    "answer": "phd g : get the summary of the transcript from this time location like you know , and and then while you 're bored you do n't do anything and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a x and { comment } but in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . also with i was thinking and i know morgan disagrees with me on this but suppose you have a group in here and you wan na let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wan na distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an x near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . so . i know we have n't been using it but i w i can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods grad h : right . phd g : which you then get back in a transcript postdoc a : well . professor b : i guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later and and and put some kind of summary or something uh you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . but then you do n't you do n't have the time reference uh that you 'd have if you had it live . phd g : right . and you do n't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , professor b : yeah . phd f : how do you synchronize the time in the crosspad and the time of the recording ? grad h : i mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the crosspads and so that means synchronizing the time postdoc a : mm - hmm . grad h : you know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery postdoc a : well when when i d grad h : and so you so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used , so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wan na do anything with this information . postdoc a : w mm - hmm . phd e : why grad h : and so there 's a lot of infrastructure which postdoc a : there is an alternative . grad h : unless someone postdoc a : there is an alternative , i mean , it 's still , there 's uh you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , but it does n't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . you c i mean , i when i when i did it i synchronized it by voice , by whispering `` one , two , three , four `` onto the microphone and uh , you know . grad h : well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end phd e : right . grad h : which someone has to listen to that and find that point , postdoc a : yeah , it 's transcribed . it 's in the transcript . grad h : and then mark it . postdoc a : yeah . well it 's in the transcript . phd g : well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? would h i mean is there a big cau grad h : we can keep all both of them for the whole whole year . phd g : just just in case we grad h : i mean , it 's just phd g : even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate uh f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but i it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out . professor b : well one thing that we might try um is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe edu is the right one or maybe something else , we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . i mean , phd g : right . professor b : uh part of the reason i think part of the reason that adam was so interested in uh the speechcorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and and so forth so and and jane is more into it but eh uh you know i do n't know if you wan na really do do this all the time so i think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . um and if so , it 's probably worth having one . the p the the problem with the the more extended view , all these other you know with uh quibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to um uh routinely use it , i mean it just has n't happened anyway . but maybe if we can get a person to phd g : yeah i do n't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wan na make a note of , like what jane was talking about with some later browsing , just just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute . phd e : well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a pda with a wireless card . and and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the the linux server and uh phd g : so what kind of input would you be ? phd e : so so , i mean , if you 're not worried about grad h : buttons . phd g : you 'd just be pressing like a a phd e : well well you have a pda and may and you could have the same sort of x interface or whatever , i mean , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . phd g : mm - hmm . phd e : but you could imagine , phd g : yeah , that be good . phd e : i mean , if if all you really wanted was you did n't want this secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , a pda with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go . i mean even buttons you could do , sort of , i mean , as you said . grad h : i mean for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , phd g : m right . phd e : right . phd g : that would be fine too . grad h : right ? you have the phd g : i mean , i do n't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but i 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and postdoc a : i like this pda idea . yeah . professor b : yeah , i do like the idea of having a couple buttons phd g : yeah . grad h : well i 'm sure there would postdoc a : yeah . professor b : where like one one button was `` uh - oh `` and then another button was `` that 's great `` and another button `` that 's f `` phd g : or like this is my `` i 'm supposed to do this `` kind of button , postdoc a : yeah . phd g : like `` i better remember to `` grad h : action item . phd g : yeah something like that or postdoc a : and then grad h : i mean i think the crosspad idea is a good one . postdoc a : uh - huh . grad h : it 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work . i mean that 's part of the reason why it has n't happened is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me"
