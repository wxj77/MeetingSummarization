    "answer": "grad d : label it . phd g : oh ok . postdoc e : so this is where chuck 's , um , overall h architecture comes in , phd g : i see . postdoc e : where we 're gon na have a master file of the channelized data . um , there will be scripts that are written to convert it into these t these main two uses and th some scripts will take it down th e into a f a for ta take it to a format that 's usable for the recognizer an uh , other scripts will take it to a form that 's usable for the for linguistics an and discourse analysis . and , um , the implication that that i have is that th the master copy will stay unchanged . these will just be things that are generated , and e by using scripts . grad d : master copies of superset . postdoc e : when things change then the the script will cham change but the but there wo n't be stored copies of in different versions of things . grad d : good . phd g : so , i guess i 'd have one request here which is just , um , maybe to make it more robust , th that the tag , whatever you would choose for this type of `` nums `` { comment } where it 's inside the spontaneous speech , is different than the tag that you use for the read speech . phd b : right . right . that would argue for changing the other ones to be `` digits `` or something . phd g : um , that way w if we make a mistake parsing , or something , we do n't see the `` point five `` , or or it 's not there , then we phd b : mm - hmm . phd g : a just an and actually for things like `` seven eighths `` , or people do fractions too i guess , you maybe you want one overall tag for sort of that would be similar to that , postdoc e : except phd g : or as long as they 're sep as they 're different strings that we that 'll make our p sort of processing more robust . postdoc e : well phd g : cuz we really will get rid of everything that has the `` nums `` string in it . phd b : i suppose what you could do is just make sure that you get rid of everything that has `` curly brace nums curly brace `` . postdoc e : well ex - exactly . phd b : i mean that would be the postdoc e : exactly . that was that was my motivation . and i these can be changed , like i said . phd g : yeah . postdoc e : you know , i mean , as i said i was considering changing it to `` digits `` . and , it just i you know , it 's just a matter of deciding on whatever it is , and being sure the scripts know . phd b : right . phd g : it would probably be safer , if you 're willing , to have a separate tag just because um , then we know for sure . and we can also do counts on them without having to do the processing . but you 're right , we could do it this way , it it should work . um , phd b : yeah , and it makes it i guess the thing about phd g : but it it 's probably not hard for a person to tell the difference phd b : yeah . phd g : because one 's in the context of a you know , a transcribed word string , phd b : right . postdoc e : the other thing is you can get really so minute with these things phd g : and so postdoc e : and increase the size of the files and the re and decrease the readability to such an extent by simply something like `` percent `` . now i i could have adopted a similar convention for `` percent `` , but somehow percent is not so hard , you know ? i it 's just when you have these points and you 're trying to figure out where the decimal places are and we could always add it later . percent 's easy to detect . point however is is uh a word that has a couple different meanings . and you 'll find both of those in one of these meetings , where he 's saying `` well the first point i wan na make is so - and - so `` and he goes through four points , and also has all these decimals . phd b : so liz , what does the recognizer do , what does the sri recognizer output for things like that ? `` seven point five `` . does it output the word phd g : `` seven point five `` . phd b : right , the word `` seven `` ? grad d : well , the numbers ? phd b : the number `` seven `` ? phd g : the word . phd b : the word `` seven `` , ok . professor f : yeah . phd g : yeah . professor f : so i 'd so `` i 'd like i 'd like to talk about point five `` . phd g : and and actually , you know the language professor f : yeah . phd g : it 's the same point , actually , the the p you know , the word `` to `` and the word y th `` going to `` and `` to go to `` those are two different `` to 's `` and so there 's no distinction there . phd b : mm - hmm . phd g : it 's just just the word `` point `` has yeah , every word has only one , yeah e one version even if even if it 's a actually even like the word `` read `` { comment } and `` read `` those are two different words . they 're spelled the same way , right ? phd b : mm - hmm . phd g : and they 're still gon na be transcribed as read . phd b : mm - hmm . professor f : right . phd g : so , yeah , i i like the idea of having this in there , i just i was a little bit worried that , um , the tag for removing the read speech because i what if we have like `` read letters `` or , i do n't know , grad d : we might wan na just a separate tag that says it 's read . phd g : like `` read something `` like `` read `` grad c : mm - hmm . phd g : yeah , basically . but other than that i it sounds great . grad d : yeah . ok ? are we done ? postdoc e : well i wanted to say also regarding the channelized data , grad d : oh , i guess we 're not done . phd b : yeah . postdoc e : that , um , thilo requested , um , that we ge get some segments done by hand to e e s reduce the size of the time bins wh like was chuc - chuck was mentioning earlier that , um , that , um , if you if you said , `` oh `` and it was in part of a really long , s complex , overlapping segment , that the same start and end times would be held for that one grad d : well postdoc e : as for the longer utterances , grad d : we did that for one meeting , right , postdoc e : and grad d : so you have that data do n't you ? phd a : yeah , that 's the training data . postdoc e : and he requested that there be , uh , similar , uh , samples done for five minute stretches c involving a variety of speakers and overlapping secti sections . phd a : yeah . postdoc e : he gave me he did the very nice , he he did some shopping through the data and found segments that would be useful . and at this point , all four of the ones that he specified have been done . in addition the i 've i have the transcribers expanding the amount that they 're doing actually . phd a : oh great . postdoc e : so right now , um , i know that as of today we got an extra fifteen minutes of that type , and i 'm having them expand the realm on either side of these places where they 've already started . phd a : oh great . ok ."
