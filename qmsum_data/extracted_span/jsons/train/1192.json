    "answer": "project manager : now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation . marketing : okay , i 'll take my file down so you can bring it up . 'kay should be able to get it now . 'kay , why do n't you move just to the next slide right away . project manager : you wan na go to the next slide ? marketing : yeah right away . project manager : okay . marketing : okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we have n't thought of . user interface : okay . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : we ca n't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we do n't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we wo n't sell any . industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm . marketing : so we have to get some input from those people . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it 's good , we 're gon na get behind it and sell it . um , next slide please . okay , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i did n't want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we 've got that . the size is small , the colour 's bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we 'll have the soft buttons industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : and the way this is shaped , even though it 's gon na be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that 's nice . and functionality i put last on my list because people are n't going to use it before they buy it . industrial designer : marketing : so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that 's what people are gon na get in the store . user interface : fee selling . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : they do n't have a television in the store , they ca n't play with it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um so they 'll be our main selling points . so um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please . okay , so um the shape um i think is a a one . that 's really , really excellent shape . the size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these are n't i in how i feel . i think that it 's i think that it 's plenty small enough to sell but i think we 're sort of right the scale is one to seven . i think we 're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors . user interface : okay . marketing : and our colour i think is great . the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . and given um the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we 'd disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . user interface : okay . industrial designer : mm-hmm ."
