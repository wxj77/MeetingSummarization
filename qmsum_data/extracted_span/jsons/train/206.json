    "answer": "project manager : um . so we 're gon na have like individual work and then a meeting about it . and repeat that process three times . um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . um . so uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . so who would like to go first ? marketing : i will go . that 's fine . project manager : very good . marketing : alright . so this one here , right ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . very nice . alright . my favourite animal is like a beagle . project manager : marketing : um charac favourite characteristics of it ? is that right ? project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . and , yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health . industrial designer : marketing : so this is blue . blue beagle . my family 's beagle . project manager : right . marketing : project manager : lovely . user interface : well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . project manager : industrial designer : user interface : then they 're small cute and furry , and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , i 'm gon na be up there with them . marketing : industrial designer : cool . project manager : right . user interface : industrial designer : there 's too much gear . project manager : you can take as long over this as you like , because we have n't got an awful lot to discuss . industrial designer : project manager : ok oh we do we do user interface : project manager : do n't feel like you 're in a rush , anyway . industrial designer : okay . marketing : i coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . project manager : ach why not marketing : boy , let me tell you . project manager : we might have to get you up again then . user interface : project manager : i do n't know what mine is . i 'm gon na have to think on the spot now . marketing : impressionist . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : ca n't draw . user interface : project manager : is that a whale ? industrial designer : yeah . um , well anyway , i do n't know , it 's just the first animal i can think off the top of my head . um . yes . big reason is 'cause i 'm allergic to most animals . allergic to animal fur , so um fish was a natural choice . um , yeah , and i kind of like whales . they come in and go eat everything in sight . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : and they 're quite harmless and mild and interesting . marketing : alright . mm . project manager : okay . god , i still do n't know what i 'm gon na write about . um . marketing : superb sketch , by the way . industrial designer : tail 's a bit big , i think . project manager : i was gon na choose a dog as well . marketing : project manager : but i 'll just draw a different kind of dog . m my favourite animal is my own dog at home . um that does n't really look like him , actually . he looks more like a pig , actually . ah well . marketing : i see a dog in there . project manager : do you ? user interface : project manager : oh that 's very good of you . marketing : yep . now i see a rooster . industrial designer : project manager : user interface : marketing : what kind is it ? project manager : um he 's a mixture of uh various things . um and what do i like about him , um that 's just to suggest that his tail wags . marketing : industrial designer : project manager : um he 's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um uh and he 's quite quite wee as well so you know he can does n't take up too much space . marketing : project manager : um and uh and he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , industrial designer : project manager : which is quite amusing , so marketing : is he aware that th it 's his own cha tail he 's chasing ? project manager : it is . i think it is . he only does it after he 's had his dinner marketing : project manager : and um he 'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . industrial designer : it 's an after dinner dog then . project manager : yeah , so uh marketing : probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . project manager : yeah , maybe . maybe . right , um where did you find this ? marketing : project manager : just down here ? yeah . industrial designer : project manager : okay . um what are we doing next ? uh um . okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . um so according to the brief um we 're gon na be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , um and we 're aiming to make fifty million euro . um so we 're gon na be selling this on an international scale . and uh we do n't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . marketing : 'kay . um , can we just go over that again ? project manager : sure . marketing : uh , so bas at twel alright , yeah . okay . so cost like production cost is twelve fifty , project manager : all together . marketing : but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ? like on the shelf . project manager : um i dunno . i imagine that 's a good question . marketing : our sale our sale anyway . project manager : i imagine it probably is our sale actually marketing : yeah , okay okay . project manager : because it 's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . um . marketing : okay . mm-hmm . project manager : but i i do n't know , marketing : alright . project manager : i mean do you think the fact that it 's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? marketing : yes . project manager : think it will ? um . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : hmm . marketing : well right away i 'm wondering if there 's um th th uh , like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones . project manager : oh yeah , regions and stuff , yeah . marketing : um f frequencies or something project manager : yeah . okay . marketing : um as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . project manager : yeah . well for a remote control , do you think that will be i suppose it 's depends on how complicated our remote control is . marketing : i do n't know . yeah . industrial designer : it does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons . project manager : yeah , yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so , possibly . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : and then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . i 'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it 'll be different , so project manager : what , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? marketing : just a chara just a characteristic of the project manager : like how much money people have to spend on things like ? marketing : just or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london , might not be such a big hit in greece , who knows , project manager : aye , i see what you mean , yeah . marketing : something like that , yeah . project manager : marketing . good marketing thoughts . marketing : yep . project manager : oh gosh , i should be writing all this down . um . marketing : right away i 'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we 're given here , thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , project manager : yeah . marketing : something other than just standard . um so i 'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five euros , is that sort of the thi is this gon na to be like the premium product kinda thing or project manager : yeah , yeah . like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . marketing : uh-huh . project manager : well twenty five euro , i mean that 's um that 's about like eighteen pounds or something , is n't it ? or no , is it as much as that ? marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . marketing : yep . yeah , i 'd say so , yeah . project manager : um , i dunno , i 've never bought a remote control , so i do n't know how how good a remote control that would get you . um . marketing : no . yeah , yeah . project manager : but yeah , i suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um right , okay . let me just scoot on ahead here . okay . um well d does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? thin marketing : do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other project manager : no , actually . that would be useful , though , marketing : other project manager : would n't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now . marketing : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , i just do n't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . project manager : yeah , yeah . marketing : it 's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . project manager : oh . five minutes to end of meeting . marketing : it just comes along . project manager : oh , okay . we 're a bit behind . marketing : do you know what i mean ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : like so sort of like how do you i i mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . or another way is maybe people who have tv sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something . user interface : i know um my parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . marketing : but right . right . user interface : so um for them it was just how many devices control . marketing : okay so right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses project manager : yeah . right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , marketing : i think so . project manager : do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ? marketing : yeah , yeah . yeah . well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . they 're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , m_p_ three players , telephones , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : everything , agenda . so , like , i wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , project manager : yeah . marketing : such as the lighting in your house , or um project manager : or even like , you know , notes about um what you wan na watch . like you might put in there oh i want to watch such and such and look a marketing : yeah , yeah . project manager : oh that 's a good idea . so extra functionalities . marketing : an yeah . like , p personally for me , at home i 've i 've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my d_v_d_ player and my c_d_ player . so they w all work actually function together but i have different remote controls for each of them . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so it 's sort of ironic that that then they 're in there um you know , the sound and everything it 's just one system . but each one 's got its own little part . project manager : um okay , uh i 'd wel we 're gon na have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . um i 'll just check we 've nothing else . okay . um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they do n't like about remote controls they 've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ? industrial designer : and you keep losing them . project manager : you keep losing them . okay . industrial designer : finding them is really a pain , you know . marketing : mm . mm . industrial designer : i mean it 's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : or it 's kicked under the table . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : w you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : you know . marketing : that 's just really good id yep . project manager : there i mean is that something we 'd want to include , do you think ? marketing : uh , project manager : dunno . marketing : sure . project manager : okay maybe . marketing : i remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . actually had a cable between it and the tv project manager : marketing : and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . project manager : my goodness . marketing : and um , you know , when i think about what they are now , it 's better , but actually it 's still kind of , i dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . project manager : still feels quite primitive . marketing : maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . s project manager : maybe like a touch screen or something ? marketing : something like that , yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : or whatever would be technologically reasonable . project manager : uh-huh , okay . well i guess that 's up to our industrial designer . marketing : 'cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that does n't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having project manager : it looks better . marketing : you know , these days there 's a r pe things in people 's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know . project manager : yeah . marketing : um , nicer materials project manager : okay . marketing : and might be project manager : okay . marketing : be worth exploring anyway . project manager : right , well um so just to wrap up the next meeting 's gon na be in thirty minutes . so that 's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you 're gon na be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you 're doing there . um for user interface , technical functions , i guess that 's you know like what we 've been talking about , what it 'll actually do . um and uh marketing executive , you 'll be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you 'll all get instructions emailed to you , i guess . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah , so it 's th the functional design stage is next , i guess . and uh and that 's the end of the meeting . so i got that little message a lot sooner than i thought i would , so marketing : um . before we wrap up , just to make sure we 're all on the same page here , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um , do we we were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something , project manager : uh-huh , yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : right ? well , um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? project manager : th okay , well just very quickly marketing : i i do n't know . project manager : 'cause this we 're supposed to finish now . um i guess that 's up to us , marketing : yep . yeah , sure . project manager : i mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , so um , you know marketing : okay . industrial designer : i think one factor would be production cost . marketing : okay , yeah . industrial designer : because there 's a cap there , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . um . marketing : okay . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . industrial designer : i think that that 's the main factor . project manager : yeah . okay . marketing : okay . project manager : right , okay , we 'll that 's that 's the end of the meeting , then . um marketing : alright . project manager : so , uh marketing : project manager : thank you all for coming . industrial designer : cool ."
