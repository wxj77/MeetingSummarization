    "query": "<s> why did john williamson disagree with the government when putting forward inquiries towards service canada ?",
    "answer": "mr. john williamson ( new brunswick southwest , cpc ) : thank you , mr . chair . i will say that this is no substitute for parliament , but i appreciate the opportunity . new brunswick families and businesses are rapidly making adjustments to manage and live with the coronavirus pandemic . businesses here are opening and services are being offered . families are preparing for summer and even planning ahead for a new school year in september . we have a lot of work ahead of us . one notable absence is service canada . when does the government plan on opening its service counters to assist canadians again ? hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr . chair , our government is committed to ensuring that canadians continue to have access to the benefits that they rely on through service canada . we have redeployed over 3,000 additional staff to ensure that canadians continue to have access to their benefits . we 've established a 1,500-agent call centre to make sure that people can get access to the phone lines to get the help they need . mr. john williamson : service canada is about more than providing covid-19 information and benefits . provincial governments are working hard to adjust to canada 's new normal by opening up businesses and front-line government services . when will we see service canada play its role and open its service counters in our communities ? hon . ahmed hussen : mr . chair , we 're currently working with our world-class public health experts to determine how best to reopen the service canada network for the public . make no mistake : our service canada employees have gone above and beyond to ensure that canadians continue to have access to the services that they rely on and the benefits that they need . mr. john williamson : please do n't hide behind health experts when the prime minister is appearing in the middle of large protests , yet is afraid to bring back the parliament of canada to do its business . in fact , the new brunswick legislature is open for regular business . bills are being studied , opposition input is being heard and mlas are voting on legislation , not rubber-stamping government bills . by comparison , our parliament is stuck in pretending it can not function like other law-making assemblies . canadians are in the dark about our country 's finances . when will the government table an economic update so taxpayers understand what was spent , what is owed by our kids and grandchildren , and what the government 's fiscal footing looks like ? hon . pablo rodriguez : mr . chair , nobody 's hiding . nobody 's doing anything like that . the only reason my colleague is able to ask a question and i 'm able to answer his question is that he 's right there on the screen . we have this hybrid format that cares for mps across the country , not only the ones sitting in the house . mr. john williamson : this is no substitute for parliament . i will ask my question again . when will the government table an economic update so that taxpayers understand what was spent , what is owed by our kids and grandchildren , and what the government 's fiscal footing looks like in today 's environment ? hon . mona fortier : mr . chair , i thank my honourable colleague for his question . canada 's economy is still in a period of extraordinary uncertainty due to covid-19 . we have been open and transparent about the measures we have been providing to support families , businesses and workers . even our health care the chair : we 'll go back to mr. williamson . mr. john williamson : except you have not . the auditor general is underfunded . we have no idea about the total of government spending . again i will ask when the government will table an economic update so that we can have an understanding of what the government 's fiscal footing looks like . hon . mona fortier : mr . chair , we have included biweekly reports to parliament on the full cost and status of our economic response plan measures since the beginning . i have said , and i will continue to say , that when it is possible to provide a clear economic projection , we will provide an update . mr. john williamson : what is the full cost to date of the government 's covid-19 relief measures , as the minister just claimed the government has provided to parliament ?"
