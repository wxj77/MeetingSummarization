    "answer": "hefin david am : one of the things that the national association of head teachers told us was that they would n't want the cost of that kind of training to come from core budgets . would you agree with that ? julie morgan am : well , i would have thought this sort of measure would be incorporated into the training they were using already , actually . i wouldn't have seen it would need something completely separate . hefin david am : so , you think it should come from the core budget that they use for training ? julie morgan am : i think it could be incorporated in what they 're already doing . hefin david am : okay . and do you think that would be a significant additional cost or do you think that that would be minimal ? julie morgan am : i would have thought it would be minimal . they already have training courses about childcare issues , and this would be something that would be absorbed into that . hefin david am : you mentioned the implementation group and the fact that educators are represented on it . can you just be a bit clearer about how they are represented again ? i 'm not sure i caught that . julie morgan am : do you want to , karen , because you were at the group ? karen cornish : yes . so , education are represented on it through the association of directors of education in wales , and they have a representative on the strategic implementation group , and we are working with them to understand who else will be on the task and finish groups that we 're setting up that the minister 's already talked about . and we 've also had conversations with all of the trade unions . i personally went and spoke to them earlier in the year when the bill was being introduced , received their feedback and have said that i will go back and speak with them . hefin david am : okay . the things that are being raised so far\u2014would you say they 're reflective of the concerns that the naht rose about , for example , funding of training ? are those kinds of issues raised ? the practical implications of introducing this bill\u2014are they raised ? if not , what other issues might be raised ?"
