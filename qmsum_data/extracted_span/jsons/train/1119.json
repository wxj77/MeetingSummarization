    "answer": "project manager : so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . um no teletext . um so we do n't have to worry about that . um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . and our corporate colours are grey and yellow . and we could probably get away with black too but so those are the three um the three new requirements that that i was told we need to use . um from all all three of your uh presentations , i think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . we want something that looks good . um we want something that 's simple . we want something that you can find easily . um and the speech recognition i i guess is kind of uh give or take . it 's gon na cost more . s the young the younger people say that they like it . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : but um it 's probably , i would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . so maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . um and that way we can focus on our form . user interface : i did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . is that if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wan na call it . um that you you should put it back in . your remote . but if you do n't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . just by infrared . that should n't be too complex i would 've thought . project manager : that 'd be , that 'd be good if we were going with our our ball . user interface : yeah it would be quite good . project manager : or or with you know i guess with any form that that would be good . user interface : the ball could sit on a project manager : you know that could be the charger . for you know user interface : yeah . project manager : we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . and that would be or solar . or you know however , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . um user interface : yeah . project manager : with the locator button . um and if it were the ball you 'd no longer have to have a flat space on it . user interface : yeah . project manager : um like industrial designer : you still do . project manager : we still have the how to hold on to it industrial designer : you s you still w yeah . you put it on t on the couch table . project manager : it 's gon na roll away . industrial designer : while you 're watching , marketing : rolls away industrial designer : it 's gon na roll off . so marketing : yeah . industrial designer : that 's not an issue really . project manager : um so i guess after the meeting we 'll have some questionnaires . and uh and some summaries for for what 's going on . um then we 'll take lunch . then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . um i 'll do the minutes . uh let 's see . it looks like you 're already on your way for uh working with the components . um chips , the what chips we need industrial designer : . project manager : and what uh you know how to power it and whatnot . user interface concept , we want it to be something simple . user interface : yeah . project manager : um minimal number of buttons . i guess our , i guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : right . that 's project manager : did you have time earlier to to work on that . did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ? marketing : not really . user interface : i 'll yeah i 'll have a look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break . project manager : 'kay . user interface : i th i i do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . the ball is probably not a good idea . and even something that 's held like that might be difficult . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so that i think it still has to be a variation . on maybe a a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle . project manager : um shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ? that way we could l i mean if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it 's um a certain look to the remote . or girls or older people ? um would that you think that would help us find um a specific form ? that we would would wan na pick out ? user interface : d i do n't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . i find anything more on that . marketing : mm . yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we 'll have some info on that . project manager : 'kay . so um we know that the remote 's gon na have to be we 'll just say we 've got a colour scheme for it . um yellow and user interface : yeah . project manager : you know yellow it 's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . and our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom marketing : project manager : or the user interface : bottom perhaps project manager : you know . um user interface : yeah . project manager : maybe we could sketch a so basically all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . you know . um maybe we could flare it or something . you know . so it 's more of course this will look like a bone then . marketing : industrial designer : project manager : go ahead and erase this . um hope everyone memorised that uh user interface : you i mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they 've been going . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : they 've gone from big brick block things , which is a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things . project manager : yeah everybody 's got a mobile phone right ? except for me now . uh user interface : marketing : project manager : but they are all , industrial designer : project manager : you know , mobile phones um they 've kind of taken a turn to where they 're really small . um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : right . project manager : but then again you do n't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big marketing : project manager : and you had a handbag to carry it around in . um user interface : project manager : so we 've got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we 're what we 're stuck with . um maybe we could go with a square or something . um user interface : to the thumb yeah . maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . industrial designer : right . you can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . with the lesser used functions on this part , user interface : yeah . behind . industrial designer : and then it slides into that part . and out . user interface : definitely . just like o on a sort of side view . something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . so you know you just sort of have your hand industrial designer : mm well i was just thinking , this this of course causes user interface : yeah . right on the and your thumb would be up here type thing . industrial designer : causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . so . user interface : yeah that 's also true . instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . industrial designer : right . user interface : but i mean the older so project manager : yeah is everyone who in here 's right-handed , left-handed ? you guys all right-handed ? marketing : right . industrial designer : right . user interface : right-handed , project manager : yeah . so user interface : yeah . project manager : i 'm left-handed but i , so i can say that most things are designed for right-handed people . industrial designer : that 's right . marketing : uh-huh . project manager : like the written language . or english . industrial designer : user interface :"
