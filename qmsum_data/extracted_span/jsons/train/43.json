    "query": "<s> what did the team discuss during the product evaluation ?",
    "answer": "project manager : um , n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now , marketing : okay . so f just go through onto the whiteboard i guess . not sure how this is gon na come out . so the first one was really very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ? 'cause if we 're only going to make it for eight euros then we have a project manager : mm , well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight euros we must think how can we improve it . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and then i mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half euro marketing : mm-hmm . yep . project manager : and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five euros industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five euro . industrial designer : functionality . marketing : okay so look and feel , innovation user interface : and now it easy to use . marketing : industrial designer : easy to use . target . marketing : mm-hmm . and trends . oh , you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? is that part of both of them or ? project manager : um well w w we can still discuss that . marketing : okay . project manager : so um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but um i 've received uh a framework which we can do this . i mean did you have this this excel sheet ? marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : no okay , this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , industrial designer : project manager : so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve euro uh fifty cents uh . marketing : mm-hmm . okay . project manager : so maybe we can start with this , uh , calling this one . marketing : okay . yep . so it 's the pink . project manager : th th this is the first design . marketing : and the other one 's green . okay , so look and feel ? where um one is i 've broken the pen again . s project manager : uh there is another pen . marketing : yeah . get that one . um w one 's bad and seven 's the best . sorry , one 's true and seven 's false . one 's the best . project manager : okay . marketing : so on a scale of one to seven ? project manager : 'kay . okay . so . look and feel . well you already feel that uh pretty much i think . user interface : project manager : in i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm , yeah . mm-hmm . project manager : so i i i would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but that 's just half , we should also consider look , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and then i it looks quite conventional . do n't you agree ? user interface : mm yeah . marketing : on the scale u it 's between functional and fancy basically we 're looking at , project manager : so maybe two . hmm . hmm . ma ma ma ma maybe say say five marketing : so project manager : i it 's my opinion , but i do n't know what what user interface : well i will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it 's like the surf as you say marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : you know . it though the look is fine but uh still i will give four in that case industrial designer : yeah . four maybe . user interface : you know . marketing : four ? okay . project manager : four , four . user interface : four yeah project manager : now we th th user interface : that marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : then we settle on four . user interface : yeah . i will gi yeah . project manager : 'kay . can you maybe fix the other industrial designer : uh . yeah . if you press like this not like this then you marketing : no that 's the ink 's dried . user interface : c can you get the batteries ? no no the battery has fallen down , marketing : battery 's low , is n't it the ink ? user interface : that 's i marketing : the b that 's the that that one ? user interface : yeah . marketing : battery there . industrial designer : but user interface : no no it 's not that , it 's how to close a battery . industrial designer : okay . user interface : okay ? now it should be . marketing : mm . no i think it 's lost a battery . project manager : mm , try it , just try it . marketing : no it 's it would still write project manager : oh it will not marketing : but it would n't pick it up with the sensors . project manager : ri mm , mm . user interface : is there another battery there ? oh yeah . marketing : you got a second ? industrial designer : try a marketing : well we wo n't be able to tell . project manager : yes , it it has a mm . user interface : industrial designer : perfect . marketing : is that working ? industrial designer : marketing : did it come out ? good . okay . project manager : good . good . marketing : because we 'll be able to see it still even if it was n't working , it 's just a normal whiteboard marker industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : but it would n't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard . project manager : okay . so then then marketing : and the other one ? user interface : marketing : i think it 's slightly better , um , project manager : ah . mm . marketing : it 's hard to tell from just the plasticine , project manager : i i i marketing : but project manager : when we want to include i i i 'm doubting about this this component . it it it it breaks in your industrial designer : maybe user interface : no actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , marketing : okay . user interface : it it 's n i it is jus industrial designer : it 's not a button it 's a led , it 's a user interface : it 's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve industrial designer : ac actually yeah it should be embedded . project manager : mm , yes i see , mm okay . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . user interface : it 's will be embedded there industrial designer : yeah . oh user interface : so it wo n't be really you know protruding or something . industrial designer : you can push push it again , you can push it . marketing : yeah . the other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? user interface : yeah . marketing : 'cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : maybe it wo n't work so well . user interface : no you it it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that marketing : okay . project manager : well r r marketing : i 'd say two or three for that one , personally . probably more towards three than two . project manager : i think the look is better industrial designer : project manager : but the feel is is is worse . so so i would also say this is four . marketing : okay . project manager : but w w do you what do you think ? user interface : uh it 's fine i think . my just that um the feel is that um you right now you you do n't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it 's embedded one . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm . mm . yes . user interface : this is how embedded one will project manager : yes , it basically is the same shape . user interface : yeah . it 's a bas basically the same thing actually . project manager : mm-hmm . mm . user interface : you will be except that in this c industrial designer : and the lcd makes it better . yeah . user interface : yeah project manager : yeah . yeah . yeah . user interface : and you might have a slight thing for to forward and marketing : mm , okay . yeah industrial designer : so i will say two . marketing : it 's d it 's definitely more fancier than that one . project manager : yes , okay . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : i would say two , three . marketing : okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : so , consensus ? two or three ? project manager : mm . two 's good user interface : looking like marketing : um , 'kay . innovation . the first one , not really muc industrial designer : basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , marketing : mm . yeah . industrial designer : right ? marketing : do we user interface : no but except for the design of the surf . industrial designer : yeah . the surf uh design . marketing : what what features are we actually including ? user interface : you should be rea marketing : are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? user interface : uh no marketing : there 's nothing like that ? user interface : i think it 's more of the feel . marketing : but th is there any there 's no actual innovation in that at all , it 's just a straight-out remote control . user interface : yeah , yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : the only innova innovation is the shape . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : say about that . marketing : okay . project manager : s so that marketing : so there 's no this uh look and feel thing , though that 's not a technological innovation . industrial designer : yeah . you 're right . user interface : yeah . marketing : so i 'd be up for seven for innovation . industrial designer : yeah . and the and the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . and um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part . user interface : yeah , it gives it project manager : yes . a and the lcd screen is industrial designer : yeah . project manager : that 's that 's that 's well it 's quite innovative . industrial designer : and all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . uh could put it at one or two i would say . personally . marketing : okay . project manager : yeah . mm . mm . mm . mm . marketing : so what is it , what are the innovations with this ? got the lcd screen . industrial designer : uh yeah automatic speech recognition . marketing : is that in this one though ? is this 'cause this is the th th there were different options we discussed then , user interface : no , we ha marketing : we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . project manager : we just diske discuss it as you designed it marketing : okay . project manager : and then we will will try to get it in the budget . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so the cost for these were industrial designer : so marketing : what was the cost for the first one ? eight euros ? project manager : eight . industrial designer : eight . well actually we have yeah to check again yeah . user interface : yeah , eight euros yeah . marketing : and this one was sixteen euros . industrial designer : sixteen . user interface : sixteen euros . marketing : okay . so . innovation for this one is two ? one ? user interface : it 's a two , i would say two . industrial designer : w w un to be one what would do we nee actually , yeah , i do n't see project manager : why it is one . industrial designer : okay , one would would be without buttons , . project manager : user interface : project manager : a man w w marketing : mm . well user interface : yeah . marketing : the speech recognition is a very good innovation i believe it , so industrial designer : yeah . so maybe we can put one . project manager : this this is it w with the speech recognition ? industrial designer : it 's using speech recognition , yeah . project manager : well . user interface : okay yeah . project manager : gi given that that it works , marketing : give it a one ? industrial designer : yeah , one , yeah . project manager : then it 's i think one . marketing : okay . ease of use ? user interface : uh industrial designer : so the first one is really standard , so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , user interface : he is used to it act marketing : yeah . industrial designer : right ? user interface : they are used to it actually . marketing : yep . so that 's maybe a a two for ease of use . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : here there may industrial designer : um , the other one is quite easy , tho though . user interface : uh , though it has more functionality i think it should n't be for the user to learn it actually . it should n't be diffi marketing : okay . so maybe a three or a four . user interface : uh yeah , actually in fact i think it will be industrial designer : one me um we hope user interface : yeah industrial designer : maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . user interface : yeah but y industrial designer : and there is a like i would say three . or maybe four . marketing : okay . consensus ? three or four ? user interface : well we have reduced the keys actually you see . project manager : three , i would . three . marketing : three ? okay . industrial designer : yeah , yeah user interface : three is fine with me . industrial designer : because it 's n uh it 's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so , user interface : yeah it 's a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : it 's not so easy , like this one the normal . project manager : yeah . yes but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy . user interface : is quite easy yeah . project manager : so so i think th three is good . yeah . user interface : initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : good . marketing : so three 's project manager : what 's the next ? marketing : uh how well it goes to the target demographic . so we 're d we 're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? project manager : so twe twenty to forty , yes that 's marketing : that 's industrial designer : this one would be uh for grandmothers . project manager : user interface : oh no , this would i i would i would give this model to the old people actually . industrial designer : yeah , grandmothers , yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so sh completely changed our demographic there , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and marketing : it 's not part of the the funky young thing . project manager : well exce except for the surfing shape . i mean that 's that 's something which which has an appeal on this group i think , industrial designer : yeah that 's true . yeah . marketing : yeah . if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then i can imagine it being applying to the the demographic project manager : but industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . that 's it 's still ye project manager : mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic marketing : mm . 'cause we have got room , we 've got some budget there to add a few things to it , that 's right . project manager : but as it is now , i w would say mm , six , something . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : oh yeah , . marketing : and project manager : do you agree ? user interface : i industrial designer : yeah because it 's so important it 's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets , the right range of people , user interface : well i think industrial designer : right ? user interface : yeah . uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it 's going to be cheap , actually . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but it 's going to be cheap whatever though , user interface : so marketing : it was set with i we 've got a set price . user interface : and people can still decide to use the cheaper one industrial designer : yeah . user interface : instead of a industrial designer : but for us it 's yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five euros . project manager : mm , yeah , indeed . marketing : yeah . there 's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few euros on that one rather than another one . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : ju just think , twenty five euros , i mean it 's not going to be cheaper . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : okay . so in that case well it 's fine then . marketing : okay . um project manager : mm . mm . okay . user interface : we can yeah . marketing : and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? user interface : and the demographics of marketing : it 's got the got the the toys in it , it 's got the lcd screen project manager : yeah tha tha tha tha tha that 's marketing : and project manager : i think it 's better , because of the lcd screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the marketing : yeah . project manager : on the and on the industrial designer : yeah . and if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , i think for this audience we need absolutely the lcd screen . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm . so , the lcd screen uh attracts , marketing : yeah . i think especially if we 're gon na n have an lcd screen on a low range product then that 's good . project manager : because it mm , ma maybe that 's something to consider , yes , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm . okay . project manager : so . wh what what marketing : i 'd probably go with three again for that one . user interface : yeah i think it 's uh it has more market actually . industrial designer : or even even one and two . or two . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : no s say t two . user interface : y yeah , you know marketing : okay . so , two , yeah ? industrial designer : yeah . two yeah . user interface : yeah two yeah . because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include marketing : yeah . yep . and especially i guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , user interface : for the people to marketing : and that makes it more appealing , it 's more of a a new fun toy . user interface : we have to practically test it . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : the field test will tell you how good . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : okay , the final point , trends . marketing : and following the trends . user interface : the trends . marketing : so the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . project manager : mm . mm . marketing : so as it is , not really doing either of them . project manager : i think industrial designer : spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . marketing : well , project manager : marketing : the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : i know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but i 'm thinking one of the nokias that 's got like you ca it has n't got individual buttons industrial designer : uh okay . marketing : it 's got just a one bit on it user interface : yeah i know . marketing : and so you can that feels kinda spongy . industrial designer : but this one includes this feature , right ? spongy buttons . marketing : so it 's sort of , yeah . user interface : yeah . we we we we we yeah , it 's the way they are going to be , actually . marketing : mm . okay . industrial designer : so uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . marketing : but that 's if you 're using the covers . project manager : and the then we can al marketing : or is it just one industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yes . we can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? i mean marketing : well they make it for mobiles , it ca n't be that much more complicated . user interface : but why do you want to cover that actually ? in that uh w in the mod project manager : well just with the with the flexible plastic uh marketing : so you got the option of having different colours or different textures . industrial designer : yeah . this is possible . project manager : i th i th i think user interface : uh uh y are you sure ? yeah i think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . project manager : o o or just two things which can be put on each other . marketing : mm . industrial designer : yeah exactly like nokia phones . project manager : yes , exactly like it . uh , so maybe we can but we have to decide it , we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and s now try to invest in the in in the features ."
