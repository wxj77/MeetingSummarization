    "query": "<s> how did kirsty williams am answer sian gwenllian am 's question about quality assurance ?",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : thank you . my understanding\u2014and as i said , it 's a bit difficult , because i ca n't put myself into the thought process of the minister at the time and what his expectation was . but , certainly , my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence , it was an expectation built into the act that hefcw and estyn would work together on these matters . the act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 act , which required hefcw to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions . so , as a consequence of that approach , hefcw 's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution . so , it is complicated , and huw can help me out here if i get it wrong , but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence , that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed . huw . huw morris : i would completely agree with what the minister has said . kirsty williams am : as always . [ laughter . ] at least in public , huw ."
