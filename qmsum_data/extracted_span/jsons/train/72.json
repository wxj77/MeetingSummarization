    "answer": "phd e : so in your in in the thing that you 're doing , uh you have a vector of ones and zeros for each phone ? grad a : mm - hmm . uh , is this the class project , or ? phd e : yeah . grad a : ok . um phd e : is that what you 're grad a : right , { comment } right , right f so for every phone there is there is a um a vector of ones and zeros f uh corresponding to whether it exhibits a particular phonological feature or not . phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . and so when you do your wh i 'm what is the task for the class project ? to come up with the phones ? or to come up with these vectors to see how closely they match the phones , grad a : oh . right , um to come up with a mapping from um mfcc 's or s some feature set , um to uh w to whether there 's existence of a particular phonological feature . phd e : or ? mm - hmm . grad a : and um yeah , basically it 's to learn a mapping from from the mfcc 's to uh phonological features . is it did that answer your question ? phd e : i think so . grad a : ok . c phd e : i guess i mean , uh i 'm not sure what you what you 're what you get out of your system . do you get out a uh a vector of these ones and zeros and then try to find the closest matching phoneme to that vector , grad a : mm - hmm . oh . phd e : or ? grad a : no , no . i 'm not i 'm not planning to do any any phoneme mapping yet . just it 's it 's basically it 's it 's really simple , basically a detection of phonological features . phd e : uh - huh . grad a : yeah , phd e : i see . grad a : and um cuz the uh so king and and taylor um did this with uh recurrent neural nets , phd e : yeah . grad a : and this i their their idea was to first find a mapping from mfcc 's to uh phonological features phd e : mm - hmm ."
