    "answer": "user interface : our case design . we have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium . if we go with titanium we 're gon na be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it 's tough to shape the titanium , and uh yeah pers project manager : wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , would n't it . user interface : i think wood i marketing : it it it user interface : i i ca n't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it 's just anti-technology really , you know . project manager : okay . hmm . marketing : uh uh to me in a marketing sense it 's not it 's not relative . we can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it . user interface : right . project manager : okay . user interface : and what we may be able to do , and i think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these . um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i i think it feels a little better than the plastic . project manager : 'kay . do you get a good grip on the rubber ? yeah okay . user interface : yeah um marketing : and if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand . user interface : yeah . marketing : you do n't even need to lean down to get it . user interface : the advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we 'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape industrial designer : marketing :"
