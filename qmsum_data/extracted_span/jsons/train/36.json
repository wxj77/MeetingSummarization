    "query": "<s> what did marketing suggest when discussing the features of the new remote and why ?",
    "answer": "project manager : 'cause as you rightly said , there 's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room . marketing : yeah . project manager : and uh user interface : project manager : so a device for for all remotes . industrial designer : sorry , you go . you go . marketing : i 've okay . yeah . um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . 'cause there 's quite often lots and lots . and um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you 're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . so whereas in the past you 'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . so so i do n't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room . industrial designer : user interface : comes to your whistle . project manager : hmm . marketing : that 's that 's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but industrial designer : yeah ."
