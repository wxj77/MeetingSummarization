    "answer": "professor b : right ? so it 's not just the noise but you 're adding in fact some degradation because it 's only an approximation . um , and the second thing is which is m maybe more interesting is that , um , { comment } if you do it with whispered speech , you get this number . what if you had done analysis { comment } re - synthesis and taken the pitch as well ? alright ? so now you put the pitch in . phd d : uh - huh . professor b : what would the percentage be then ? phd d : um professor b : see , that 's the question . so , you see , if it 's if it 's if it 's , uh let 's say it 's back down to one percent again . phd d : uh - huh . professor b : that would say at least for people , having the pitch is really , really important , which would be interesting in itself . um , phd d : uh , yeah . but professor b : if i on the other hand , if it stayed up near five percent , then i 'd say `` boy , lpc n twelve is pretty crummy `` . you know ? phd d : uh - huh . professor b : so i i i 'm not sure i 'm not sure how we can conclude from this anything about that our system is close to the human performance . phd d : ye yeah . well , the point is that eh l ey the point is that , um , what i what i listened to when i re - synthesized the lp - the lpc - twelve spectrum is in a way what the system , uh , is hearing , cuz @ @ all the all the , um , excitation all the well , the excitation is is not taken into account . that 's what we do with our system . and professor b : well , you 're not doing the lpc phd d : in this case professor b : i mean , so so what if you did a phd d : well , it 's not lpc , sure , professor b : what if you did lpc - twenty ? phd d : but lpc ? professor b : twenty . right ? i mean , th the thing is lpc is not a a really great representation of speech . phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : so , all i 'm saying is that you have in addition to the w the , uh , removal of pitch , you also are doing , uh , a particular parameterization , phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : which , um , uh uh , so , let 's see , how would you do ? so , fo phd d : but that 's that 's what we do with our systems . and professor b : no . actually , we d we we do n't , because we do we do , uh , uh , mel filter bank , for instance . right ? phd d : yeah , but is it that is it that different , i mean ? professor b : um , i do n't know what mel , uh , based synthesis would sound like , but certainly the spectra are quite different . phd d : mm - hmm . phd a : could n't you t could n't you , um , test the human performance on just the original audio ? phd d : mm - hmm . this is the one percent number . professor b : yeah , it 's one percent . he 's trying to remove the pitch information phd d : mm - hmm . phd a : oh , oh . ok , phd d : mm - hmm . phd a : i see . professor b : and make it closer to what to what we 're seeing as the feature vectors . phd a : ok . so , y uh , your performance was one percent , and then when you re - synthesize with lpc - twelve it went to five . phd d : uh - huh . yeah . professor b : i mean we were we were j it it it 's a little bit still apples and oranges because we are choosing these features in order to be the best for recognition . phd d : uh - huh . professor b : and , um , i if you listen to them they still might not be very even if you made something closer to what we 're gon na i it might not sound very good . phd d : yeah . professor b : uh , and i the degradation from that might might actually make it even harder , uh , to understand than the lpc - twelve . so all i 'm saying is that the lpc - twelve puts in synthesis puts in some degradation that 's not what we 're used to hearing , phd d : uh - huh . professor b : and is , um it 's not it 's not just a question of how much information is there , as if you will always take maximum advantage of any information that 's presented to you . phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : in fact , you hear some things better than others . and so it it is n't phd a : but professor b : but , i agree that it says that , uh , the kind of information that we 're feeding it is probably , um , um , a little bit , um , minimal . there 's definitely some things that we 've thrown away . and that 's why i was saying it might be interesting if you an interesting test of this would be if you if you actually put the pitch back in . so , you just extract it from the actual speech and put it back in , and see does that is that does that make the difference ? if that if that takes it down to one percent again , then you 'd say `` ok , it 's it 's in fact having , um , not just the spectral envelope but also the also the the pitch that , uh , { comment } @ @ { comment } has the information that people can use , anyway . ``"
