    "answer": "project manager : that 's nice . then because we only have thirty minutes left , i will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it 's all possible what we wan na do . and i can tell you that we 're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros . marketing : project manager : if we see i do n't know if i 've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . i counted two batteries . but maybe we can also use one . i do n't know if it 's possible . marketing : since it rechargeable . project manager : it 's rechargeable . that 's right . user interface : yeah we can u just uh project manager : okay . that 's two euros off . user interface : 'kay . project manager : we need the advanced chip . so there 's not much to uh to save there . here we have the single curves . uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro . um , i do n't know , but i think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . user interface : yeah . project manager : i think we have to keep that . user interface : yeah . project manager : then we have the case material supplements . it 's plastic . it 's the cheapest one we need . so that 's uh not much to save either . but then the biggest costs are the buttons . so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . user interface : okay . project manager : because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end . um , user interface : yeah . project manager : so if we let 's fir first count the buttons we have now . user interface : uh sixteen , i believe so . project manager : because i sixteen . nah , that will be even more then . eighteen euros . so , user interface : uh seventeen . uh with the help button . project manager : seventeen . industrial designer : marketing : um project manager : okay , including the help ? marketing : damn . project manager : yeah . uh seventeen . user interface : yeah . project manager : i think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long . marketing : user interface : . project manager : that saves us uh one euro already . 'cause then we have got fifteen i think ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : would n't project manager : fifteen buttons . marketing : yeah . no . that would n't be an option . project manager : and this is marketing : uh , d i assume you 'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ? project manager : no those are one , i think . user interface : yeah . where did uh marketing : well , think actually there 're two buttons , user interface : uh , it 's just one button . marketing : are n't they ? user interface : but , um yeah . there were uh two uh for one big button . but they are uh more expensive than the small ones . uh , yeah . so project manager : yeah but th it 's not stated in this files . user interface : it 's just a . project manager : so maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing marketing : well i was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . project manager : that 's possibility as well . marketing : that would cut the cost . project manager : so and it 's good for the design as well . so you can make uh let 's see . if you make this looks a bit like uh a cross . plus . min . user interface : but i do n't do n't know if if it 's cheaper . project manager : uh s yeah channel . user interface : so uh , project manager : yeah w user interface : we 've still got four buttons , but just um so project manager : yeah th i think they count uh the materials . user interface : you got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um project manager : yeah on the chip there . yeah . user interface : yeah . on the chip you 've got still uh four uh four buttons . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : that 's right . that 's right . user interface : so project manager : but i think because we have the advanced chip marketing : yeah . project manager : we can just count this as one button . user interface : yeah , but marketing : but , i think this really is four buttons anyhow . project manager : but no but i think yeah . maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it 's impossible to get the twelve and a half euros . also the l_c_ display , i think it 's , i think it 's too expensive for the display we use . industrial designer : uh that 's that 's a big cost . project manager : i think they uh try t industrial designer : if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . project manager : that 's right , but what 's the big advantage of our remote then ? marketing : only the docking station , i guess . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : which is n't the the docking station is n't even in this c s schematic . so it 's not even taken into the price . project manager : that 's extra . that 's extra . that 's right . marketing : maybe we should to a different supplier . project manager : that 's an option . marketing : yeah . project manager : poland . something . polish supplier . do n't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well . industrial designer : we we could save money on it . but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ? user interface : . marketing : yeah , that 's what i 'm wondering . industrial designer : my mother ca n't even send send an s_m_s_ message . project manager : yeah . that 's a point . industrial designer : so user interface : are we gon na buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ? marketing : um user interface : so um yeah . we m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or ca n't uh go um industrial designer : yeah . marketing : well , since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it 's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . especially since we have those nice features . project manager : yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros . we do n't have any more budget to develop it . user interface : is it impossible to industrial designer : the margin will get too small . yeah . project manager : yeah . so user interface : but it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty . project manager : it is . if you leave out the l_c_ display . and if you use less buttons . say or you can take the single chip . user interface : i do n't think so . marketing : it would be a be a pretty rigid one . user interface : s yeah . marketing : user interface : but , you ca n't use uh project manager : there it is . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : but then w good looking . user interface : uh , wi with n oh , with uh attractive uh o options . project manager : yeah . user interface : so uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . so project manager : i think it 's uh difficult as well , but marketing : basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . industrial designer : no remote . project manager : or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . then w user interface : scroll-wheel 's one . industrial designer : that 's project manager : because then we save ten buttons . user interface : no , it project manager : then we have five and one . user interface : yeah . project manager : and and see . if we have this one and we 've got the advanced w uh , we 're getting close . industrial designer : we 're getting closer . user interface : yeah . marketing : but how does scroll-wheel work here ? project manager : then you will or maybe you can um scroll . if you scroll you will see the numbers on the lcd display . until you 've got the right number , then you push it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . integrated scroll-wheel push-button . project manager : alright . it 's got ta scroll and push . okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well . marketing : but yeah . industrial designer : you could just not scroll for a half a second . project manager : yeah . that 's right . so if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . industrial designer : so you wo n't need a button . marketing : i think that would be like the end of our usability . project manager : but it would definitely crop cost , a lot . user interface : d yeah . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , but project manager : and we need the battery . and the regular chip is not possible ? it has to be advanced ? industrial designer : if you want to use an lcd screen you you need an advanced chip , yes . project manager : it has to be advanced . yeah . okay . and we can save a euro by a flat design . that 's an option we can user interface : ja ja . project manager : then we 're almost there . industrial designer : yeah if you v could just leave out one more button . project manager : yeah . so if we user interface : yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah but i think that 's that is a big advantage , user interface : so yeah project manager : if we 're user interface : yeah it 's a big advantage . project manager : but user interface : but um , it 's project manager : can we use ca n't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? user interface : uh , yeah . industrial designer : i think so . yeah . project manager : if you push it three times ? marketing : well , think it 's pretty much the teletext subtitles are user interface : yeah . marketing : right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and teletext disappears . but the subtitles stay there . user interface : but if you push the teletext button twice industrial designer : what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? eight hundred eighty eight . marketing : i think that 's the case on most user interface : it 's uh one m uh one b uh , a few buttons . project manager : ah that 's not really that marketing : well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . industrial designer : yeah . okay . marketing : but then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who do n't even know what a scroll-wheel is . user interface : yeah . marketing : holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . industrial designer : marketing : with only five buttons on it . and a scroll-wheel . project manager : i think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . if you just make it real simple . because it saves it saves a lot of money . and we can keep our lcd screen , which can provide extra information . how to use the scroll wheel . how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . marketing : true . true . project manager : and it 's good for the innovative design as well . if you would erase these . mm eraser ? and we put uh looks a bit odd maybe . marketing : that 's a pretty big scroll wheel . project manager : that is something like that . marketing : project manager : then , yeah . we 've got the scroll-wheel . one , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . and these are two buttons then . industrial designer : we could make two buttons out of that . and just um if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so that would save two buttons . if you do the same for the channel . project manager : yeah . that 's really a good good idea , i think . and it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . industrial designer : more obvious . project manager : so we make one for the volume , one for the channel . plus scroll . that 's right . industrial designer : so if we project manager : so we 've got one , two , three . yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . that 's m that 's better . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . so marketing : so this is five buttons . industrial designer : if we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . and make it smaller overall . project manager : y yeah . industrial designer : so if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button project manager : mm yeah . uh yeah , and then you can industrial designer : you get a a much smaller remote . project manager : that 's right . user interface : uh yeah . industrial designer : and it sh project manager : so we can decrease this one to four buttons . industrial designer : yeah ? marketing : right now we have five . user interface : but uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . project manager : yeah . that 's no problem . user interface : just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . it uh it 's a bit uh project manager : yeah . yeah . it 's uh it 's more the moulds in which they are being made , i think . single curved is really easy to just fill in . and cases come right out of the machine . user interface : . project manager : and single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one . i think this is a really easy one . um , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? freek , what do you think ? marketing : well , i still think we should go for the single curve design . user interface : . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but then again , all these changes are not really okay with me . industrial designer : richard 's argument was very good . yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : but since we just have to . project manager : we have to cut costs . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah i 'm ag marketing : i 'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote . project manager : ask for more money . yeah . yeah . i am agreeing with the usability . yeah . marketing : or do some market research and see what the options are . project manager : yeah . but th um i think we can then keep the single curved one . just to express our lcd screen a bit more . marketing : yeah . project manager : so people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , user interface : yeah . project manager : it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . it will be necessary to have good help function , as well . so this is scroll . i think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . before we went on to the to the whole design . marketing : yes . definitely . user interface : the th project manager : but i 'm glad we could make a bit . marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one . marketing : it 's pretty different . user interface : marketing : but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . this will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . project manager : yeah . it will . yeah . user interface : but um marketing : 'cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . this is not familiar for them . project manager : no , but i think marketing : so we 're gon na have to do a lotta convincing them . project manager : i think the most user interface : but they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . project manager : that 's right . marketing : yeah . project manager : we can let l user interface : so maybe it 's uh project manager : we can stick it out , a bit . like a old old buttons . user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : maybe that 's recognisable for them as well . yeah . that 's a good one . user interface : yeah . project manager : so , i 'm afraid we have to move on . and it 's uh it 's b uh less frightening , i think . if they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh but we will see . user interface : yeah . marketing : that 's true . might uh might be confusing too . project manager : yeah . that 's definitely right . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : they 'd be like , what ? only five buttons ? project manager : yeah . user interface : but very special , so uh project manager : i would buy it . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : yeah . but you 're not sixty . project manager : that 's right . i would buy it if i was six . no i do n't know . what it costs under twelve and a half euros ? no ? uh , yes they are . industrial designer :"
