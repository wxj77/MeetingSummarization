    "query": "<s> what did kirsty williams elaborate on the immigration policy when discussing the possible official solution to the problem ?",
    "answer": "julie morgan am : has the welsh government explored the possibility of looking at different immigration rules for international and eu students who may wish to study here ? kirsty williams am : okay . well , with regard to immigration , clearly , this is something , at the moment , that is out of our hands , and i have to say , it has n't got off to a great start when initially the post-study work visas were issued just for a number of institutions in the south-east of england , with no consultation with us and i do n't believe with the scottish government either . so , we have campaigned , pushed , cajoled , lobbied , and i was very glad that in december last year , the home office did then make that scheme available to cardiff and to trinity saint david . we continue to press the point that we do not believe that , first of all , international students should be included in any immigration targets . i think all the evidence suggests that the british public do n't regard international students as immigrants , and therefore we do need to make sure that they are taken out of the targets and we can continue to press that message with the uk government . at the moment , you 'll be aware that welsh government has looked at a specific piece of work on whether there was any scope for specific immigration policy for wales , although i must say that was mostly in the field of actually the workforce rather than students . you 'll be aware that this week the government 's migration advisory committee\u2014there are so many committees these days\u2014have said that they do n't believe that there is a case for a separate provision for eu students , as opposed to international students . but we want an immigration system that makes it as easy as possible for those students who want to benefit from education in wales , and indeed the uk , to be able to do so ."
