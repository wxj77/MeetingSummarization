    "answer": "user interface : i thought a little bit about the interface . uh how it should look . and uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an lcd screen , so i had to uh look on that . and the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . and this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . and they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . and so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning joe or what 's your name . this uh and there 's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . um perhaps it 's useful , perhaps for because people um lose the remote , they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something . industrial designer : marketing : it 's true . user interface : and perhaps we could uh implement that . industrial designer : user interface : and then i have to go out of the presentation because i tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like industrial designer : oh my god . user interface : but i ca n't draw , so uh do n't make too much of it . i tried to uh the lcd screen i tried to sort of to draw . i thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . i do n't know if there is an icon for the program , but industrial designer : not just a p_ . user interface : yeah . marketing : p_ yeah , just a p_ . industrial designer : .. . user interface : and then the buttons above and uh below marketing : user interface : the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . um . marketing : where 's where 's the button for two ? user interface : i forgot that one . i thought i forgot something , marketing : okay . user interface : but uh . industrial designer : user interface : and uh and uh the numbers , that should be a bit larger i think it 's not really on scale and and so forth . marketing : does n't matter . user interface : um an options button . and i thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it 's not really options , i think . it 's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the tv and that kind of uh thing . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so could call it settings or something . but this is a bit uh how i thought it . and uh the lcd uh somewhere on the remote . perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it 's better in your hand or something uh . industrial designer : oh okay , user interface : but uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this . industrial designer : oh yeah , . user interface : and uh it 's also uh i thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people do n't really want to use uh these extra settings . and older people a also do n't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . so they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh and you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . industrial designer : mm . okay ."
