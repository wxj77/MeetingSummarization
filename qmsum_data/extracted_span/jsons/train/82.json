    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about actions towards the document in 2015- '' national model for regional working '' .",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : so , that is the current model . some work was undertaken in 2017 and 2018 to look to update that model and revise that model . some specific recommendations were put forward about additional services that could be organised on a regional basis ; primarily , that is a specialist human resources resource . we know that , because of austerity in some local authorities , hr departments have been really stretched . education hr is a specialist service , it 's not generic . it 's often a service that\u2014 . i see that as part of a school improvement service . support for governors also has been stretched within individual local authorities . so , a proposal was put forward to include specialist hr and governor support as part of the regional model . that was rejected by local government . our local authorities did not want to include that in the regional model . however , i must say , having presented that evidence , some of our local authorities , even though there was n't a national agreement to put that into the national model , have pooled their resources , and those services are being delivered and supported on a regional basis . so , for instance , the education achievement service now provide specialist hr resource , and eas and central south provide governor support . so , although we were n't successful in persuading local government to adopt a new national model , local authorities in those areas saw the value of moving that way . hefin david am : so , with that in mind , and perhaps i 'll put this to steve davies , everything the minister just said , and also the line in the document\u2014 'the implementation of this model will change over time'\u2014 is it time to go back to that document and review it from a procedural point of view ? steve davies : i do n't think it 's necessarily timely to go back and have a complete review of it . but , certainly , we are in ongoing discussions with the welsh local government association , both in terms of work with local authorities , and the type of intervention in schools . so , we keep a constant watch as to which areas that we believe we could develop further . we are not currently intending to do a wholesale review of that . as the minister touched on earlier , there is some work to get consistency across the current area , particularly , as we just mentioned , in relation to erw work . so , it 's getting a consistent approach at that level , and sharing the practice . i think what is emerging , as the minister said , is that there are two regions who have already made this shift to pool services . i think the two other regions are seeing and will see the benefits of that , and instead of forcing it through , we 'd expect that to evolve . but we 're not , at this stage , looking to a wholesale review of the national model . lynne neagle am : hefin . hefin david am : and professor dylan jones 's strategic delivery group seems to have had quite a warm welcome in the sector . is it fair to say that ? kirsty williams am : i believe so . i 'm very grateful to dylan for his hard work and his skill in chairing that group , and i think it 's been welcomed by all , so that we can get that clarity and consistency about the roles and responsibilities of the individual partners and players in the middle tier . hefin david am : and when will the work be completed , and what will the outcomes be ? kirsty williams am : well , the group is currently engaging with steve and other officials on agreeing a plan , but also , crucially , that plan is there to support the successful implementation of the curriculum , so that we 're very clear about the roles and responsibilities in the middle tier in this crucial phase following the publication . we have to move now from the publication into a relentless focus on implementation . the history of devolution is full of fantastic documents , and , shall i say , patchy implementation . the work that has gone into that curriculum is too important for implementation to be left to chance . it 's too important . it 's too good to be left to chance . so , everything now is a relentless focus on successful implementation . hefin david am : yes , but i 'm thinking that the strategic delivery is reviewing the role of the middle tier . so , you know , what do we expect to see from it , notwithstanding the kind of softly , softly approach that you 've already talked about ? steve davies : it was set up , actually , about 18 months ago\u2014just under . it was set up to build collective efficacy , because what people out there are seeing is that there 's a confusion of roles , in what the regions are doing , and it was building that collective efficacy so everyone was behind the wheel . so , they 've been looking at who is doing what for the last 18 months , and exploring and making some changes themselves . it 's not just what they do with government or what they do with each other ; it 's just happened that it 's timely , because one of the key bits of feedback we believe we will get from the organisation for economic co-operation and development is we have had co-construction , we 'd had collective effort , but we need to do more , particularly within the middle tier . this is not controlled by government , it is arm 's length from government , and it 's not their job to get it ready for the new curriculum\u2014that 's a key part of it . this group will have an ongoing role ; it 's not a task and finish group . it does feed back in to the minister but there 's no formal mechanism by which they have to report . hefin david am : okay , that 's very clear . lynne neagle am : okay . i 've got supplementaries from suzy , then si\u00e2n . suzy davies am : okay , thank you . lynne neagle am : briefly , please . suzy davies am : i think this is a really interesting evidence session . what i 'm about to say , i say it even though i 'm a big localist : it all seems to be heading in one direction of a national service . is the strategic group even thinking in these terms , obviously building in local accountability ? but it 'll just make it so much easier in terms of accountability and consistency to monitor what the middle tier does , if it 's a national service , like the national adoption service . local delivery , national service\u2014is it heading in that direction ? kirsty williams am : that 's not the intention of setting the group up . as steve just said , i receive feedback from dylan , because i meet dylan in this particular capacity on a planned basis . he is there to give me advice on the middle tier , and to give me advice on what he thinks welsh government needs to do . but i 've not had that conversation with him about a national service . suzy davies am : okay . well , thank you for that . sian gwenllian am : what i was going to raise has been answered already , that is that , from what i can see , the work that professor dylan jones is doing has evolved somewhat . i felt that , originally , the idea was to look at the middle tier in terms of any kind of duplication that was happening , and where it was possible to tighten up the people going into schools from different directions . but it appears that it has evolved to be something that 's much more than that , and that it is placing a focus on the curriculum and other aspects of the educational system . is there a risk for them to lose focus in that sense ? kirsty williams am : no , not at all . i think they are very , very clear around establishing roles and responsibilities for each of the players and to be very clear about the expectations that each part of the middle tier can have of each other , as to what they can expect from their partners in the middle tier . and absolutely , it is about making sure that there is n't duplication , that people are n't second-guessing each other 's work , and there are clear demarcations about who does what in the system , and , as i said , knowing that you can rely on your colleague in the middle tier to do the bit that they are responsible for . so , i do n't think there 's a question of it losing focus ."
