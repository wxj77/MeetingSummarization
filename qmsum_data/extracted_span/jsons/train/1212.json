    "answer": "eluned morgan am : so , if i could just make some points on fe . we 've been actively engaging with the fe sector . we 've spoken to every one of the colleges about how they see things developing . i think it 's quite a different response than what is going to be happening in he . suzy davies am : yes , because the student thing is n't such an issue , is it ? eluned morgan am : you 've got to remember that the fe colleges are much more anchored within their communities , they 're much more localised , and so , for example , the number of eu students in these colleges is significantly lower . the number of staff in these colleges\u2014i think they 've analysed that there are only about 71 people . so , we 're keeping in touch with them and we 're letting them know what we are being told in terms of the home office settled status and what we can do to protect those 71 . but that's a much bigger issue , i think , for higher education . suzy davies am : what are they telling you about european social fund funding , though , because , as you say , they 're locally anchored\u2014the impact on fe of esf funding is probably more significant than the issues we 're talking about with higher education . how are you finding this out ? is this through one-to-one conversations ? eluned morgan am : we are engaging with them all , and , obviously , we 're engaging with colegaucymru , who 've done their own analysis , and what we found , in particular , is that the real problems are probably in relation to esf funding and apprenticeships . but what you 've got to remember is that that link between apprenticeships and the local work community is absolutely crucial . so , if\u2014 suzy davies am : yes , that 's why i asked ."
