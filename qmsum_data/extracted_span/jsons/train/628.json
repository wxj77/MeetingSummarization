    "answer": "lynne neagle am : good morning , everyone , and welcome to today 's meeting of the children , young people and education committee . we 've received no apologies for absence . can i ask members whether there are any declarations of interest , please ? darren millar am : yes , i have a declaration of interest , chair . i understand that my daughter features in one of the videos that is going to be used to contribute evidence to this inquiry . and , in addition , i 'm a governor of one of the schools that features in the video . lynne neagle am : thank you , darren . so , item 2 , then , today is our first session on the provision of textbooks and learning resources for pupils , which is a video of interviews with young people and teachers . the committee team has been out to take video evidence around wales , and we 're now going to watch the results of that on the screen . okay . well , i 'm sure that the committee would want me to place on record our thanks to the young people and the teachers who took part in that very helpful and informative video . we 'll move on now then to our evidence session , and i 'm very pleased to welcome gareth pierce , chief executive of the wjec , mike ebbsworth , assistant director educational support , wjec , philip blaker , chief executive of qualifications wales , and emyr george , associate director general qualifications at qualifications wales . so , thank you all of you for attending and thank you for the papers that you provided in advance as well . if you 're happy , we 'll go straight into questions now , and if i can just start by asking you to outline what you see as your role in ensuring that students and teachers in wales have the resources that they need to pass general qualifications and what you think the role of commercial publishers and welsh government is . philip blaker : shall i start ? so , qualifications wales is the regulator of the awarding bodies , so we regulate awarding bodies . our powers are structured around the regulating of awarding bodies . we do n't regulate commercial publishers nor the provision of textbooks within that . in regulating the awarding body , our primary focus is also on the design of the qualifications and then the delivery of the assessment . so , it 's much more around the assessment side than teaching resources . that said , when we are going through the design of the qualifications , we go through an approval process , so we develop approval criteria and we ask wjec to submit their specifications against those approval criteria and sample assessment materials as well . so , our focus is very much on making sure that teachers are able , through the sample assessment materials and the specifications , to have a good understanding of what is going to be expected of them in the examinations and of their pupils in the examinations . so , that 's setting out the knowledge , skills and understandings that will be assessed by wjec when those exams are sat . we have in the past pulled together groups of people to look at issues like resources . so , during the last round of approvals , we pulled together interested parties in welsh government , regional consortia and wjec to look at resources that would be available with a view to facilitating the discussion about who would be best placed to fill the gaps where there may be perceived to be gaps in resources . our other primary role is in maintaining standards . so , as the regulator of qualifications , what we want to do is we want to make that the awards of qualifications\u2014so , the grades that people get\u2014are fair . one of the things we do is set out the way in which the awarding bodies will set grades\u2014so , the awarding process , the methods that will be used\u2014and then we monitor wjec's award of grades against those processes . during a period of change , we prescribe the use of comparable outcomes as the primary approach , largely because comparable outcomes are designed for circumstances like this , where there 's a change in a specification particularly , because there are any number of reasons , including resources , why performance may be different from one year to the next , but comparable outcomes is there to ensure that , all things being equal , if the cohorts have the same ability , the same grade should be awarded from one year to the next . we do recognise that there have been delays in textbooks . much of that has been related to the timelines that we 've all had to deliver new specifications against , which have been far from ideal for everybody involved . we think that particularly our role moving forward will be looking at the timelines for reforms that will be necessary for the new curriculum to make sure that this situation is n't repeated and that there is sufficient time in future reforms to allow for greater system readiness . in terms of the roles of others , welsh government have a role at the moment in terms of grant funding of translation of materials into welsh medium . and there is , through the common model at the moment\u2014and this is a model that is common between england and wales\u2014a reliance on commercial publishers to provide textbooks . now , that 's something that probably needs to be looked at in the future in terms of potential different models for how that might be achieved and also , potentially , around a paradigm shift in what 's expected of those materials . so , i think that sets out qualification wales 's position in particular . lynne neagle am : thank you . gareth . gareth pierce : thank you very much . the wjec does provide what 's required in a regulatory sense , and there are two things there\u2014the specification , which tends to be very comprehensive in providing guidance in terms of drawing up a programme of teaching , and also exemplar assessments , which include marking , and those go to the regulator before they are published . so , those samples go to the regulator . the wjec also do invest a great deal in resources that we produce digitally in both languages simultaneously . each new course has substantial teaching guidance , which includes a great deal of useful information for teachers and pupils . and we run a professional development programme for teachers that is free of charge when courses are new , and then annually there is some charge for those events . they are face-to-face events , or , increasingly , they are webinars . the wjec also encourages publishers to take an interest in providing textbooks . we do n't have a commercial agreement with publishers . indeed , the regulations as they stand in wales , northern ireland and england preclude examination bodies from having commercial links with providers of textbooks , but that is something that emerges from the three-nation regime that existed in terms of qualifications . so , that is one point that we noted as something that needs to be considered for wales as we move forward , whether it would be possible\u2014 . as we are not talking about examination boards competing with each other in wales for gcse and a-levels , in passing , that is something that i would want to suggest may deserve review . we encourage publishers to take an interest . at the moment , these tend to be england-based\u2014hodder education and illuminate education , for example\u2014and then the welsh government does provide funding to the wjec to support the process of providing welsh-language versions for those textbooks . so , we use that funding to provide editorial support to the process , and also to pay for translation costs , and we give significant guidance in terms of terminology . we have a language services team including excellent editors and translators within the wjec , and we work closely with external translators too , and we use translation technology increasingly , which facilitates a great many things . beyond that , i think the wjec does see the need for flexibility , particularly when difficulties arise , and you heard there of some of the methods used by mike and others to get digital resources available earlier than the print versions . and i should also note perhaps that , as the wjec is very much involved with stakeholders , we feel that we do have a contribution to make in terms of ideas for the future . lynne neagle am : thank you . we heard in the video that teachers are spending a lot of their time actually translating materials . what is your view on that as a good use of teachers ' time in wales ? gareth pierce : i think the question of translation is an interesting one . there was talk about pupils translating and teachers translating . i think perhaps we need to understand what causes the need for that because , as i mentioned earlier , there are so many resources available digitally in both languages at the same time . perhaps an interesting question is : is that source useful for teachers , being able to draw resources from two sources ? another interesting question , i think , is\u2014 . the welsh language , of course , is a language that is used in an educational context , but we are in a big world that 's an english language world . i 'm very aware that many of the websites we refer to in our resources and many of the case studies , as was mentioned in that video\u2014they are available in english only . therefore , i think another interesting question is : can we discover what those additional resources are that are worth translating ? and , certainly , it would be very unfortunate if there were a dozen welsh-medium schools , for example , translating material from the same website independently of each other . if there are a few websites , or a few case studies , in this big external digital world that are worth translating , should n't we able to source those early ? because i do n't think it 's a good use of teachers ' time . but i also think that the use of both languages is an interesting one . what is the vision in terms of teaching in a welsh-medium class , in particular , perhaps , in the a-level classes ? i 'm sure that some teachers feel that there is a way of enriching the teaching by referring to terms in both languages , as well as explaining those terms in their own language . but the impression i got from the video was that there was quite a lot of mechanical translating happening , and perhaps there is a need to understand more of the context . lynne neagle am : llyr on this . llyr gruffydd am : just to pick up on your point on the additional materials , whose role would it be to asses this or to take that overview , and then to respond to the demand ? gareth pierce : mike , in the wjec , has conversations about resources in the team he 's part of . mike ebbsworth : yes . that is extremely important\u2014to identify , as gareth has just said , those materials that need to be translated , and not everything needs to . we 've made a lot of use recently of speaking with teachers and the consortia , and ensuring then that we are focusing on those things that need that attention . llyr gruffydd am : but would you\u2014 ? the question i 'm asking is : would you still see that as a core part of your work , although it 's not necessarily essential in terms of the provision that you 're required to provide ? gareth pierce : yes , we invest substantially from the wjec budget into digital resources . so , through the types of conversations that mike mentioned , in terms of identifying needs , deciding on priorities with teachers in individual subject areas , that can provide very useful information for us in terms of prioritisation . of course , the digital packages that we create are already based on conversations with teachers . llyr gruffydd am : so , it 's already happening to a certain extent . gareth pierce : well , yes , but we could always go a step further . llyr gruffydd am : and do we need further resources for that ? gareth pierce : well , it 's an interesting question . the wjec is doing as much as we can\u2014 llyr gruffydd am : why is n't it happening to the extent that it needs to happen , then ? gareth pierce : one can always do more , of course . the wjec is trying to use its budget prudently , and most of our funding comes from payments made by schools and colleges in terms of taking assessments . so , we do have a budget , but it 's not a bottomless pit . so , we do need to make choices within the substantial budget we have in terms of the work that mike is undertaking . mike ebbsworth : there is a need to be careful as well in identifying resources and needs , and that those are suited towards the requirements . quite often a teacher\u2014and i 've been a teacher myself\u2014has this idea that there is a need to have everything . but , certainly , that 's not always the case . quite often , the focus is on different things . there has been a move towards different means of assessment over recent years , and we 've moved our resources towards that to meet the needs of teachers on how to undertake that sort of assessment . llyr gruffydd am : okay . thank you . lynne neagle am : did you want to come in on any of this ? philip blaker : i 'm just going to say one thing . teachers will want to be creative in the use of resources , and , in doing that , they 'll potentially want to adapt resources from either language . i think one of the things that we would be quite keen to try and establish moving forward is what is the common core that should by default be available bilingually , and then what sits around that that would be for schools to use creatively and adapt . and what i would n't want to see is a default position where all materials were bilingual\u2014a wide range of resources that might be created from all sorts of diverse , different channels\u2014because that may inhibit the creation of some of those materials that may be more creative , which could then be used by teachers as they see appropriate . but i think it is reasonable to expect for that core , common body of knowledge to be available bilingually by default , and for teachers not to have to spend time translating that . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you . a final question from me , then . the \u00a3500,000 funding for welsh-medium educational resource that 's in the budget for 2018-19\u2014are you able to share any information with the committee as to how that 's going to be spent ? gareth pierce : tthe wjec has some information in terms of that budget . it is a welsh government budget , and they have annual discussions with us as to what resources we are likely to be working on along with publishers , and where we would like to make a claim against that grant to pay for the editorial and translation costs that we will have incurred . now , there have been conversations recently about possible support from that grant for some research work into the use of various materials and resources , and also , although this would be a very small part , a contribution towards seminars for publishers . but that is n't a full picture of the \u00a3500,000 ; i think you would have to ask the welsh government about the exact allocation of that total fund . but there may be some flexibility . we 've just started this financial year ; i 'm sure there is some flexibility in their thinking in terms of the use of some of this resource . do you want to add anything , mike ? mike ebbsworth : certainly . we have contributed a list of publications , for example , that are ongoing , and they 're aware of that , and a percentage of that funding then will go towards ensuring that those are there through the medium of welsh . lynne neagle am : thank you . darren millar . darren millar am : this is a huge mess , is n't it ? it 's a huge mess , which is causing lots of pressure and extra work for teachers , lots of pressure and extra work for learners , and is affecting the well-being of students , at a time when they need to be mentally fit , in order to go through the general stress that learners face when they have exams coming up . we know that the problems are not confined to welsh-medium resources ; they 're also being experienced in english language resources as well , particularly in terms of the availability of textbooks . you 've both mentioned\u2014both of your organisations have mentioned that there needs to be some sort of common core of resources available for learners and teachers , and i would agree with you on that front . but is n't a textbook a pretty basic element of anybody 's toolkit for supporting a child getting through the information that they need to learn , and swot up on , in advance of exams ? gareth pierce : i think that the evidence is that different learners see their requirements differently . and i agree that a textbook is part of the picture that should be available . but i think the evidence also shows that not every young person will use them ; perhaps the teacher uses them . there is an emphasis , for example , from one pupil there , on that traditional model of revision , namely class notes and his own revision notes , but that he personally also wanted a textbook . so , certainly , the content of a textbook is going to be important , and that that 's available in some form or other . it was very interesting to know , for example , that when he was describing the traditional model of revision , he felt that he 'd had quite a lot of the content of the textbook through the classroom notes . much of that digital content , of course , corresponds to the content areas of a textbook , but it 's just in a different form . but , in general , there should be a textbook . and some of our frustration as well is that the timetables of some individual publishers do n't always get us to the point where there is a textbook available in time . that does n't happen so often in english medium , but we know about that gap in time in the welsh provision . darren millar am : well , it 's happened fairly regularly in the english-medium textbook world , has n't it ? my daughter\u2014she featured in that video\u2014has got her rs qualifications coming up , and she only had a textbook over the easter period . i mean , it's completely unacceptable . and many others in that video are also being affected . you mentioned digital resources ; not everybody 's got access to digital resources in their own homes , even , in wales . so , are n't we giving a significant disadvantage to those learners who might need the traditional 'swotting up from a textbook ' method of revision and benefit from that ? mike ebbsworth : we do ensure that those digital resources include things that the teachers can also print . most of these are resources for teachers so that the teachers can adapt them for their own use , to suit the learners who are in front of them at any given time . but certainly there are materials there . if there are activities , then those activities can be printed off and handed to pupils so that they can take them home . so , i would be sceptical about that comment . we are thinking of the totality , ultimately . gareth pierce : i think you 're right that the availability of technology is an important part of this big picture . the young people talk about websites and blogs , and we 're talking about digital resources , so being able to reach those resources , i think , is vital in wales . it 's interesting to note two contradictory remarks from the teaching associations in the letters . one praises what 's available digitally , whereas another teaching organisation sees this as more work for teachers . as mike said , we've created those resources that can be adapted . one teaching organisation says that it just creates more work , while another organisation says that the digital resource is something that's very valuable . of course , the headteacher at the end was praising the fact that , in a situation of crisis or unacceptable timetables , we have succeeded in creating some resources that will be in the textbook later , but available digitally at an early stage . but i agree with your core comment that technology is vital , and access to that , and also the content of a textbook in some form is vital as well . darren millar am : mr blaker , you would agree that a textbook should be an essential core piece of the resource pack available for each qualification . philip blaker : i think we would n't want to underplay the desirability of textbooks , recognising that different learners have different learning styles and may look to different resources . i think what i 'd like to raise is a wider concern about textbooks in their current model , which is very much around the fact that every time there 's a change in a specification , there 's a new textbook , which is designed around that specification and is endorsed by an awarding body , which is a nice model for a publisher , because every time there 's a change , there 's an opportunity for a new textbook . there are two concerns that i 'd like to raise on that . first , the focus on teaching and learning . ofsted and also estyn have raised concerns about the focus in teaching on teaching to the test as a common concern in both nations . i have a concern that having a textbook that is endorsed by the awarding body and is designed specifically around that specification may lead to some of that tendency . and also , there 's the sustainability of the model . we know that we 're about to go into another round of reforms associated with the curriculum change . that 's going to lead to another round of textbooks that may need to be focused on qualifications . i think i 'd much rather see that textbooks are seen as a curriculum resource that are broader than , perhaps , the model of endorsement and the current model of publication suggest . darren millar am : so , you do n't think that a textbook for each subject should be a core resource for pupils who are learning in advance of examinations . emyr george : i 'd just like to pick you up on that . i think a textbook for each subject is absolutely an essential part of the broad range of resources that you 'd want to see available for people to choose what they prefer , but on a subject , perhaps , rather than a specific specification , because i think there 's a tendency to conflate the two , and much of the underlying content that is assessed in one specification , or a new updated specification , will remain unchanged . it is true that there may be a different focus or emphasis , or a different style of questioning , but that can be picked up more nimbly through supplementary digital resources , for example , which can highlight that change , particularly to a teacher , so that they can shape their lesson planning around that . what we are looking at here are reformed gcses and reformed a-levels in subjects that are well-established , traditional subjects , and so whilst it is not necessarily the ideal , i think it's important to remember that there is already a good deal of pre-existing resources , including textbooks , out there in schools already . we 're not for a moment saying that that is the situation that we would want everybody to be in . i think it might be preferable if the textbook was perfectly bespoke to the course and did n't contain any extraneous material , but that perhaps is an ideal picture and i think we do need to remember that there are already many resources out there that are available to teachers and to students . darren millar am : but of course , unlike their peers in perhaps other parts of the uk , we have teachers who are having to go meticulously through some of these other resources that might be available to determine whether they 're appropriate for use in the classroom , given that the specification is different in terms of the new qualifications . can i just ask you about the disadvantage that some learners might face as a result of the lack of textbooks ? mr blaker , i note that you sought to reassure the committee in some of your opening remarks about the fact that equivalent outcomes are what you aim to achieve in discussion with the wjec in terms of the outcome of assessments , and i think that that 's a very positive thing . but , how do you differentiate between the different learning styles of individual students who are in that cohort to ensure that the disadvantage that one faces because they 're somebody who relies particularly heavily on textbook-type learning , traditional sort of swotting up for examinations , versus someone who is much more digitally aware and able to use digital resources\u2014 ? how do you make sure that it 's fair to the cohort as a whole , while still enabling some of these individuals for whom textbooks are important not to face disadvantage within that cohort ? philip blaker : the systems that are in place are very much around making sure that awarding is fair across the whole cohort . it 's very difficult\u2014in fact , it would be impossible\u2014to unpick all of the different factors that might affect performance , because you could well have a textbook that 's been available for some time , it may be somebody 's preferred leaning style to use a textbook , but did they use that textbook effectively ? you know , did they open it in revision or did they not open it in revision ? so , there are so many different factors that can affect individual performance . i think it 's impossible to unpick a particular aspect like the availability of resources . motivation would be one thing , an individual learner 's motivation in the subject . the biggest input would be the quality of teaching . i think evidence has been provided to you by the regional consortia , which we saw yesterday . they particularly wanted to stress this point i think ; that the quality of teaching is probably the most dominant and the most important factor in relation to a learner 's ultimate performance in the examination . darren millar am : i understand that , but you also understand that someone who does n't have the resources that they feel are best suited to them face some element of a greater disadvantage than others for whom , perhaps , textbooks are less important . gareth pierce : i think also , perhaps , related to that , it is important to mention digital literacy here . every young person in wales , i would hope , taking gcse or a-level , should have that digital literacy in order to source the valuable materials available\u2014that they should have those skills . then , they have the choice whether they go down the digital route , or do they do as mike suggested\u2014much of the digital material can be printed\u2014or do they then turn to textbooks , in the hope that those would be available ? that would then allow for a pupil 's personal learning choice to be reflected . it 's also important for teachers to confirm that their ways of teaching do support these alternative approaches taken by pupils . not every pupil will choose to learn or revise in exactly the same way . so , the flexibility for the pupil is very important , i think . darren millar am : i understand that , but i 've got people in my constituency who have n't even got a broadband link at home , so there 's a digital disadvantage as well . can i just ask you about the reason why this has taking so long to sort out ? it was back in 2015 that concerns were first raised about the availability of textbooks in both english and welsh for the new qualifications . we 're three years on , what on earth has been happening in the interim and why is it taking so long ? if you 've got these resources digitally , why ca n't they just be compounded into textbooks pretty straightforwardly ? gareth pierce : i think the main reason for that is that there are three series of reforms of qualifications that have happened . there were some in 2015 , other subjects in 2016 , and other subjects in 2017 . those three cycles of reform have all suffered from the short timetable that was between approving a qualification and publishers being able to start the work . perhaps an interesting comparison would be a subject being taught for the first time in 2015\u2014where that subject has reached now in terms of resources . i would hope that each one of those subjects have more available now in terms of resources , and therefore we are adding each year\u2014not textbooks but digital resources . there are more past papers available , of course . we are working on sample work at the request of teachers . so , every subject is moving on over a period of time of five to six years while that specification is being studied . but those same difficulties have , unfortunately , affected 2015 subjects and 2017 subjects , and that 's why we 're discussing the same thing in 2018 . darren millar am : so , it 's the scale of the challenge and the volume of the work ? philip blaker : i think gareth , in the evidence that he has provided to the committee previously , has said about the timeline , the schedule , for reforms . now , that 's a schedule that we inherited and was largely dominated by the schedule for reforms in england . now that we 've reached a point of divergence in gcses and a-levels , between england and wales , it gives us much more agency in the future to establish a timeline that does n't place the pressures on the system . so , gareth has quite rightly pointed out that there are three waves of reforms , but the pressures that build up in the first wave are consequential onto the next wave and the wave after that . so , the whole system has been pressured both from a regulatory perspective of the approval process , the awarding body preparing its submissions to use , and then system readiness thereafter . darren millar am : that timeline was obviously set by the welsh government . i assume that advice was given by wjec and qualifications wales and your predecessor organisation to the welsh government at that time protesting about the timescale that you were being expected to abide by . gareth pierce : yes , and similarly in england , the examination boards working in england would have provided the same advice to the government there . and , of course , the welsh government programme was associated with the reform programme in england , in particularly for those a-level subjects , where there was a strong influence from the universities across the uk in terms of what they wanted to see differently in the a-level subjects . so , england and wales have run on a very short timetable common to both countries , and i would say that every exam board and every publisher has seen this very challenging in wales and england . but our advice is that there is a real need for between 18 months and two years from completing a specification that has been approved , then being able to work with teachers on what their needs and requirements will be , thinking about what the teaching programme will be , and then starting to work with publishers and get resources available\u2014ideally , with a year of preparation then for the teacher before they start teaching . so , as they will know what resources will be available , we 'll be able to discuss the use of those resources in our professional development programmes , and then that timeline is convenient for everybody . lynne neagle am : okay . darren , i 've got to bring llyr in now . llyr gruffydd am : estyn , naht , ucac , nasuwt , wjec and qualifications wales have pointed to the way in which the government has managed the reforms that have been happening over the past few years as one of the things that has led to some of these difficulties . you mentioned the fact that they come wave upon wave . well , what about the tsunami of curriculum reform that we 're currently facing ? that is , how confident can we be that the situation wo n't deteriorate as the new curriculum is introduced\u2014rather than improve ? gareth pierce : that is a very key question , is n't it ? we have started to discuss this , specifically in particular in a forum that includes publishers in wales , with the welsh government around the table and qualifications wales around the table . i think one of the very interesting questions and important questions is : what will the nature of the information available in april 2019 be in terms of the new curriculum ? at what level of detail will it be ? to what extent will it be adapted again after april 2019 ? is it detailed enough , really , for teachers to start discussing their programmes of teaching , and that we then still have a role with publishers , even though this is for this curriculum and not for qualifications ? wjec has a tradition of publishing resources over the key stages and other key stages as well . i think there is a need to discuss the implications of the timetable as it starts to appear , because there is a need to start teaching the new curriculum in september 2022 . if we 're talking about a year of preparation , that brings us back to september 2021 . if we 're talking about working on resources available for that preparation year , we 're talking about september 2020 . so , the timetable does appear already tight , particularly if there 's something that 's not quite certain about that curriculum statement in 2019 , and that there is a lot of work to turn that into teaching programmes . so , i think it is a key question , and i ca n't be confident at the moment that this is going to work . lynne neagle am : did you want to come in , philip ? philip blaker : i think one of the big differences is it 's a tsunami we can see coming . so , young people will be assessed for the first time , assuming linear exams , in the summer 2027 , which is some way away , and , actually , given the reform process historically , this is probably the most foresight we 've seen of a big change like this . there is a big dependency on the curriculum and the curriculum being described in such a way that we can relate qualifications to that curriculum , because qualifications should relate to the curriculum rather than drive the curriculum , so we do need to see something coming out of that . i think , for us , once we 've seen the curriculum , and we 've got better sight of it , we 'll be able to plan things out . we 've already started engagement with awarding bodies over the possible supply chain for these new qualifications , and , ultimately , there 'll be a go/no-go decision that would need to be made , probably in 2023 , which would be that if the conditions do n't appear right for safe implementation , then we would make a recommendation to welsh government that these reforms are delayed in terms of the qualification , not in terms of the curriculum , for a year to allow the system to be able to catch up . so , we 're starting to plan out not only the whole of the process , but also thinking about where we might have to make key decisions . gareth pierce : just one very brief comment in that context : i think that the comment of the consortia jointly is important there . they emphasise , in the context of the curriculum , the importance of the autonomy of teachers in interpreting and providing , therefore i think we truly need to discuss that . does that suggest that there wo n't be so much need for national resources , or are those resources required to support that autonomy in any case ? we need to discuss that at an early stage and in detail , i think . llyr gruffydd am : yes , certainly , and one is concerned that that conversation is n't already happening , but , yes , okay , you 've made that point clearly . if i could return , therefore , to the commercial issue\u2014clearly , there is a shortage of providers in wales , and we are reliant on others . you suggested that the wjec may be interested in stepping up and taking some sort of role if regulations were changed . i assume that that would be something that you would be eager to see happening in terms of the change to regulation in that context . gareth pierce : yes , and we 've been part of starting that discussion amongst publishers in wales . certainly , there is interest . i think that i have n't described correctly the purpose of a seminar to encourage interest : the interest is there , but there needs to be an understanding of what the implications are of working towards that kind of timetable , what the implications are of working in two languages , what kind of business model , perhaps , would be suitable for the publishers in wales , how much certainty could be given to them that there is a period of work , because they would want to build their teams , and develop skills within those teams , and to have enough certainty that this is worth doing . and therefore , those are the sort of issues that we 're starting a discussion on , in the hope of having a discussion in june to move that forward . of course , welsh government , qualifications wales and other stakeholders are part of this discussion , not only wjec , but we 've been part of initiating that discussion . llyr gruffydd am : is this developing at the pace that you would like to see it developing ? gareth pierce : yes , i think , and there is some enthusiasm . for example , a number of publishers in wales are within an association describing itself as cwlwm cyhoeddwyr cymru . myrddin ap dafydd is chair of cwlwm at the moment , and there is enthusiasm and vision , certainly . so , there 's a wonderful opportunity , i think , for wales to interpret these possibilities swiftly and then hopefully take action on them . llyr gruffydd am : and we 're talking here not just about translating but developing resources , and the point , i think , is an important one around some of the evidence that we 've received about the importance of developing resources naturally bilingually from the very beginning , rather than having to translate something . because there have been comments that translations are clunky , difficult to follow and not\u2014i 'm not saying that they 're not fit for purpose , but certainly do n't facilitate teaching , perhaps , as easily as one would wish . gareth pierce : yes , i would agee , and that begins with the authors , does n't it ? we must have the authors\u2014 llyr gruffydd am : so , the expertise , and the same capacty with the publishers as well . gareth pierce : yes , and we do want to nurture authors within wales , particularly given that the new curriculum has to do justice to a welsh dimension within the curriculum in so many different subjects . so , we need authors who can be developed , and authors who would be willing to work with the publishers . that 's a very specific theme within one of the ideas of the seminars with publishers . llyr gruffydd am : would that market be viable without any sort of subsidy , if it were to develop bilingually ? or do we have to accept that they have to have an element of public subsidy ? gareth pierce : our view in the wjec is that subsidy will be necessary . but we could rethink the model for the subsidy , perhaps . at the moment , the subsidy is described as a subsidy for the welsh-medium version . why not rethink that and think of a subsidy for producing resources in two languages for the welsh curriculum ? and perhaps we would need a little more funding for that . but there will be organisations such as the wjec who will still be interested in contributing , because we are a charity , and within our mission is investment in various things that supports education in wales . llyr gruffydd am : but in terms of where we are now , resources have to be translated . i struggle at times to understand why it takes so much time to translate a resource . i would like to know better , perhaps , what the main barriers are in that sense . but also , how long is acceptable to wait for a translation , in your view ? mike ebbsworth : we 've done a great deal of work recently , over recent years , to ensure that that delay between having an english version and a welsh version is reduced . we are highly aware of the fact that the best-case scenario is that the welsh and the english are available simultaneously . in those terms , we 've taken huge steps forward with the publishers that we 've named this morning , so that we have discussed translation as the textbook is being produced . there is a risk there , of course . the nature of books is that the author may change his or her mind , or edit as he or she is writing . well , with that model , we would have to ensure that we approved as we moved forward , chapter by chapter perhaps , so that there would be no changes to be made from then on . at the end of the process , then , the publishers in england have agreed to hold the english version back for a period of time until the welsh version is available , and then to publish both simultaneously . unless that timetable is followed throughout the process , there are inherent risks in that process , of course , as i 've mentioned in terms of translation as we author materials , and in ensuring that that timetable is stuck to . gareth pierce : and perhaps there is a need to emphasise that the process is translation and editing as a package , and that sometimes the same amount of time goes on the editing , how the welsh works in terms of diagrams and things that are n't text necessarily\u2014pictures and so forth . so , eight weeks , i think , is the time that we 've succeeded in agreeing with the publishers so that we can turn around the welsh version in that period of time . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . darren . darren millar am : i just want to ask about this eight-week delay . so , you \u2019 re telling us , mr ebbsworth , that the wjec has agreed with hodder and illuminate that , in future , even if an english textbook is available for publication , and it \u2019 s already late , you will further delay the availability of that textbook so that it can be published on the same day as the welsh-medium textbook ? mike ebbsworth : we can only work on those books that are in the process of being developed . naturally , if something is late in english , then that timetable would be affected in terms of a decision that will ultimately have to be taken . but that 's the hope : that when new textbooks are produced in english and authored in english , we would look at that eight-week period as a turnaround . darren millar am : i understand the point that you made earlier about the chapter-by-chapter approach , which seems much more equitable . but to suggest that you will delay books that could be available for students and could be available for teachers to be able to access by two months because you have n't got the systems in place to be able to produce them on the same day , seems to be wholly inappropriate . can i ask , also , why on earth it is n't possible to produce welsh-medium textbooks first and then translate them to english on occasions ? mike ebbsworth : we 're entirely open to that and to that sort of model . darren millar am : so , why has that never ever been done ? gareth pierce : well , of course , it would happen with subjects that stem from wales , but i think the problem is that we work with publishers and those publishers and their authors , therefore , tend to work through the medium of english . but , just to be clear , this idea of delaying an english version is something that the welsh government is eager for us to experiment with , but not with textbooks that are already late . they are within the new programme of textbooks that are contained within the grant that you mentioned of \u00a3500,000 . so , in a way , this is an experiment and the welsh government wants to look at this as one way of responding to the complaint that there are different timetables available . darren millar am : so , you 're being forced to do this by the welsh government , rather than\u2014 gareth pierce : well , we 've agreed to do it in discussion with them . darren millar am : so , are you happy with that approach ? gareth pierce : well , as long as the textbook is n't late in the first place , then yes ; it 's worth trying . there is a challenge on the eight weeks , there is a challenge in the publisher sticking to the timetable in terms of the english version first of all , but we are willing to use this as a test bed , and we 're working on two specific textbooks on this . lynne neagle am : i think the committee is struggling with this idea , so what do you understand to be the rationale behind that , then ? is it that both sets of pupils should be equally disadvantaged ? gareth pierce : well , no , in a way , it uses the same principle as we have regarding our use of digital resources . with the digital materials , the intention is that things are available in time and that they 're available in both languages at the same time . so , trying to imitate that with printed text is what we 're trying to do , but not with texts that are already late . so , if these books keep to the timetable , then they will be available in time in both languages , but that the english version has stayed before going out on the shelves . llyr gruffydd am : so , that 's to say that the english version will be completed eight weeks beforehand so that you have eight weeks for translation . mike ebbsworth : well , ultimately , i may have used the wrong words in saying that we 're holding the english back . the english version would still be in the process , just as the welsh version would be , and then they would catch up as they approach the date for publication and printing . there is an element of editing the english as well as the welsh and that would happen in that eight-week period . so , a draft form might be available , and we do ensure that our draft versions are available on our secure website as soon as possible , but then that has to be held up before publication . lynne neagle am : thank you . john . john griffiths am : just on that , chair , it 's nonetheless the case , as we 've heard , i think , and as the letter to the committee from kirsty williams has made clear , that there might be a situation where the english-language version of a textbook could be made available , but it is n't made available because there is n't a welsh-language version . and , as the chair said , is that about putting those students in wales on the same footing , and if so , how does that relate to the fact that these students , including those who could have had earlier access to the english-language version , are competing with students over the border , as we heard on the video earlier , for those precious university places ? does n't it place the english-language student using the english-language version at a potential disadvantage , compared to students over the border ? gareth pierce : i think this is a point for qualifications wales to a certain extent , but applicants for qualifications in wales are assessed as a national cohort , if truth be told , so , each piece of information we have on the standards is evaluated for that national cohort . the standards stem from the three-nation system . so , in discussion with qualifications wales , we ensure that there is no disadvantage to any cohort in wales in any subject , be that because of a textbook being unavailable or for any other reason . philip blaker : certainly , from a comparable outcomes perspective , the fewer differences that there are that are differential\u2014 . so , the idea of textbooks being available in english and welsh at different times could potentially create another dimension in terms of disparity . so , if we 're looking at it strictly speaking from a comparable outcomes perspective , it makes the awarding easier if everybody 's on a common playing field . it 's worth remembering\u2014we provided some evidence in our original letter particularly looking at religious studies on the basis that religious studies was a subject that had been mentioned . this subject has already been awarded at as-level last year , so it has gone through an award and will go through the full a-level award this year . the comparable outcomes approach did protect those learners last year , in the absence of a textbook , and we saw stability in the results that came out of the cohort level . similarly , with other subjects that have gone through reforms , we 've seen it with the gcses that were awarded last year , ass that were awarded last year and a-levels that were awarded last year : we saw good comparability year on year . lynne neagle am : go on then , darren . is that okay , john ? darren millar am : just a very brief follow-up on that , at the cohort level , yes , you suggest that there is some evidence that students were protected , but what you do n't know and ca n't tell , because you 're not able to drill down to the individual student level , is whether children , young people , were disadvantaged as a result of their learning style being more textbook orientated than that of their peers . philip blaker : i guess we 're in a situation where there 's no evidence either way that that\u2014 darren millar am : the absence of evidence does n't mean that it did n't happen . philip blaker : no , but there is no evidence to suggest that . we have no positive evidence to suggest that . darren millar am : well , i think you 've seen plenty of evidence about the stress that it 's causing , and the concern that learners have about their outcomes . i think it would be very interesting , actually , to take some teacher assessments and expected grades and compare those to the actual grade outcomes . is that something that qualifications wales could do on a sample basis ? philip blaker : historically , that sort of evidence has been very unreliable . gareth would probably have a stronger view on that than me . predicted grades used to be provided . certainly , back in my day at an awarding body they were provided , and there tended to be a very low correlation between the predicted grade and the actual achieved grade . i do n't know if you 've got anything on that , gareth . gareth pierce : no , we agree with you that the comparisons are not that reliable , because there are so many factors . but i think , at the end of the day , what we see is , yes , i agree there is evidence of stress , but i think there 's also evidence of young people and their teachers really using the available resources and the available skills in approaching revision and preparation , and tending to do that very well . that 's the evidence that we 've got , for example , in the as religious studies last year , that the cohort did extremely well in fact . we ca n't disagree that there 's evidence of stress , but i think we can also point towards resilience and excellent approaches to drawing together the various sources that they 've got : classroom notes , revision notes , as they mentioned , and the various other materials that they referred to . lynne neagle am : okay . john . john griffiths am : coming back to the effect of the lack of resources , we heard on the video , as you 've just mentioned , gareth , that pupils were experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety , and it affected their well-being in terms of their perception that they might be disadvantaged by the lack of resources , as we discussed . we know exam time is very , very stressful\u2014i 'm sure all of us would agree with that\u2014in general , without any additional problems or perceptions of problems . so , with that sort of background , would you accept then that some students have been negatively affected by the lack of suitable support materials for general qualifications ? i know we 've discussed this in terms of it being difficult , perhaps , to show cause and effect , but i think most people watching that video would clearly come to the view that some students have been negatively impacted . would you accept that ? gareth pierce : i 'd have to agree . there is evidence of their concern , is n't there ? but as philip said , what we do n't have is evidence that that anxiety then has an impact on their attainment , because there are so many factors , there are so many different kinds of resources that they 've referred to\u2014even those who want to see textbooks , they 're also talking about so many other materials that are available to them . of course , it 's also clear that they are conscientious young people who have worked hard , so you have a picture there of young people who are concerned , yes , and as you 've said , examinations are a stressful time in general , but they are also young people who are doing their level best , and usually do get the results that they have worked for . that 's the evidence that we have : the results tend to be achieved . john griffiths am : okay . coming back again to matters that we 've already discussed , but just to put to you in a fairly focused way , would you accept that it is n't fair that some pupils are not having the support material that others are having , depending on whether their particular subject is involved and the language that they 're studying through ? would you accept that that is a basic unfairness in the system as it currently exists ? gareth pierce : ideally , resources , digital accessibility and digital literacy should be available for every pupil on an equal basis . but i think perhaps if we analysed this in much detail , different individuals would be able to say , 'there are different types of unfairness . ' you referred earlier to the digital inequalities . is there an economic inequality ? there is some evidence from the teaching unions that suggests that not every school is in the same situation as each other in terms of buying the resources that are available . so , i think your question drives at a very important point : what sort of inequality could be having an impact on young people in terms of their achievement during their school time ? ideally , each one of those elements of potential inequality should be levelled . so , i do n't think i can go any further than acknowledging that any inequality is unfair , but there are so many different kinds and the textbook is not the only one , and therefore we 're not going to be able to analyse the impact of that on its own . john griffiths am : could i put to you , finally then , what estyn have said about reported delays in the production and distribution of educational resources such as textbooks , marking criteria and specimen papers , that that delay has impeded the ability of teachers to plan adequately , and that this effect on their ability to plan adequately is very likely to have had an impact on pupils ' achievement ? would you accept that ? gareth pierce : it 's interesting\u2014they link three quite different things there , do n't they ? we 've discussed the textbooks in some detail . when they refer to sample assessments , we have to provide those within the regulatory time frame , and they have to be approved . so , in every subject there are sample assessments and marking schemes , and they are statutorily available , in a way . when they talk about exemplars , there are different interpretations of that . one request that we receive often from schools is for exemplars in terms of the work of pupils that has been assessed and marked by us . of course , they 're not available until the young people have taken those exams for the very first time . we can make them available digitally , and through various other methods . but in some subjects the demand has been so strong that we have worked with schools in order to ensure that work is produced by pupils before that first examination , is marked by us , and is then made available . so , we can respond to that demand when it arises . i would like to have a conversation with estyn , indeed , to interpret on a more detailed level some of the things that they refer to . emyr george : may i offer a comment on that quote from estyn ? they talk about a reduction in attainment and that , to some extent , brings us back to the point in terms of the comparable outcomes method that we 're talking about . that method is based on research and evidence that says that in a period of change to an exam or qualification , we know that performance in an exam can fall , and that is due to a number of different factors . teachers are n't as familiar with the specification and the requirements of the exam . there are fewer past assessment resources available ; there are n't any past papers , for example . certainly , knowing that you 're the first to sit that exam perhaps raises your concerns about that examination , and examinations are a matter of concern already . it 's very difficult , if not impossible , to differentiate between those factors , but what we know on the whole is that they come together to have an impact on pupils ' performance in an exam , and that 's why , when it comes to awarding qualifications for the first time and looking at the grades , we look very carefully at what that the mark means in terms of the grade in order to try as best as we can , on the level of the whole national cohort , to eliminate as much unfairness as possible because they are the first cohort to sit the exam . gareth pierce : could i just make a brief comment on the sample assessments ? now , interestingly , when the english , welsh , maths , and maths and numeracy gcses were new , the welsh government were very eager that we invest in more sample assessment materials . we had to produce one for the regulator , but they wanted to see us produce far more , and we did that . but there are risks inherent in that , too . if we create more and more sample assessments , then does that create more risk of teaching to the test ? and every time we produce one of these , of course , we are using robust assessment ideas , and they 're out there to be used for test purposes . so , we need to be careful that we do n't weaken the real assessment by providing too many of the examiners ' good ideas in the sample material . so , it 's an interesting theme , but it would be interesting to have a further conversation with estyn on that . philip blaker : i just wanted to say , looking towards\u2014 . reforms always throw up issues like this . it 's almost an inevitability of any change that there will be impact . i think what we need to do is we need to think about the future reforms , particularly knowing that we 've got some on the radar already , and to think about what this paradigm is and how we can isolate some of these factors in the future . so , if we look at resources and if we look particularly at textbooks as being a curriculum resource , rather than a qualification resource , i think we can change the timeline to which some of those materials are produced . so , going back to when i studied my a-levels in the 1980s , there was this common body of knowledge that was an a-level textbook in biology that was n't focused around an individual awarding body . when we talked to unions about this on monday , they said , 'yes , when we used to teach many years ago , there were curriculum resources like that , and then when a particular topic or a particular area of content dropped out of the qualification , we either did or did n't teach it according to whether it was in the curriculum ' . that 's a little bit worrying by virtue of the fact there might have been a component of that subject that did n't get taught because it was no longer in the text , despite the fact that it was in the common body of knowledge . but i think if we can shift this paradigm\u2014and i would really like to a shift in the paradigm for resources particularly , away from the focus on the qualification and into more of a focus on the curriculum\u2014then that provides an opportunity for , i would suggest , a much healthier model in the future . there are various ways of doing that . in the united states , for example , there are some states within the united states that produce a state textbook . now , that can have issues , particularly if it 's politically orientated\u2014so , if politicians are seen to have a strong influence in the content that 's taught . but if there is independence in that state model , then i think that can be quite strong model . equally , if you look at somewhere like hong kong , they 've actually tried to de-emphasise textbooks . so , hong kong , which is a very high-performing jurisdiction , is trying to move away from that model in the future . gareth pierce : could i just add very , very briefly\u2014 lynne neagle am : very briefly , because i want to bring hefin in . gareth pierce : i know that , in our letter to you , we emphasised that this is not just to do with the body of knowledge . the assessment objectives have shifted in many subjects towards analysis and evaluation . so , therefore , we really do need resources that support that way of working , and i 'm sure that lots of the young people we 've heard from\u2014what they 're really doing in their revision is actually not just studying the content , but thinking about how they respond analytically and evaluatively . in fact , an interesting question for us as an awarding body to debate with the qualifications regulator , maybe , is whether some of the content should actually be able to be taken into the assessment hall . do young people need to remember all these terms and their precise definitions , sometimes in both languages if they 've learnt it in that way ? should n't some of the reference material be more and more available in the assessment arena ? and then you are really getting towards analysis and interpretation and evaluation . lynne neagle am : thank you . hefin . hefin david am : i want to welcome these particular comments , because having come from a higher education background , what i 've tried to deliver in my courses are textbook-free modules , where you 're relying on academic journal articles and you 're piecing together the story yourself , based on the curriculum you develop yourself . so , curriculum-focused resources are very welcome . i fear that students who are nurtured on a textbook diet , when they go to university , they are not expected to repeat what 's in the textbook ; they 're expected to do exactly as gareth says and analyse and combine information into a discursive argument . so , therefore , i 'm interested to know how you 've worked with higher education to develop that approach . i also welcome what you 've just said too . lynne neagle am : can i ask for brief answers , please ? gareth pierce : yes , well some of the people who provide ideas into our digital resources certainly are either teachers who are very well aware of that progression to he and therefore what their learners want or , in some cases , they are he people themselves . we do draw on a body of expertise , and we are more than willing to emphasise the importance of that approach to the support resources we provide . hefin david am : i think the difficulty and the difference is that , at he level , the kind of journal articles that are available are probably not consumable at gcse level . that 's part of the problem you have with that approach . gareth pierce : yes . and i think , interestingly\u2014i know we 've pointed towards some of our religious studies resources as examples\u2014i think some of the websites we point to are quite ambitious . they would be described as scholarly , and i think some of the young people on the video made that point , did n't they\u2014that they need to engage with that material to understand some themes ? but we need to assist them in doing so . we need to almost make those scholarly items that are worth including in their curriculum accessible and user friendly for them at their point of learning . lynne neagle am : philip . philip blaker : it was just one point . we recently published a report on the welsh baccalaureate and skills challenge certificate , and i think it 's relevant to pull in at this point that the independent study that pupils would be expected to do through the skills challenge certificate in doing their project work is really designed to try and draw out some of those skills that would be relevant in higher education . through the reforms that we are starting to think about for the skills challenge certificate , there 's a real opportunity to start honing some of those skills , particularly at the advanced level bacc , to make people really he-ready so that they 're better able to engage with that different style of learning . so , i think there 's a huge opportunity that should n't be diminished within the advanced welsh bacc . lynne neagle am : thank you . last questions from mark then . mark reckless am : gareth , can i just put to you\u2014 ? on the estyn criticism , i think you 've answered one aspect of their criticism that wjec did not make as many sample assessment materials available as schools would have liked early on in the reform process , and i understand your position there , but they went on and said , 'at times the sample assessment materials were provided with incorrect mark schemes ' and also , 'it would be helpful if the wjec ensure that all necessary resources were made available before the start date of each qualification . ' do you have a response to those points ? gareth pierce : again , probably , i 'd like a conversation with them about any problems with the specimen assessments and their mark schemes , because if they are the statutory regulatory ones they would have gone through philip 's team as well or his welsh government predecessors as regulators , depending on which qualifications they were . obviously , we need to be spot-on with those . very occasionally , somebody will identify an error , and obviously we then correct them , because these are available digitally online . so , if there is a problem , we want to hear about it and then we can correct it . but , yes , i agree with their fundamental premise , that ideally the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts , including , as we mentioned earlier , so we can draw on that set of resources in the events we run as wjec free of charge for teachers leading up to the first teaching . we need that information ourselves as well so we can talk about the use of these valuable resources in an appropriate pedagogical context in that preparatory year . so , the ideal is that everything is there 12 months ahead . mark reckless am : so , what mechanism do you have for picking up on this type of criticisms from estyn and having that conversation with them ? has that not happened ? gareth pierce : we have met with estyn a couple of times recently , actually\u2014once when they were beginning their review of the key stage 4 qualifications that had been in place for two years and a bit , and also when they were planning a review of some of the a-level work . because we do have regular meetings with them , we will have an opportunity to explore their comments here i 'm sure . mark reckless am : looking at the structure and the relationship between qualifications wales and the wjec\u2014 . i understand in the model in england\u2014you 've got ofqual , the regulator , and you have various competing exam boards , some i think with for-profit motivation . we do n't have that in wales ; there is a sole regulator and a single , dominant examination board . does that mean that there 's significant overlap and potentially cost duplication between the work of the two bodies , particularly given wjec is a charity and seems to have many of the same objectives as you in qualifications wales have ? philip blaker : the roles are very distinct , so i 'd tell you there's no overlap . what we try and do is try and make sure that there 's a good connection between the work that we do . wjec has very clear responsibilities around the delivery of qualifications . we have a role in monitoring to ensure that those qualifications are delivered securely and fairly . i would say a strength of the welsh model is that there is an independent regulator and a single awarding body largely , because much of the work that ofqual would need to do in terms of its maintenance of standards is about ensuring that the competition between awarding bodies does n't lead to what 's been termed in the past as a race to the bottom in terms of standards . now , the opportunity that we have in wales is , where we have a single awarding body , we can have a close and good working relationship with wjec , but guarding very strongly to make sure that we keep that regulatory distance to make sure that we preserve our role as the regulator and look at wjec as one of our regulated bodies . gareth pierce : can i make a general point ? perhaps the important opportunity in wales is to look anew at how national and regional organisations , such as the consortia , can collaborate to make a success of the broad range of resources and cpd that will be required to support the new curriculum , and also the next set of qualifications that will be reformed . we 've referred to many organisations today , but there are others . the welsh books council , for example , is part of this discussion . the learned society of wales is a player that wants to introduce ideas into the welsh dimension of the curriculum . there was mention of the he sector earlier . teachers ' associations have very specific comments to make on some of these areas . there is a great opportunity for us to come together and to have a national approach . there will be a need for some financial resource from the welsh government\u2014yes , certainly\u2014and the wjec can provide some resources , but i think we all want to collaborate in order to ensure the success of the next round of resources . mark reckless am : but does n't that national approach and collaboration preclude the model that philip was talking about earlier , where we had textbooks based on the curriculum , and there 's that core , but that was separate from what the exam body decided to do and the textbook was n't there for the particular exam approach ? if you have a single , dominant exam board , and you have a welsh curriculum that 's developed with that board , how do you then have this separation between textbook and exam ? philip blaker : so , if we look at qualification , a qualification should be based on the curriculum that 's being offered , because learning should be based around the curriculum , and the role of the qualification is to measure attainment against knowledge of that curriculum\u2014knowledge , skills and understanding , the dispositions that that curriculum is trying to develop . so , i think there are two very distinct things . now , of course , what will inevitably happen is once the curriculum is known and developed , there will be a level of detail that comes across from what the qualification is looking for . i think what we 're trying to say is , from an educational perspective , what we 'd like to see is a broader focus on the curriculum and less of a narrow focus on the qualification and some of the problems that that can drive , so that , if a learner is well-versed in the curriculum and has been taught well and has acquired the knowledge , skills and dispositions that the curriculum is trying to create , they should succeed in the qualification . mark reckless am : and you suggested earlier that , if need be , the qualification could be pushed back a year , but not the curriculum . does that mean that it would be possible to teach the new curriculum while keeping the old qualification ? philip blaker : it would be possible . mark reckless am : but satisfactory ? philip blaker : because , if we 're looking at qualifications predominantly being 14 to 16 , what professor donaldson said at the very beginning , with 'successful futures ' , was , actually , if the curriculum is preparing people better for that qualification stage , so that they 're better versed as learners and better able to perform in those qualifications and we see a rise of attainment\u2014 . ideally , you 'd be in a position where you 've got gcses that have been reformed to marry up to any change , but i do n't see there being a huge problem in itself of a delay if we think that is the right thing to do . clearly , we consider that to be a sub-optimal thing . we would much rather be in a position of having reforms , but , equally , i 'd want to see any reforms delivered safely , and i would n't want to compromise fairness and safety of delivery of those qualifications on the basis of a timeline . but i think all too often the case is that a timeline dominates over doing what is the right thing and i think as we get further into this we 'll have to really assess and keep a grip of what 's the right thing to do . mark reckless am : thank you . lynne neagle am : very briefly , darren . darren millar am : just on this issue of shaping the curriculum and making sure that we 've got textbooks that can be used to support the delivery of the curriculum\u2014 . so , obviously , the wjec 's interested in the examinations and the qualifications . that 's your role as well in terms of qualifications wales . so , who should be responsible for developing these curriculum resources ? philip blaker : i think , for a new model , that needs to be determined . welsh government has a role in curriculum at the moment . they have responsibility for curriclum and they 've already started work with the seminar last year , and then drawing people together now to look at a new model for the future . i think we need to evolve that approach , and i think welsh government taking a lead on some of this thinking about how things might be prepared for the future is probably a good position to be in at the moment . darren millar am : are there any other models that you can point us to in terms of how these things are done elsewhere ? philip blaker : yes , there are models where you can have\u2014 . for example , in northern ireland , you have the regulator , the awarding body and the curriculum body all under one roof . so , you can have a position where everything is tied together as it is in northern ireland with the council for the curriculum , examinations and assessment . equally , if you look at somewhere like hong kong , you have very distinct bodies that are looking after each individual component . so , there are lots of different models that can be developed . but , of course , in wales , and also previously in england , the qualifications regulator has also had a responsibility for curriculum . so , there has been that model in the past in wales . gareth pierce : just very briefly . lynne neagle am : really quickly , please . gareth pierce : just one thing very briefly , in terms of the wjec . i mentioned earlier that , in the past , the wjec has produced a fair few resources in collaboration with publishers in key stage 3 and even at primary stages . certainly , key stage 3 is closely linked to gcse , and , therefore , if the wjec continues to be a player\u2014as i hope it will\u2014in the area of resources for gcse and a-level , then the wjec is also well positioned in terms of our investment in editing , translating and the use of technology to contribute to key stage 3 most certainly and perhaps even the primary stages . so , i 'm sure that the wjec would want to offer itself as a national organisation that wants to contribute as best we can in this area . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you very much . well , we 're out of time , so can i thank you very much for attending this morning and for answering all our questions ? i think it 's been a very useful and informative session . as usual , you 'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy , following the meeting . but thank you very much , again , for your attendance . gareth pierce : thank you very much ."
