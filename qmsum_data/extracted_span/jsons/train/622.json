    "answer": "project manager : cheers . hardly what i 'd call the best drawing in the world but it 'll do for now . also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they 're very independent , they 're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . right . i think we 've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . project finance . as you can see , twelve point five euros per unit . that 's not a terrible lot as far as i 'm aware , and we 're hoping to sell them for twenty five . if we 're aiming for fifty million euros we 're gon na have to be selling an awful lot of them . marketing : oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that 's the amount made , okay . project manager : well , fifty million , and if you 're making twelve point five euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . so i 'm gon na guess that we 've all used remote controls . any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? user interface : well , one thing i 'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there 's there 's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen lcd remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um i mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it 's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the tv to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the v_c_r_ and get it to play once it 's rewound , for instance . project manager : okay . user interface : um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . and therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . project manager : okay , yeah , tha that 's true , with the price range we 're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our user interface : absolutely prohibitive , project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : but you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . user interface : yeah , i mean i would n't like to say you g i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros . project manager : would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the tv , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of user interface : for instance , um let 's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the d_v_d_ player and it turns the tv on and onto the right channel as well , um project manager : okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . um any takes on this ? marketing : well um i 've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , um when i was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . project manager : okay . marketing : so perhaps one that was more um specialised for game playing or interactive television . they they 've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , project manager : okay . marketing : and slide another bar to say what time it ends , you know that 's project manager : yeah i 've heard i 've seen the bar-code design before , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , it 's it 's taken out the y you do n't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . i think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . project manager : marketing : uh , you wan na be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that . project manager : okay , well"
