    "answer": "lynne neagle am : and you 've got a structured programme , have you , to roll that out ? okay . thank you . we 've got some questions now on leadership , and the first questions are from si\u00e2n gwenllian . sian gwenllian am : good morning . i 'll be speaking in welsh . the minister for health said yesterday , in answering a question from me on the chamber floor , that you gave him advice not to have a target in terms of reducing obesity among children . could you confirm that that 's what your advice was and tell us why you do n't think that a target is needed ? dr frank atherton : my advice was not that we do n't need a target\u2014we may well need a target , and that 's one of the issues we need to consult on\u2014but that the target that had been adopted in england and in scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable , and that if we are to choose a target in wales , then we need to balance deliverability with challenge . we need a challenging environment . so , there is something about performance management , because i would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they 're delivering on this , and i think we can use targets to that . but they are one tool in the box that i would think we could use , and part of the consultation is to ask that question\u2014'if we are to go down a route in wales of choosing a target , what might that look like ? ' sian gwenllian am : okay . so , to be clear , you 're not ruling out that maybe we would need a target . dr frank atherton : it 's certainly something that we could consider in terms of the final strategy . sian gwenllian am : and is that your opinion too ? okay . well , that is contrary to what i was told yesterday on the floor of the chamber by the minister , but there we go . i 'm glad to hear that you 're not ruling out having a target , because without a target , without something to aim for , how do we know that we 're getting there ?"
