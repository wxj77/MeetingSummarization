    "answer": "lynne neagle am : good morning , everyone , and welcome to the children , young people and education committee . we 've received apologies for absence from janet finch-saunders . i 'd like to take this opportunity to welcome suzy davies to the committee , and to thank mark reckless and darren millar , who have left us , for their service and hard work as members of the committee . can i ask whether there are any declarations of interest , please ? no . okay . we will move on then to our evidence session on our inquiry into the impact of brexit on higher and further education . i 'm very pleased to welcome kirsty williams , cabinet secretary for education , and eluned morgan am , minister for welsh language and lifelong learning . can i just ask you to introduce your officials for the record , please ? kirsty williams am : bore da , lynne , and thank you for the invitation to join you . eluned and i are joined this morning by huw morris , who 's the group director at shell\u2014skills , higher education and lifelong learning\u2014and marie knox , who is deputy director , overseeing european transition . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you very much , and thank you for coming . we 'll go straight into questions , then , and the first questions are from suzy davies . suzy davies am : thank you . i 'd like to ask you both , if that 's okay , a little bit about preparedness . but if i could start with higher education , i understand that\u2014i do n't know , it must be about 18 months ago now\u2014ken skates told another committee in this place that there had been nine sector analyses done . presumably , one of those was he , because of the\u2014well , welsh government had a presence , and still does , in brussels , related to higher education . apparently , those have now been superseded by work that 's been done by cardiff university . i do n't know if you 've got any comments on that research , or whether it 's been brought to your attention yet . kirsty williams am : well , suzy , following the vote , i was very keen that we work very closely with colleagues in higher education and further education , to get an understanding from on the ground about the potential impact . so , in terms of preparedness , we started that group in the september , and that work from that group , which includes both he and fe , has been instrumental in helping the government form its views , which were articulated in the government 's white paper , 'securing wales ' future ' . there has been ongoing work being done\u2014as the debate in london and europe becomes a little bit more clear , then it becomes a little less clear , and then a little bit more clear , but , bearing in mind the difficulties of working in an ever-changing field , we have been refining those approaches . each institution has been looking at their own institution , because , as you can imagine , although we have an overview of the sector , the challenges are very different for individual institutions\u2014so their exposure , for instance , to the number of european union students that they have at their college , or the work that they might be doing with horizon 2020 , or their success\u2014and there has been considerable success in the he field in securing structural funds for various projects\u2014the exposure and the potential impact of leaving the eu , in a 'no deal ' or in a 'deal ' scenario , is very , very different . but i do n't know if , huw , you want to talk any further . suzy davies am : maybe just to use the 'no deal ' scenario is probably the easiest , is n't it ? kirsty williams am : the 'no deal ' ? suzy davies am : well , yes , because that 's the worst-case scenario , so let 's look at that one . huw morris : as the cabinet secretary mentioned , the higher education brexit working group's been meeting since september 2016 and has been looking at that in general . more recently , when the prospect of no deal became talked about , officials have been visiting individual institutions to talk to them about their preparedness for that . as you 'll be aware , the funding for much of the activity is secured , we believe , even under a 'no deal ' scenario , until december 2020 ; that 's a letter we had from the chief secretary to the treasury . i think the research you 're referring to may be research that cardiff university has been doing with the bevan foundation and others . i know there 's a report due to be launched later today . we have been doing our own research and looking at the impact on he , fe and apprenticeship providers . suzy davies am : well , that 's really helpful because my understanding was that this cardiff university research had superseded all those nine sector analyses . huw morris : that may be true for the economy brief . certainly , there are published papers by max munday and a team at cardiff university on the impact of brexit on the welsh economy , but for he and fe and apprenticeship provision , it 's as the cabinet secretary outlined . suzy davies am : so , are there any formal risk assessments that are available for us to scrutinise , for example ? for he and fe for that matter . kirsty williams am : well , the higher education funding council for wales have been doing some specific work ; i ca n't comment on how wide they would want that to be shared . we have been doing some broad analysis , as i said , for the sector , looking at what we can do to mitigate the risk , bearing in mind that each institution is an autonomous institution , a principle that they guard really jealously , and rightly so . so , we have been , as huw said , because the prospect of a 'no deal ' has become , perhaps , more to the forefront , officers have been visiting each institution to try and make sure and to satisfy us , as people who fund part of their activity , that they have their own plans in place to deal with these scenarios . we continue to work alongside them to push the issues that we can help them with . so , for instance , we continue to work with officials in westminster around erasmus+ provision in a 'no deal ' scenario , what a uk stand-alone project would look like , the impacts of a 'no deal ' on horizon 2020 . so , we look at the broader picture and we are encouraging continually individual institutions to make sure that they themselves are looking at their specific needs within that . suzy davies am : well , if there is something that 's shareable , i 'm sure we 'd be very pleased to see it\u2014 kirsty williams am : anything that we 've got\u2014 suzy davies am : \u2014particularly with fe , actually , because , of course , we have n't got a hefcw for fe ; you 're doing that regulation yourself . i 'd expect to see that type of work evidenced somewhere from within welsh government , and we would be able to see that then . eluned morgan am : so , if i could just make some points on fe . we 've been actively engaging with the fe sector . we 've spoken to every one of the colleges about how they see things developing . i think it 's quite a different response than what is going to be happening in he . suzy davies am : yes , because the student thing is n't such an issue , is it ? eluned morgan am : you 've got to remember that the fe colleges are much more anchored within their communities , they 're much more localised , and so , for example , the number of eu students in these colleges is significantly lower . the number of staff in these colleges\u2014i think they 've analysed that there are only about 71 people . so , we 're keeping in touch with them and we 're letting them know what we are being told in terms of the home office settled status and what we can do to protect those 71 . but that's a much bigger issue , i think , for higher education . suzy davies am : what are they telling you about european social fund funding , though , because , as you say , they 're locally anchored\u2014the impact on fe of esf funding is probably more significant than the issues we 're talking about with higher education . how are you finding this out ? is this through one-to-one conversations ? eluned morgan am : we are engaging with them all , and , obviously , we 're engaging with colegaucymru , who 've done their own analysis , and what we found , in particular , is that the real problems are probably in relation to esf funding and apprenticeships . but what you 've got to remember is that that link between apprenticeships and the local work community is absolutely crucial . so , if\u2014 suzy davies am : yes , that 's why i asked . eluned morgan am : \u2014the economy nosedives , or if there 's an issue that we see\u2014just the dislocation of companies in those areas as a result of brexit\u2014then that will inevitably have an impact on the number of apprenticeships that will be on offer . so , it 's those kinds of things , but at the moment i think it 's worth pointing out that about \u00a315 million a year goes into the fe sector just in relation to apprenticeships . suzy davies am : can i just come back finally on that , before handing over ? in both your areas of responsibility , there 's going to be an impact on welsh government in how it responds to that , as well . can you tell me a little bit about the european transition team , which i think is about building resilience within the welsh government to deal with the impacts of brexit ? is that a formal arrangement you have with officials ? i do n't really know much about this team , but it seems to meet fortnightly to get welsh government ready for brexit , so could you just give us some clues on this ? marie knox : yes , in terms of the european transition team , that 's the central co-ordinating group that pulls together all the leads in each department who are pulling together the work on european transition . so , i attend that group in relation to higher education and further education , and , obviously , other representatives in terms of agriculture , transport , the economy , et cetera . suzy davies am : it 's great that you 're on that group , but what does it actually do ? that 's the bit i was n't sure about . marie knox : i guess it provides the governance structure for the welsh government as a whole in relation to european transition . so , individual departments do their own work , and the european transition team provides the governance structure , and , also , they lead on the discussions with the department for exiting the european union , no . 10 , the joint ministerial committee\u2014those kinds of ministerial arrangements ."
