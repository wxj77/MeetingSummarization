    "query": "<s> summarize their discussions on the amendments in group 3 that relate to the regulation-making powers in the bill .",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : okay . right , we 'll therefore take a vote . all those in favour of amendment 2 , please show . all those against . so , there voted four in favour , two against , and amendment 2 is agreed . that takes us on to group 3 , which relates to the regulation-making powers in the bill . the lead amendment in the group is amendment 3 in the name of the deputy minister . i move amendment 3 in the deputy minister 's name and call on the deputy minister to speak to her amendments and the other amendments in this group . julie morgan am : thank you very much , chair . members will note that i 've brought forward an amendment to provide certainty on the date of commencement of the core provision in the bill , which is obviously to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment . and that is going to be debated under group 5 . so , we 're obviously debating that after we deal with these particular technical issues\u2014these are technical issues here , basically . as a consequence of proposing to remove the power for a welsh minister to make an order for commencement , the power to make transitory , transitional or saving provisions in connection with section 1 of the bill coming into force would also be removed . so , i 'm not seeking here to add any new powers to the bill ; amendment 3 will simply add this existing power back onto the face of the bill where amendments 7 and 8 remove it , and amendment 6 will bring the power into force the day after royal assent . in fact , removing the power for the welsh ministers to commence the provision in section 1 by order means the statutory instrument will actually do less than originally intended . these amendments are technical in nature and while i acknowledge that the constitutional and legislative affairs committee raised the issue of what procedure should be applied , their report did not call for any change to no procedure being applied . the absence of an assembly procedure does not mean that ministers ' decisions in relation to transitional powers can not be scrutinised by the assembly . any concerns about the welsh ministers ' proposals could be put to me in the senedd . this was a point made to clac and , as i say , their final conclusion was that no procedure is the appropriate procedure for such a power . for those reasons , i encourage members to reject amendment 3a from suzy . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . suzy davies . suzy davies am : thank you very much . well perhaps , deputy minister , i can begin by saying that one person 's technical issue is another person 's essential part of the legislative procedure and a keen element in scrutiny . but i thank you for noting the assembly 's observations on the ministerial powers granted in this bill\u2014this time by clac , as you say . moving this\u2014and i 'm glad actually that amendment 8 , i think it was , has removed an order provision and we 're moving into an area where at least statutory instruments do feature here . i have to say that amendment 3a is something of a probing amendment , and i 'll explain why now . your amendment 3 seeks to give a familiar range of powers in connection with the coming into force of section 1 , but it 's actually in a substantive part of section 1 itself now\u2014it 's not a separate commencement power . and , actually , i 've been listening to the rest of this debate , and thinking that , if you 're going to be introducing an awareness campaign and a report , the chances are you 're going to need some regulatory powers to introduce some of the aspects of both those policy areas , i think . and i 'm wondering whether the\u2014what is it\u2014transitory , transitional and saving provisions are actually enough powers for you under the course of this bill . i 'm wondering whether you want to consider actually amending this to give yourself the more usual unrestricted power to make regulations in order for you to get section 1 implemented , bearing in mind that it has now been amended from that original , very short and simple\u2014or at least simple in terms of drafting\u2014initial draft . as i say , in anticipation of you rejecting amendments in group 1 i tabled this , in order to make sure that an opportunity remains for the assembly to bring anything you may wish to introduce under section 1 , when it comes into effect , onto the floor of the assembly . because while i completely accept that you 've acknowledged that statutory instrument is the process for introducing things from now on , it 's still possible to do that without procedure , and so i have no idea whether you think what you introduce would be better suited to be introduced by a negative or affirmative procedure . amendment 3a is a holding position , which we will return to you in stage 3 , because i think , again , this is an area where it might be valuable for us to discuss quite what kind of powers you 're looking for , because i think you probably need something that 's beyond transitional , transitory and saving . lynne neagle am : okay . suzy , have you finished ? suzy davies am : yes , thank you very much . lynne neagle am : are there any other members who wish to speak on this group ? no . deputy minister . julie morgan am : i thank suzy for that input . we do n't actually think it 's necessary to have wider powers , but we will keep this under review and at stage 3 , i think that\u2014 . when i was looking at this , i was concerned to know what the transitory powers\u2014what we would actually need to do at that stage , but i can understand that there may be links to other bills in ways that we are not anticipating at the moment that would make it necessary to have those powers . so , basically , i do n't think it is necessary to have wider powers , but i can assure you that we 'll keep that in review coming up to stage 3 . suzy davies am : can i just ask a question on the back of that ? lynne neagle am : will you take a brief intervention at the end , minister ? suzy davies am : will you take the briefest intervention before your full stop ? julie morgan am : i was going to end there , yes . suzy davies am : right , okay , well , just before your full stop , would you just confirm that you 're happy for us to discuss this before stage 3 ? julie morgan am : yes , very happy . yes . suzy davies am : thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . before disposing of amendment 3 , we will deal with the amendment to that amendment . suzy , do you wish to move amendment 3a ? suzy davies am : i 'll move it , yes . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 3a be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] okay , i 'll take a vote by show of hands . all those in favour of amendment 3a . all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against . amendment 3a is not agreed . if amendment 3 is not agreed , amendment 6 will fall . deputy minister , do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 3 ? the question is that amendment 3 be agreed . does any member object ? amendment 3 is therefore agreed . the committee will now break for 10 minutes and reconvene at 11.05 a.m. can i welcome members back ? we will move on to group 4 , which relates to the duty to ensure sufficient funding . the lead amendment in the group is amendment 11 in the name of janet finch-saunders . i call on janet finch-saunders to move amendment 11 and to speak to her amendments . janet ."
