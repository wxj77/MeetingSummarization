    "answer": "industrial designer : uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it 's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . um on the left we 've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . project manager : industrial designer : uh this is the power key , um it 's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : uh that 's the little menu key . this is the infra-red section so you g it 'll be sending rays and if you 're you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it 'll send it . project manager : yeah , good , good . industrial designer : uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : so you can you know talk to it like that and it 'll still understand . project manager : right . industrial designer : um the logo is down down there um project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit 's the cover and it kinda goes over everything project manager : yep , yep , industrial designer : and then there 's holes for the buttons to come through . um . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , project manager : uh-huh . user interface : just kind of a light non-descript grey project manager : yep yep . user interface : so that people 'll wan na buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make ipod covers , project manager : showing me age , user interface : so they kinda just stretch over . project manager : i do n't know what i c ipod covers are like . industrial designer : user interface : yeah , well project manager : yeah yeah . user interface : i i did n't know that but yeah they 're kind of it 's just kind of a rubbery project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and that way you know project manager : okay , user interface : spongy like is something that people wanted project manager : yep , right . user interface : and it just sort of stretches over industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : and that way i think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well project manager : okay . industrial designer : but it 's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers user interface : and industrial designer : you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . this is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself user interface : just kinda stretch it over industrial designer : and it 'll be fine . project manager : okay , good yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and it 'll just stay on industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the r_r_ . project manager : yep , right . industrial designer : li that 'll be the covers as well , yeah yeah . project manager : yeah , yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : i mean tha it 's it 's a detailed point , i just wondered i mean h how will people put these down i wonder ? user interface : like that . project manager : right . okay for some strange re reason i had it in my mind that they 'd put them down vertically industrial designer : yeah it could stand , yeah . project manager : but uh uh user interface : oh . industrial designer : well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit project manager : yeah , uh no industrial designer : so it would stand like that . project manager : because particularly if they 've dif if they 're gon na have it as a you know as a fashion item industrial designer : yeah , standing . project manager : uh i mean it it 's uh it it 's just i mean it 's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh industrial designer : yeah , we could just widen it out uh project manager : yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they 've got them um industrial designer : mm . mm . project manager : because actually have several upon the uh marketing : could have one for your stereo , one for your d_v_ player . industrial designer : mm , yeah , yeah . project manager : yeah , well . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : have to if we just lengthen it i guess project manager : yeah industrial designer : so it comes down to the base of the hand user interface : yeah , project manager : but that that 's uh but uh user interface : just kind of industrial designer : and then flatten it out and could sit there . project manager : the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh industrial designer : yeah , mm . user interface : or just make it little . project manager : yeah yeah , industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : somewhere like that project manager : no no , i mean that 's these uh user interface : so it just sort of industrial designer : we might have to lengthen it marketing : yeah i kinda had a a kinda a natural kind of a idea industrial designer : so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that . yeah . marketing : where it 's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant project manager : but uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the marketing : for the more natural kinda user interface : . project manager : yeah , yeah , yeah , industrial designer : the final product would actually stand up , yeah . project manager : i mean it it 's uh would n't user interface : fall over . project manager : would n't do that , indeed yeah . but th th but th yeah th b the user interface : yeah . project manager : these were all minor minor uh minor details , industrial designer : yeah , yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : i think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on industrial designer : yeah . user interface : . 's a little longer . project manager : and the i industrial designer : wee project manager : it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different . um , so user interface : yeah . project manager : good that 's that that 's excellent ."
