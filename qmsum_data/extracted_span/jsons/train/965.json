    "query": "<s> what would the government do about small businesses in canada ?",
    "answer": "ms. raquel dancho ( kildonanst . paul , cpc ) : thank you , mr . chair . small businesses in manitoba employ 73 % of manitobans . that 's over 286,000 manitobans . i 've been speaking with many small business owners in my riding . it 's been heartbreaking , frankly , to hear that everything they 've built and sacrificed for is in serious jeopardy , and through no fault of their own . your government has created programs that are supposed to help them , but many legitimate businesses are n't able to apply . that could mean bankruptcy and cost thousands of manitobans jobs . this is wrong . i 'm hoping to hear specifics , not just nice words , on what you 're going to do to help them . there are three issues regarding access to the $ 40,000 ceba loan . first , businesses that recently incorporatedfor example , in late 2019are unable to apply their entire 2019 payroll . as a result , many are falling short of the $ 20,000 payroll threshold required to qualify for this loan . second , many businesses contract their employees rather than have them on payroll . they also are unable to qualify for this loan . third , many businesses use personal rather than business banking accounts . they are n't able to qualify for this loan either . what is your government going to do about these three scenarios ? the chair : i just want to remind honourable members to place their questions through the chair and not directly to the minister . as well , please take into consideration the interpreters , who have to listen and translate , so that we can have this conversation ."
