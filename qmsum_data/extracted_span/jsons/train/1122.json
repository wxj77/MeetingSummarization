    "query": "<s> how was the effectiveness of the pupil development grant funding ?",
    "answer": "llyr gruffydd am : thank you , chair , and good morning . i just want to start by asking about your perception of how schools are using the pupil development grant funding , and to what extent they are genuinely targeting that funding exclusively towards children eligible for free school meals . meilyr rowlands : thank you for the question . this grant has been targeted far better by now than it was originally . estyn has made several reports regarding the effectiveness of the grant , and , really , going back to before this specific grant , to a similar grant , called raise . at the start of this grant , the funding was often spent on tackling underachievement , rather than dealing with the underachievement of children who are eligible for free school meals specifically . but , over a period of time , we have seen that it is targeted much better by now . that 's not to say that the targeting is working perfectly still , and i think that we are seeing examples where the targeting is n't going just to children who receive free school meals . schools sometimes interpret poverty in a slightly wider way than that . in terms of what schools are doing with the grant , we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things that they are doing . they are tracking progress of pupils , they are trying to improve attendance , they are trying to work with families and the community in general , they 're doing work specifically to improve how children are doing in exams , in key stage 4 , specifically\u2014a lot of funding is being spent on that\u2014improving the confidence of students , taking students on extra-curricular activities , improving literacy and numeracy . those are the kinds of activities they 're being used for . llyr gruffydd am : because the research by ipsos mori and the wales institute of social and economic research , data and methods has shown that there is some kind of blurring\u2014i think that 's the term that they use\u2014in terms of who is eligible . but you are relatively comfortable with the fact that there is sufficient targeting happening . you referred to the fact that it is used , perhaps , to reach a slightly wider cohort than just those who are eligible for free school meals , but you do feel that that balance , from your experience , is acceptable ."
