    "answer": "marketing : i 'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh in a in the recent surveys , uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy . project manager : marketing : twenty-five euros , uh that 's that 's a preson reasonable price . that 's a market price right now . now if we 're gon na take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , but give them added things that they do n't have now , then it w it could possibly sell . obviously the risk is there . too expensive , they 're not gon na buy . but , i think uh there 's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested . industrial designer : speech recognition ? . marketing : and we 're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : obviously , we ca n't make a remote into a computer , but maybe simple commands . i dunno , louder , softer , on , off . that might be a possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this . project manager : marketing : thirty-five percent say they 're too difficult to use . so we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly . uh fifty percent say they ca n't find the remote half the time . industrial designer : marketing : so maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there 's a beep beep beep , and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home . project manager : marketing : but , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that 's not gon na be possible . but if it 's trendy , if it 's fancy , it 's got some colour to it , if it 's very easy easy to use , if it 's got simple remote speech remote uh control , like i said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , i can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause i ca n't turn the tv on . so we 're gon na have to look at it in a in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design ."
