    "answer": "suzy davies am : yes , just quickly . obviously , i think we 've all been to schools where the pdg is actually used to engage parents more for exactly the reasons you say . but i just wanted to interrogate the deprivation gap a little bit , because , of course , even though , as you say , there 's perhaps more equity in wales , one of the reasons for that is because our children from better-off backgrounds do less well , and considerably less well than their peers in the other parts of the united kingdom . so , whereas their attainment gaps are pretty dreadful , that 's one of the reasons\u2014that our better-off children are n't doing as well as perhaps they might do . is that a concern as well ? we do n't want this rush to the middle , do we ? meilyr rowlands : i think it 's essential that all groups of pupils do as well as they possibly can , absolutely . so , it 's not quite the same issue , but we 've talked about the importance of making sure that more able and talented children do well . suzy davies am : they 're not the same ."
