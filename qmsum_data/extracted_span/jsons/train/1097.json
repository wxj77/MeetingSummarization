    "answer": "mr. john williamson ( new brunswick southwest , cpc ) : thank you , mr . chair . i will say that this is no substitute for parliament , but i appreciate the opportunity . new brunswick families and businesses are rapidly making adjustments to manage and live with the coronavirus pandemic . businesses here are opening and services are being offered . families are preparing for summer and even planning ahead for a new school year in september . we have a lot of work ahead of us . one notable absence is service canada . when does the government plan on opening its service counters to assist canadians again ? hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr . chair , our government is committed to ensuring that canadians continue to have access to the benefits that they rely on through service canada . we have redeployed over 3,000 additional staff to ensure that canadians continue to have access to their benefits . we 've established a 1,500-agent call centre to make sure that people can get access to the phone lines to get the help they need . mr. john williamson : service canada is about more than providing covid-19 information and benefits . provincial governments are working hard to adjust to canada 's new normal by opening up businesses and front-line government services . when will we see service canada play its role and open its service counters in our communities ? hon . ahmed hussen : mr . chair , we 're currently working with our world-class public health experts to determine how best to reopen the service canada network for the public . make no mistake : our service canada employees have gone above and beyond to ensure that canadians continue to have access to the services that they rely on and the benefits that they need . mr. john williamson : please do n't hide behind health experts when the prime minister is appearing in the middle of large protests , yet is afraid to bring back the parliament of canada to do its business . in fact , the new brunswick legislature is open for regular business . bills are being studied , opposition input is being heard and mlas are voting on legislation , not rubber-stamping government bills . by comparison , our parliament is stuck in pretending it can not function like other law-making assemblies . canadians are in the dark about our country 's finances . when will the government table an economic update so taxpayers understand what was spent , what is owed by our kids and grandchildren , and what the government 's fiscal footing looks like ? hon . pablo rodriguez : mr . chair , nobody 's hiding . nobody 's doing anything like that . the only reason my colleague is able to ask a question and i 'm able to answer his question is that he 's right there on the screen . we have this hybrid format that cares for mps across the country , not only the ones sitting in the house . mr. john williamson : this is no substitute for parliament . i will ask my question again . when will the government table an economic update so that taxpayers understand what was spent , what is owed by our kids and grandchildren , and what the government 's fiscal footing looks like in today 's environment ? hon . mona fortier : mr . chair , i thank my honourable colleague for his question . canada 's economy is still in a period of extraordinary uncertainty due to covid-19 . we have been open and transparent about the measures we have been providing to support families , businesses and workers . even our health care the chair : we 'll go back to mr. williamson . mr. john williamson : except you have not . the auditor general is underfunded . we have no idea about the total of government spending . again i will ask when the government will table an economic update so that we can have an understanding of what the government 's fiscal footing looks like . hon . mona fortier : mr . chair , we have included biweekly reports to parliament on the full cost and status of our economic response plan measures since the beginning . i have said , and i will continue to say , that when it is possible to provide a clear economic projection , we will provide an update . mr. john williamson : what is the full cost to date of the government 's covid-19 relief measures , as the minister just claimed the government has provided to parliament ? hon . mona fortier : mr . chair , we have provided support for workers , and 2.5 million canadians have been helped through the canadian wage subsidy . we have provided businesses with some loans , and 669,000 businesses have applied for these loans . even for the cerb , we have over eight million canadians who have applied . the chair : we will now continue with mr.bergeron . mr. stphane bergeron : mr.chair , as the leader of the bloc qubcois mentioned a few moments ago , the government promised $ 14billion to quebec and the provinces , but in targeted transfers . that is very little compared to the considerable expenses incurred to deal with the current crisis . but quebec and the provinces do n't just want this money to be transferred unconditionally , they also want a real discussion on a permanent increase in health care transfers . premierlegault was rightly concerned about the feds ' interference into provincial jurisdictions . the federal government , which does not manage any hospitals or long-term care centres , must stop playing armchair quarterback and transfer the money to the only governments with jurisdiction over health , that is , quebec and the provinces . will it do so without delay and without nitpicking ? the honourable patty hajdu ( minister of health ) : mr.chair , we know that the government of quebec is working hard to ensure the safety of quebeckers and we are here to support them . as part of this co-operation , we have developed health and safety recommendations for workplaces , we have purchased medical equipment for workers and we have supported the province in developing its reopening program . we are continuing this important partnership to ensure the safety of quebeckers and all canadians . mr. stphane bergeron : the co-operation is so effective that the money is staying in the federal government 's coffers . in fact , when the federal government wants to impose conditions , it always takes longer . we see it with housing , for which quebec has not received a dime of the $ 1.4billion it is owed . we have also seen it with infrastructure funds , particularly for public transit , water systems and water treatment . the health crisis is now . the needs are now . the much needed reopening of our economy is now . will the government finally transfer the money without messing around or quibbling ? hon . pablo rodriguez : i am pleased to confirm to my colleague that there is no messing around , no quibbling , nothing of the kind . there is co-operation between two levels of government . it is natural to have discussions with all the provinces and with quebec . i myself am taking part in some discussions and several of my colleagues are taking part in others . there is a clear willingness on the part of the federal government to co-operate with quebec and all the provinces . that is what we are doing and that is perhaps what the bloc qubcois does not like . it likes bickering , but for the time being , there is none . mr. stphane bergeron : we do n't want to bicker , we want the money to be paid out . it is not complicated , for heaven 's sake ! we do not want a blank cheque . right now , the money remains in the federal government 's coffers . there is $ 1.4billion that should be paid to quebec for social housing and is sitting in the federal government 's coffers . we are waiting for money for water treatment and water systems , but it is sitting in the federal government 's coffers . it 's almost july . we are wasting precious months for construction . what is the government waiting for to pay out the money so that we can get our economy rolling ? hon . pablo rodriguez : the federal government is a very active partner . we are discussing and working with quebec on infrastructure projects . we are continuing our discussions and negotiations on the housing agreement . nothing is at a standstill . we are discussing and co-operating for the well-being of all quebeckers . mr. stphane bergeron : madamchair , things are definitely at a standstill , because the money is owed and has not been paid out . months are going by while construction is not taking place . we need to reopen the economy . we need more flexibility in the gas tax program and quebec 's contribution to allow municipalities to undertake work on city halls , community centres and fire stations . we need the federal government to contribute to funding public transit operations , which have become a real financial drain because of the drop in ridership . what is the federal government waiting for to provide real help instead of just talking ?"
