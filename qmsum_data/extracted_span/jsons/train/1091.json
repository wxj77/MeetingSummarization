    "query": "<s> what did the group talk about the uncertainty of canadian economy and what the government should do during the special period ?",
    "answer": "mr. jagmeet singh : mr . chair , with regard to the cerb extension , can the prime minister guarantee that everyone who is receiving cerb payments now will continue to do so without any gaps throughout the summer ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , i am happy to highlight that many canadians who were on the cerb are now returning to work . many more who are on the cerb now will be returning to work in the coming weeks . we know that as the economy gets back to work , people will want to the chair : we will go back to mr. singh . mr. jagmeet singh : can the prime minister assure people who need it that they will continue to receive the cerb over the summer , yes or no ? right hon . justin trudeau : we are very pleased to point out that we are going to extend the canada emergency response benefit for at least another eight weeks , because a lot of people are going to need it . even if they want to work , there are n't enough jobs for everyone . so we 'll be there for them , as we have been from the beginning . the chair : we 're going to pause and suspend proceedings just for a few moments to allow our support staff to substitute for one another in a healthy and safe way . we 'll now proceed with ms. mcleod . mrs. cathy mcleod ( kamloopsthompsoncariboo , cpc ) : mr . chair , it was really a surprise in the middle of a pandemic to see the prime minister at his first campaign stop last week in ottawa . certainly the game plan has become very transparent . he has a daily report show and he wants to sideline parliament , dominate the news cycle and keep everyone in the dark about the state of the economy . according to the parliamentary budget officer , there is no reason that he can not provide the fiscal update during the covid-19 pandemic , and the pbo has published a number of reports himself . why wo n't the prime minister provide a fiscal update so we can all understand the state of our economy , or is that just not part of his campaign playbook ? hon . mona fortier ( minister of middle class prosperity and associate minister of finance ) : thank you , mr . chair . canada 's economy is in a period of extraordinary uncertainty due to covid-19 . we 've been clear about that . we will continue to be open and transparent about the actions that we are taking to support families , businesses , workers , our health care system and our economy . this includes biweekly reports to parliament on the full cost and status of our economic measures . once it is possible to provide a clear economic projection , we will provide an update . we are in this together , and we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to support canadians . mrs. cathy mcleod : chair , canada 's economy was in trouble prior to the covid , with some of the worst numbers since 2009 . government revenues in march dropped by 7.2 % , and it 's shameful and , quite frankly , it 's outrageous that they refuse to provide parliament and canadians with an economic update . households during this challenging time know how much money is coming in and they know how much money is going out . the picture is not pretty , but they know what the picture is . can the finance minister at least reveal the projected revenue decline in quarters one and two ? hon . mona fortier : the canadian economy is going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty due to covid-19 . we 've known this for three months . we 've continued to be open and transparent about the measures we 've put in place for canadians , workers and businesses . in fact , we have reported biweekly to parliament on the total cost and status of our plan 's measures . as soon as it 's possible to provide clear economic projections , we will provide a comprehensive update to canadians the chair : we go back to ms. mcleod . mrs. cathy mcleod : other governments have managed to provide updates for their citizens and carry out their responsibilities , but of course this government has sidelined parliament with simply a question-but-no-answer period . let 's try something else . the forestry industry was in crisis even before the pandemic , with mills closing down and thousands of jobs lost . eight weeks ago , minister freeland said , i have had many discussions with leaders in our forestry sector and the provinces about what we can do to support the industry today . meanwhile , we 've had support going to the arts and we 've had support going to fisheries , just to name a few , but arguably for the industry that was having some of the most numerous challenges , it has been radio silence . that was eight weeks ago today . can the government at least commit to releasing an updated softwood lumber transition plan before we rise ? hon . seamus o'regan ( minister of natural resources ) : mr . chair , we remain committed , of course , to the forestry industry and seeing it through this pandemic and this very uncertain time . the expanding market opportunities program , for instance , has helped canada 's forestry sector diversify , create jobs and open new markets . we 've had new construction projects that are active today , using canadian wood in key markets like korea , japan , china and the united states . tomorrow this house will vote on our government 's investment of $ 20.97 million for this program . it 's part of our budget 2019 commitment to invest $ 251 million over three years , and i hope the opposition will support us in that . mrs. cathy mcleod : it was stated in a major newspaper this morning that this government is like a sexy sports carvroom , vroom , vroombut with a history of breakdowns and major repairs . i think that might describe what has been happening . for forestry , it has been eight weeks and there has been nothing . there is another area that deputy prime minister freeland did talk about . we were talking about the u.s. softwood lumber duties that are being held in the united states . it 's billions of dollars being held with the u.s. treasury . in april , she acknowledged that these duties are a real issue for the softwood lumber industry . what 's been done since that time ? hon . david lametti ( minister of justice and attorney general of canada ) : mr . chair , canada 's forestry industry supports good middle-class jobs in communities across our country . the sector is also an essential link in the medical equipment supply chain , and we thank them for all the work they 're doing . we 're aware of the immense pressures faced by this sector , especially at this time , and deputy prime minister freeland and others are taking that seriously and working through this issue . as our government has said repeatedly , we firmly believe that the u.s. duties on canadian softwood lumber are unfair and unwarranted , and we will pursue all means in order to the chair : before continuing , i want to remind honourable members who are at home to make sure that the boom on their headsets is down . it just makes a better pickup . we heard everything , but it was a little distant . that 's for everyone 's benefit . we 're now going to continue with mr.deltell . mr. grard deltell ( louis-saint-laurent , cpc ) : mr.chair , before i ask my question , i 'd like to pay tribute to the minister of justice , particularly to his versatility . today , he talked about forests . yesterday , the minister of justice talked about davie and indigenous affairs . really , this minister is very versatile . my question is directly for the minister of finance . i like mr.lametti very much , but i 'd like mr.morneau to answer my question . yesterday , in a senate parliamentary committee , the minister of finance half-opened the door to an economic update . based on what he said , it seems that , as we speak , a committee of the department of finance is working on an economic update . could mr.morneau tell canadians when he is going to table this economic update ? hon . mona fortier : mr.chair , as we know , the canadian economy is going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty . as soon as it 's possible to provide clear economic projections , we will provide a full update to canadians . right now , we can say that we have supported workers , businesses and canadians with the emergency measures we have put in place . we will continue to do so , because we need to be sure that canadians can get through this crisis . mr. grard deltell : mr.chair , i thought it was too good to be true . the minister of finance is opening the door , and the minister of small business is closing it . we do n't know when the economic update will take place , yet all across canada , provinces are doing economic updates . could mr.morneau explain to canadians why he is unable to give one ? hon . mona fortier : mr.chair , since the beginning of the crisis , we have implemented the economic action plan to respond to covid-19 , and we 've provided immediate assistance to canadians , businesses and workers . over 2.5million jobs were protected by the canada emergency wage subsidy . in addition , 8.4million canadians the chair : we are returning to mr.deltell . mr. grard deltell : mr.chair , next friday , the quebec minister of finance , ericgirard , will give an economic update . if ericgirard can give one for quebec , why ca n't billmorneau give one for canada ? hon . mona fortier : mr.chair , once again , we have been open and transparent from the outset . we have devoted our energy to support canadians , workers and businesses . we will continue to do so . mr. grard deltell : mr.chair , i can not judge the quality of the work done by the provinces , but what i do know is that quebec , saskatchewan and newfoundland have also made efforts to support their residents economically . those provinces are able to table economic updates . yesterday , saskatchewan even tabled a budget . why is bill morneau unable to table an economic update for all canadians ? hon . mona fortier : let me repeat for my hon . colleague that we are going through extraordinarily uncertain times . we have continued to be open and transparent . we have reported biweekly to parliament on the total cost and status of the measures in our economic response plan . once again , as soon as clear economic projections can be provided , we will provide an update the chair : mr.deltell has the floor . mr. grard deltell : the minister talks about the total cost of the government 's economic expenditures . so i ask the question : so far , over the past three months , how much has the pandemic cost canadians ? hon . mona fortier : as i said earlier , it is important to note that we have put forward measures , including the wage subsidy , which have helped more than 2.5million the chair : mr.deltell has the floor . mr. grard deltell : mr.chair , i have been trying for four minutes to get anything remotely resembling an answer , and i 'm getting absolutely nothing . i am not asking questions for myself ; i am asking questions for canadians . why are the government and the minister of finance , bill morneau , not able to table an economic update when some provinces are able to ? hon . mona fortier : once again , i would like to remind my hon . colleague that we have provided interest-free loans to businesses . more than 669,000loans have been approved . we have continued to support businesses and canadians during this time the chair : mr.deltell , you have time for a very brief question . mr. grard deltell : the only thing that distinguishes the provinces that table economic updates and the current government is political will . why does bill morneau not have the political will to tell canadians the truth ?"
