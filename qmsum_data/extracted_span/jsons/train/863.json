    "answer": "professor b : well , here 's the problem . and and uh bhaskara and i was talking about this a little earlier today is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the mode thing . and uh grad a : well i oh yeah , i unders i understand that , i just uh it 's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that . professor b : well , i but that 's what we have to do . ok , so , so , uh . there there are a variety of ways of doing it . uh . let me just mention something that i do n't want to pursue today which is there are technical ways of doing it , uh i i slipped a paper to bhaskara and about noisy - or 's and noisy - maxes and there 're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your bayes - net - edness . uh , so . if you co you could ima and i now i do n't know that any of those actually apply in this case , but there is some technology you could try to apply . grad a : so it 's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that ok . professor b : yeah . yeah . and , um so . grad a : so in that case , the sum we 'd have we i mean , these would n't be the summary nodes . we 'd have the summary nodes like where the things were i guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other professor b : yeah . grad a : yeah . professor b : so what i was gon na say is is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally i mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are . so , if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode , you know , what are the most relevant things . and the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n each node sufficiently narrow that you do n't get this combinatorics . so that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be , ok ? then you could say `` aha , let 's have these three factors `` , ok ? and maybe a binary version f for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one . it was much too quick for me . ok , so let me see if i understand what you 're saying . so , i i do understand that uh you can take the m - three - l and add not and it w and you need to do this , for sure , we have to add , you know , not too much about um object types and stuff , and what i think you did is add some rules of the style that are already there that say `` if it 's of type `` landmark `` , then you take you 're gon na take a picture of it . `` grad d : exactly . professor b : f full stop , i mean , that 's what you do . ev - every landmark you take a picture of , grad d : every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible . professor b : you enter you approach . ok . uh , and certainly you can add rules like that to the existing smartkom system . and you just did , right ? ok . grad d : yeah . and it it would do us no good . that ultimately . professor b : well . so , s well , and let 's think about this . um , that 's a that 's another kind of baseline case , that 's another sort of thing `` ok , here 's a another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this `` . add extra properties , a deterministic rule for every property you have an action , `` pppt ! `` you do that . um , then the question would be uh now , if that 's all you 're doing , then you can get the types from the ontology , ok ? because that 's all you 're all you 're using is this type the types in the ontology and you 're done . right ? so we do n't we do n't use the discourse , we do n't use the context , we do n't do any of those things ."
