    "answer": "project manager : okay um we have we 've about fifteen minutes left , industrial designer : oh we probably have to get going , do n't we ? project manager : so i 'm i 'm gon na continue with my pres presentation . um i 've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so i 'll just bring that up and show you all industrial designer : 'kay . project manager : before we move on . um industrial designer : could could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? in different fruit and vegetable colours , marketing : if i get any more information of fruits and vegetables , i 'll let you know . user interface : like , to make it different fruits . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , it 's possible . project manager : yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex industrial designer : exactly . project manager : wherea but the actual model could be titanium . industrial designer : and you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever . all these options . user interface : i think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel . so instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control 's inside . marketing : well , project manager : ah hmm hmm hmm . industrial designer : oh . user interface : do n't know . marketing : there we go . the ipod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it 's like the way it all comes all cute . industrial designer : mm . options . marketing : lemons ? industrial designer : user interface : project manager : okay , um marketing : project manager : components concept . energy , chip on print . industrial designer : uh-hu oh , oh yes . right , i had sort of skipped over that hoping it would n't get be necessary but um project manager : that 's th th this is the agenda they gave me . so can you just explain what that is real quick ? industrial designer : alright , so um decisions , what the okay deci decisions on energy i 'm thinking is based on the battery . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um i dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? project manager : i think it 's awesome . i think it 's really cool . industrial designer : am i yeah . marketing : yeah , i mean , it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , um i think it 's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , industrial designer : right , i have n't gotten any user interface : but as far as i know , the technology is good . marketing : costs . industrial designer : yeah , any more information on cost other than it 's more expensive than a regular battery , but um but if we 're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it 'll even out , i think . marketing : but over time industrial designer : um circuit boards . um yeah , i got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . they 're they 're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di i think they 're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . project manager : industrial designer : i do n't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . i was n't really given any options , i was just given that this is how they 're done . project manager : okay . industrial designer : um yeah , i ca n't ca n't really tell you . i can i can tell you a whole lot about how it works . but i do n't know any decisions on marketing : project manager : if they 're if they 're really options . industrial designer : yeah . i 'm sorry , project manager : okay . industrial designer : i did f user interface : al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , i think . uh it 's fairly fairly standard . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um okay , then we 'll move on to the case . um oh bu i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . industrial designer : right . well okay , here 's the here 's the thing on the chips that i that i got . um simple , regular , advanced chip on print . the chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we do n't have to worry about that . um , 'kay , the pushbutton if we 're gon na have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an lcd requires advanced . do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ? user interface : um i do n't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . i mean it might be nice for changing the volume . project manager : it would be nice for changing the volume , industrial designer : oh . user interface : uh but project manager : but i do n't know how useful it 'd be for changing the channel . 'cause you do n't have control over numbers user interface : i do n't think it would really work . marketing : yeah , it 's a project manager : or industrial designer : yeah , user interface : yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel . industrial designer : th it 'd be it 'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . marketing : but if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : we have five minutes left for the meeting , so . marketing : and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as i 'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we 're gon na have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no it 's gon na inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . user interface : yeah . project manager : so , have a scroll for volume ? industrial designer : f or for all those secret functions ? when you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . user interface : i think yeah , i think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it 's not necessary . um industrial designer : right . so we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later . i do n't know . project manager : i think w well i think when we go on to the une userface , we 're gon na have to decide the interface we 're gon na have to decide um whether we 're gon na have a scroll or not . industrial designer : okay . well , let 's think about that while we talk about the case . project manager : okay , let 's do case . industrial designer : uh i 'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . user interface : yeah . project manager : i 'm a little um i 'm a little hesitant about it , because i 'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . industrial designer : okay . project manager : um marketing : oh could it be hard , and then something around it ? industrial designer : uh yeah , everything i 've project manager : yeah , i would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . industrial designer : n oh wha what i 've what i 've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there 's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it 's just covered with the latex . project manager : mm-hmm . okay . industrial designer : not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you 've seen like that . project manager : mm-hmm . okay . industrial designer : the inside is hard . i do n't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , i think that that 's done for us . project manager : okay . user interface : 'kay . yeah . project manager : so we uh we do want latex . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . latex . um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . marketing : industrial designer : yeah . project manager : fruity colours . okay um let 's go to the ufe user interface then we 'll come back to the chip i suppose . industrial designer : oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? or a double-curved ? project manager : well , we do n't really know what the difference is , right ? marketing : i 'm thinking curved of some sort . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we do n't really know what the difference project manager : um okay , interface , the type and the supplements . so push or scroll , user interface : um project manager : right ? or both ? user interface : yep . um and i think if we wan na keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it 's simpler , it 's it 's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . industrial designer : good point . user interface : so in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it 's probably better to have pushbuttons . project manager : mm-hmm . and if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . user interface : yeah , yeah , it 's uh it 's it 's fairly simple . project manager : i think that yeah . for channel surfing i think a scroll an actual like an ipod 's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , i dunno . industrial designer : yeah . i say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it 's got ta be some more expensive , so i think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . project manager : is that okay with you ? industrial designer : because project manager : how you feeling ? marketing : yeah . and let 's like see if we get anything else . i mean i 'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it 's more just to give it a different kind of look , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but if it 's gon na be in a latex type thing and that 's gon na look cool , then that 's probably gon na have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . project manager : it might be cool enough . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay , so we 're gon na go with um type pushbuttons , and then supplements , how are we gon na do that ? user interface : uh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ? project manager : um i assume that 's what else we 're gon na like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use . user interface : um project manager : so we 're gon na have like a menu button , so that we can access on-screen things then ? user interface : yep . yeah . project manager : okay , um so we 're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . industrial designer : alright . user interface : um in industrial designer : so what are what are our buttons gon na be ? user interface : yeah . on off , industrial designer : on off user interface : uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . industrial designer : so like one through five , or user interface : yeah , yeah marketing : like a radio type sorta situation ? user interface : about yeah like yeah , a bit like radio presets . um project manager : pre-set channels and then we 're gon na need um numbers one through zero , right ? user interface : uh we would n't even need the numbers . i think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned . project manager : well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh i guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you 're scrolling through . user interface : yeah , yeah , you can just and you need some kind of , i dunno , sort of up down kind of button , industrial designer : yeah , up down . user interface : but the volume control could double for that , for example . project manager : mm-hmm . okay , um finishing the meeting now . um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , industrial designer : project manager : um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . you 'll get specific instructions from your personal coach . industrial designer : ooh . user interface : cool . project manager : um did we decide on a chip ? let 's go with a simple chip ? industrial designer : simple chip . project manager : okay . we are done . thank you everyone . oh i di these are already in our shared folder , so . industrial designer : okay , cool . clay ."
