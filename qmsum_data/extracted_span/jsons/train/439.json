    "query": "<s> what did grad e think about the goal of his experiment ?",
    "answer": "grad e : uh - huh . so that was encouraging . and , um , that that um , that 's encouraging for for the idea of using it in an interactive system like and , um , another issue i 'm i 'm thinking about is in the smartkom system . so say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time , but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ? and , um so i w bef before , um back in may , i did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . in those i trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . and , um , here , i was curious , what if i trained the models using twelve seconds but i f i gave it a situation where the test set i was subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . and , um so i did that for about three different conditions . and , um i mean , i th i think it was , um , four se i think i think it was , um , something like four seconds and , um , six seconds , and eight seconds . something like that . and it seems like it it it hurts compared to if you actually train the models { comment } using th that same length of time but it it does n't hurt that much . um , u usually less than point five percent , although i think i did see one where it was a point eight percent or so rise in word error rate . but this is , um , w where , um , even if i train on the , uh , model , and mean subtracted it with the same length of time as in the test , it the word error rate is around , um , ten percent or nine percent . so it does n't seem like that big a d a difference . professor c : but it but looking at it the other way , is n't it what you 're saying that it did n't help you to have the longer time for training , if you were going to have a short time for grad e : that that 's true . um , professor c : i mean , why would you do it , if you knew that you were going to have short windows in testing . phd a : yeah , it seems like for your i mean , in normal situations you would never get twelve seconds of speech , right ? i 'm not e u phd b : you need twelve seconds in the past to estimate , right ? or l or you 're looking at six sec seconds in future and six in professor c : yeah . grad e : um , t twelve s professor c : no , total . grad e : n n uh for the test it 's just twelve seconds in the past . phd b : no , it 's all oh , ok . phd a : is this twelve seconds of uh , regardless of speech or silence ? or twelve seconds of speech ? grad e : of of speech . phd b : mm - hmm . professor c : the other thing , um , which maybe relates a little bit to something else we 've talked about in terms of windowing and so on is , that , um , i wonder if you trained with twelve seconds , and then when you were two seconds in you used two seconds , and when you were four seconds in , you used four seconds , and when you were six and you basically build up to the twelve seconds . so that if you have very long utterances you have the best , grad e : yeah . professor c : but if you have shorter utterances you use what you can . grad e : right . and that 's actually what we 're planning to do in professor c : ok . yeah ."
