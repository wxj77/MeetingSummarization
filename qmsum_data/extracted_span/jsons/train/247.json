    "query": "<s> what did the team discuss about the product cost ?",
    "answer": "project manager : okay , finance . because um user interface : shoot . project manager : i received uh a spreadsheet . marketing : a five . a five . project manager : yeah , but i uh actually do n't need this presentation , i guess . oh . marketing : does n't matter . project manager : i 'm gon na open the spreadsheet and we 're gon na work this out together , because i did n't really fin uh i have a . did n't really finish it . well , we uh we 'll see . we 'll stumble upon some problems . marketing : we probably will . project manager : i probably have already opened it here . try it again . first of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . but let 's let 's st start with beginning . we include one battery . i i uh i 'll explain its uh , the the components are listed over here . uh , price is given . we um yeah , marketing : the amount , yeah . project manager : we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . and then uh , we 'll uh calcula do n't watch the number yet . i do n't know if it 's filled in properly . okay , we need one battery . one battery . i think one battery is enough . we do n't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . a s okay , this this is a p first problem . uh , i think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips industrial designer : uh it 's it 's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . project manager : okay . but industrial designer : the simple chip is e enough i i think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh marketing : i do n't know project manager : where did we find this information ? was it marketing : i have n't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . project manager : i think it was uh your job in the first uh meet uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . industrial designer : no , uh i yes , my my my uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : the the email i got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like i think the advanced chip maybe . marketing : yeah . and how do you know ? i mean , you got that email . did it point out what to use them for ? industrial designer : bec no , the they did n't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . project manager : maybe you can uh look it up right now . okay , but okay . when we do n't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what industrial designer : then it 's a simple chip . project manager : then it would be a simple chip . and with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . industrial designer : yes , i i i s i marketing : alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , i guess . project manager : okay . industrial designer : that will be enough for future uh recommendations . project manager : yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . the sample sensor sample speaker . what is it m is that the speaker we were t i do n't know what it is . industrial designer : i do n't know it uh either . marketing : i do n't know . project manager : okay , we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber . and with a special colour . i guess that 's what we were user interface : well , special colour . . project manager : yeah , i do n't know about the special colour , but i think w uh industrial designer : otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . user interface : i do n't marketing : i do n't know if it 's very special . project manager : yeah , i think we uh we have special colours . user interface : mm okay . industrial designer : standard rubber . marketing : alright , that 's okay . project manager : okay , then the push-button , i was just counting them . industrial designer : st project manager : uh , i think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , is n't it ? user interface : whoa , it 's a little project manager : well that 's bit of a problem , because i re but i really do n't understand that , because i can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it would n't be possible according to this uh sheet . user interface : that 's huge . no . we have the simplest buttons . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : no , it 's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . marketing : i do n't think so , because it says amount . industrial designer : if you use a scroll-wheel project manager : ah . yeah , it would n't marketing : the the the yellow row is the amount of project manager : fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost i do n't know . i industrial designer : maybe it 's the kind of push-buttons . you can have f four kind of push-buttons . user interface : uh , one til nine . industrial designer : rubber . user interface : is that one or is that nine buttons ? industrial designer : you can have uh project manager : and i count them like this . one two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . user interface : yeah . project manager : because oh , this is oh , this is one , okay . twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , i uh rated them as uh um as uh uh uh separate buttons . industrial designer : different , marketing : that 's total of four buttons . project manager : and plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it 's will be uh eighteen . marketing : i think that eighteen . one two three four five , si industrial designer : why is that so uh expensive . project manager : yeah , i do n't understand . y i do i do n't get the point , because it 's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . user interface : is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ? marketing : fifty cents for one single stupid button . user interface : no way . industrial designer : so , whe when you so then it project manager : well , okay , well well let 's make it just one . industrial designer : it 's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of project manager : here , now it 's now it 's already s marketing : yeah , exactly . yeah . project manager : shall we just give our own interpretation to , user interface : project manager : because else we would really have a problem . it would be impossible to make it marketing : i ca n't user interface : it 's way marketing : i i i could n't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . really . industrial designer : when you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . board . project manager : and and less buttons than this is n't possible . industrial designer : and then throw it marketing : yeah , yeah , industrial designer : project manager : this is the most simple user interface : no , no no . project manager : yeah , it is possible , but i 've never seen one before . industrial designer : but whe project manager : industrial designer : i 've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , project manager : marketing : no , really . project manager : yeah , without the numbers . that 's possible . yeah , we could skip the numbers . user interface : yeah , uh industrial designer : but but marketing : yeah , but i d i would n't want to own that . really . user interface : that 's still four . industrial designer : uh , it 's it 's still for little children . they can handle that remote control , marketing : yeah . project manager : then uh , teletext would also be im impossible . industrial designer : but but it is n't fo yes , it 's for it 's li uh it 's just for a little user interface : yeah , that 's no option , that 's no option . project manager : okay , we 'll we 'll just okay . but then still , when we there 's no room for a docking station or something . tha w le let 's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . we 'll give the buttons special colour . we 'll give them a special form . uh , i think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , i guess . user interface : a special colour , why a special colour ? project manager : because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . user interface : but wha what s what special ? project manager : i think that 's the what they mean by a special colour . user interface : okay , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise , it user interface : uh , yeah . industrial designer : otherwise it would be the marketing : i do n't think the special form is really true . project manager : i think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that 's what we were planning to do , making it industrial designer : special form also , it says . project manager : yeah , special material r also , marketing : is it ? project manager : because i has rubber . and the buttons have to be rubber . industrial designer : what is the normal material ? user interface : plastic . marketing : yeah , i dunno . industrial designer : sh yeah . user interface : plastic , i think . industrial designer : classic ? user interface : plastic . industrial designer : oh , plastic . marketing : plastic . project manager : 'kay , but the problem now is that the there 's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station project manager : separately . user interface : se no no no . industrial designer : yes . and and but we do n't have to tell it , but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . project manager : yeah , yeah . yeah , but i do like the idea , but we yeah . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : it uh but it then the docking station is n't relevant for this project anymore , but we can industrial designer : no , but you otherwise you ca n't retrieve it . project manager : but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need . marketing : yeah , i really do n't get it . i mean if it 's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents . project manager : i think we can agree on this . i i think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . 'cause i think we uh marketing : yeah , yep . project manager : yeah , i think that 's what what what they uh mean industrial designer : but for two euros and thirty cents , we uh we do n't get a docking station . marketing : i think so , too . oh , i do n't know . project manager : but can we find out uh about uh this chips ? because when we do n't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip . user interface : and then we can get a docking station . project manager : and maybe then we can do something extra . oh , n uh oh , still industrial designer : for project manager : oh , it 's gon na get more expensive with . two . user interface : project manager : then we have some money left . we can put then industrial designer : for two euros . project manager : we can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : uh why ? project manager : yeah , well who knows . or a little bit of tin titanium . marketing : i mean i i if you if it would cost two euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , i mean uh we 're not gon na add uh a trip to hawaii to it . user interface : but what what can we do project manager : yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . that 's also maybe an idea . user interface : but uh what can we do with the simple chip and what 's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? project manager : yeah that 's what then what he has to find out . maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . user interface : if if i project manager : maybe is that that 's nice to know . user interface : regular chip and because we do n't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example . project manager : yeah , bu bu but when we yeah , but when we skip when we um when we do n't use the do we 're not gon na make the docking station , then we still yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , marketing : i like the hand dynamo part . project manager : because that was our our special feature . marketing : we can make a plain docking station for two euros . user interface : yeah . we 'll go back uh tomorrow . marketing : i mean project manager : yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe marketing : wi wi without recharge project manager : it still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . marketing : yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two euros uh if you do n't put the recharge function in it . i mean , it has a shape . project manager : yeah , but for two euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , marketing : of course it has a shape , but i i project manager : then two euros is n't even possible . marketing : why should that not be possible ? project manager : yeah , then because then we 'd thirty cents left . marketing : no , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . project manager : yeah , but yeah , i do n't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip . user interface : that 's the question . if we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f project manager : yeah , and w and and we uh need f industrial designer : it is n't in my information , so i do n't know it uh either . project manager : and what is this ? sample sensor sample speaker . industrial designer : it is n't in my information , i uh i i 've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or project manager : you can look at it for s presentation . s technical functions ? industrial designer : uh i 've got here in uh user interface : no no , they were uh mine , yeah . industrial designer : i will put a i will put a page on it . when my mouse works again . project manager : oh , oh oh . hey . oh . industrial designer : my mouse is uh marketing : dead . reanimate it . user interface : died . industrial designer : oh . ah , i 've got it . i will put uh my email on the the network . marketing : what the hell are these ? industrial designer : it 's on it . marketing : oh , whatever . user interface : yeah , it 's open . marketing : project manager : mm . i do n't think here it 's in here already . user interface : it 's circuit board . it 's only just basics for for project manager : it 's nothing about s yeah . user interface : at the end circuit there is an infrared led . marketing : this is n't helpful . project manager : no . but i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . which one was it ? user interface : components design . project manager : functional requirements ? industrial designer : um marketing : no , that was my presentation . user interface : components design maybe . n on top . industrial designer : yes , that was mine . project manager : ah . ah yes , it was the second one . industrial designer : but that was my second project manager : yeah , it was your second marketing : it 's already open . project manager : your first presentation . marketing : it 's at the bottom . project manager : sorry ? user interface : working design . marketing : it 's uh at your task bar . user interface : yeah , but it 's the the other one . industrial designer : mm project manager : uh , this is n this is not this n user interface : was it working design or components design ? marketing : sorry . project manager : that 's not the right one . i do n't oh . marketing : okay , sorry . project manager : no , this is the other one . or maybe something is uh maybe there 's something abo in in these user interface : chip set . industrial designer : but this is the same uh this is o only the possibilities . project manager : here . industrial designer : yeah . we can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . marketing : yeah , nice . i it does n't say anything . user interface : the display requires an advanced chip . project manager : you know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires industrial designer : ah , okay . project manager : okay , so we only need a simple chip . user interface : requires . industrial designer : with the light . user interface : little lights . yeah , but that that 's just the same as the the led . project manager : no no , that 's just a simple chip . a scroll-wheel marketing : that 's not needed . project manager : it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . so , we do n't need any of them . marketing : a display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . for showing text . industrial designer : lcd . user interface : yeah . marketing : i do n't think that uh just a l a little light user interface : no . i think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . marketing : yeah , i agree . project manager : and what 's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? industrial designer : maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , i guess so too . user interface : yeah , true . well , that 's not too what we want . marketing : next channel . no . well , we might want it , but user interface : project manager : okay . industrial designer : all in twelve euros . project manager : back to the costs . industrial designer : twelve euros and fifty cents . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we 're gon na use the simple chip . user interface : so , simple chip is okay . marketing : great . delete . industrial designer : and the lights . where uh are the lights ? marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , lights , yeah , there 's no marketing : well , there 're three , i guess . user interface : category . project manager : nah , there is some money left to be spent . user interface : can we do it wi within two two euro ? marketing : i think we can make a docking station . yeah . project manager : okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? but i mean it is n't it has n't got any innovative technology , we are n't gon na apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway , i think . i do n't i do n't see any possibility to do so , because it would would n't fit our defi design philosophy . user interface : mm-hmm . but it 's original . project manager : but what w is there some extra marketing : no , that 's true . project manager : maybe i think maybe the kinetic thing is something . instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know , so y so people would n't have to worry about their batteries anymore . maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it industrial designer : but but sometimes you put a project manager : yeah , you leave the p yeah , i know , but still i they will think about that . i mean if you u industrial designer : kinetics are n't uh nowadays only used in watches and that 's because you 're always walking . project manager : the uh it 's made for s people well , the they do n't if it was uh uh r useless technology , they would n't put it uh as a possibility . industrial designer : uh solar cells are useless . project manager : and i it it th th the the target marketing : or the hand dynamo dynamo project manager : the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : because i think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . because it 's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot hey that maybe that 's cool that 's a cool thing about it , you know . you do n't use batteries . marketing : yeah , but but if we ca project manager : i 've never seen it before in a remote control . user interface : but then we could make a docking station . marketing : i do n't know if five minutes . project manager : no , we we we ca n't make a docking station anyway . marketing : that 's not true . project manager : yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one user interface : wow , w why no li marketing : we can make a docking station for two thirty . project manager : we can still make user interface : look at now , we got two industrial designer : fo for a docking station . marketing : two thirty . user interface : two thirty left . ca ca n't we make a docking station of that ? marketing : we can make a docking station . sure . industrial designer : with a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it . marketing : sure . user interface : i do n't know . marketing : the power device is is i i is very cheap . project manager : marketing : that 's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . project manager : yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . industrial designer : wi with a button to user interface : well , we we uh industrial designer : wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . uh , so it 's uh wireless technology . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , but we uh we do n't inc we have n't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff . i do n't think it 's realistic for you to do so . marketing : well then it 's a useless project . industrial designer : look at the case , project manager : oh , because we industrial designer : the case the case of of uh of uh user interface : yeah , then we do n't have any innovation things . project manager : we well look at all the special stuff we have . colour a the colours are special , the form is special . it th this is whole concept . uh maybe it with the kinetic thing , i think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . marketing : ca n't we uh ca n't we say fifteen euros ? project manager : uh , no . user interface : marketing : no , sta yeah i mean industrial designer : no , then we have to sell it for thirty euros . user interface : no , we only make less profit of it . industrial designer : it 's the marketing : you can sell for twenty seven and a half . then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . user interface : no . project manager : yeah , i don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a uh uh i i i i still fee i also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . marketing : i do n't think industrial designer : maybe we can uh can do it both . maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . battery and kinetic . project manager : no , that would n't n no . marketing : thirteen twenty . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : yeah , and it is also not a good it 's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you do n't want it to think about batteries anymore . marketing : and i think only industrial designer : yes , but when it 's then when it marketing : yeah , but only kinetic , then you got ta project manager : no no . industrial designer : then you have to shake it uh and all when it 's when it 's empty . project manager : yeah , it 's great . marketing : you you got ta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . industrial designer : project manager : no no no . no no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : when you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it industrial designer : you asked for three d no , that 's n that 's not true . uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . project manager : it we can make it yeah no . becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it industrial designer : yes , solar cells are also stated . project manager : yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . industrial designer : why do n't we use solar cells then ? project manager : because i think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when i move my remote control around and industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : yeah , it 's funny for a week . i guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . project manager : yeah , but you do n't have to . trust me . the idea of this technology is that you do n't think about it , it just happens . marketing : no , i i do n't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . project manager : okay , then we d okay , well y we do n't have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know . you m have to put something on your box . you have to make people buy it and uh we can really can do the docking thing , uh it 's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it 's would be a easy way out . industrial designer : you can do it for fifty cents . user interface : marketing : well , we 've got more than fifty cents . project manager : okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , industrial designer : the c the case the case alone is is is uh project manager : because uh we only have a minute left or so . industrial designer : the case alone for uh remote control is at least one euro . then we have one euro thirty for the whole docking station . project manager : no no , it 's not possible . okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it 's this is then then our concept is ready . user interface : cheap remote control . project manager : yeah , we make some extra profit of it . marketing : yeah . no , we wo n't , but that 's um something else . user interface : it w it wo n't tell , but industrial designer : but now marketing : no , this not gon na sell . no . project manager : huh , any ideas ? marketing : of course not . user interface : no , uh , n no industrial designer : great . it 's great . user interface : yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . you have to do it over . industrial designer : our remote control . marketing : we come back tomorrow , okay ? project manager : no no uh there 's still there 's still someth concept and something special left . user interface : yeah . the industrial designer : seventy euros . project manager : i mean we 're gon na it 's gon na excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel . user interface : no , but no . project manager : that 's what it 's makes it special . yeah , and i would li i would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and uh i know it will work , but uh it 's it 's an they 're they 're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . industrial designer : why not a hand dynamo then ? user interface : project manager : okay , well we leave it like this . then it 's c then we 're yeah . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : we ca n't do anything else . warning , finish meeting now ."
