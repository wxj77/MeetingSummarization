    "query": "<s> what did andrew clark think of the inconsistency with how admission offers were made concerning the skill challenge certificates ?",
    "answer": "hefin david am : but it will be presented to you as a submission from this committee , no doubt . let 's look at some admissions offers instead then . you do concede that there is inconsistency with how admissions offers are made with regard to the skills challenge certificate . how would you suggest that that is addressed ? andrew clark : could i just add to that response ? there are , obviously , differences in the way that universities treat the skills challenge certificate and the welsh baccalaureate , which is the prime focus of this . the attitude of the universities has changed significantly since that was a graded qualification . kirsty williams am : yes , that has made a difference ."
