    "query": "<s> how did the team reach an agreement to address potential problems with the joystick keyboard when discussing detailed designings of ideal remote control ?",
    "answer": "project manager : so perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . user interface : like yeah . project manager : but then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we user interface : yeah . marketing : true . user interface : it 's d yeah . i think it 's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . project manager : i feel like i 'm just shooting everything down here . user interface : marketing : that 's fine . project manager : uh um marketing : you 're the boss , you 're allowed to . industrial designer : well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . so if the remote is too small it marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : if it 's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . so for that there 's project manager : okay , so industrial designer : so project manager : unfortunately we 've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . um we 've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we 've got a couple ideas um . let 's see here . what if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . so you know um s so it 's easier to hold onto that way . user interface : yeah . project manager : course that 'll then remove some of our our ball . unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . so the grip is no , that would n't work either um . but if we 're gon na make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here i guess , um and then flat uh and then we have the problem with the hinge . so if we 're flat on the bottom , it 's not gon na roll away , it 'll stay where we want . industrial designer : the question is also , i dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? project manager : mm , that 's true . industrial designer : it 's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so i do n't know if a lid is a good idea . from stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . so it 's do n't make it too stable uh . project manager : so we do n't have it flip open . we just have a ball user interface : but then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . industrial designer : to the other design . project manager : okay , so then we forget the ball . industrial designer : it looks cool . marketing : looks cool though . project manager : it looks cool , but it 's really not it 's not functional um . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : uh functional . project manager : so we 've got our sort of keyboard kind . what if we flipped it around here , so that it were um sorry , that does n't look anything like what you had there . um so it 's up and down , you hold it this way . user interface : yeah . project manager : course then it 's it 's like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . marketing : industrial designer : right . right . project manager : but it 's one-handed um . industrial designer : question is what makes those game pads functional ? w i think that 's pretty much the form for full hand . so it 's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : right , makes it nice , so that 's the essential part . except for that i think we 'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design . project manager : yeah . marketing : right . industrial designer : 'cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : you know , all project manager : because it does n't have a cord , like joysticks do . industrial designer : that dif batteries right , and batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wan na control with it , right ? so , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . project manager : is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? so that either way you 're pointing it it would work . industrial designer : i suppose you could do that . o of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it 'll cost , so . project manager : more expensive and yeah . industrial designer : course you can do that . project manager : 'kay . um"
