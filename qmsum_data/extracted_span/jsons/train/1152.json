    "answer": "industrial designer : so which vegetable ? project manager : well i mean we could make a user interface : yeah , i know , carrot . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . project manager : well , si since we 're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , i think your lemon was n't that far s industrial designer : the the lemon . well what are the options ? user interface : yeah . project manager : and if it does n't work you know , we 've just made a lemon . user interface : but we do n't want it to be yeah . um the child-friendly , yeah . easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . i like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . project manager : mm-hmm . i like i like the colourful buttons as well . user interface : i think that 's a good idea to go for . yeah . and the mouse one , i thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . um . project manager : yeah . i mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , user interface : yeah . project manager : so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use . user interface : s yeah . so they 'd be able to use that um , as i said i think i i 'd presume it would come up on the screen . project manager : yeah . user interface : um so there you go . project manager : and that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the tv maker , so user interface : yeah . so that 's um the user interface project manager : 'kay . user interface : design . project manager : industrial designer : okay . user interface : so okay , i 'll take this out now then . project manager : user interface : there you go . industrial designer : i guess there are a lot of options that we 're gon na have to choose from among , project manager : yeah , looks like it . industrial designer : and i 'll i 'll give you the uh , i guess , technical considerations for those . project manager : uh industrial designer : and i 'm gon na use the whiteboard , just 'cause we have n't used it . project manager : yeah , i was just thinking the self same thing . user interface : industrial designer : right . so , the way i 'm gon na do this is uh we 're gon na take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , project manager : industrial designer : and then we 'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget . project manager : magic man . industrial designer : so uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . um this is what they sent me . 'kay . here 's uh the competition , i suppose . project manager : industrial designer : um you open it up , there 's a circuit board inside , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um and there 's a a chip , a processor , the t_a_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch project manager : so this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? industrial designer : right , it 's very they 're very cheap remote . this remote costs nothing , you know . um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the l_e_d_ light , which i can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . project manager : right . industrial designer : oh here it is . um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the uh project manager : okay . so can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? industrial designer : r um no , i mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . project manager : they got ta be almost a key-ring . industrial designer : right . so this is what we need to have for certain . project manager : okay . industrial designer : um . so you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what 's it gon na be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we 'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail i got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . so lots of choices , user interface : project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : what do we think ? uh or sponge , i guess , is n't on there , right . project manager : well . user interface : mm . i 'm not sure about the sponge . industrial designer : organic sponge . project manager : well , i mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , does n't it . industrial designer : uh yeah , it 's very elasticy for sure . project manager : um yeah . and that would k also give it kinda durability user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : and ther that 's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . industrial designer : yeah so project manager : um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? industrial designer : okay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex user interface : i like the rubber , the stress balls , i think , project manager : oh right , okay . user interface : you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it 's good to hold and industrial designer : oh right . project manager : i do n't know what that stuff is . industrial designer : so something with give to it . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . and user interface : and that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . industrial designer : and the colour is yellow , right ? user interface : yeah , project manager : or at least incorporating , yeah . user interface : y yellow incorporated , yeah . industrial designer : yellow , okay . um . project manager : i mean i forgot i we 're sort of uh i do n't know what other standard silver kind of user interface : i think project manager : other parts or uh user interface : mm . yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there 's gon na be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm ' kay . user interface : or i if we 're having buttons actually , industrial designer : so yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ? project manager : um i quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so multi-coloured buttons . user interface : you do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . project manager : yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it does n't look too childish , perhaps . user interface : makes it easy to use . yeah , that 's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . industrial designer : okay . project manager : yeah . although i mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . i mean if we are gon na make it a novel i mean double-curved sounds good to me if we 're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , industrial designer : okay . user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . yeah . project manager : a bit comfier , you know . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : mm 'kay so the shape we wan na go um how exactly ? maybe double user interface : like uh an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you 're thinking of , project manager : yeah it 's uh , yeah , that that 'd be that 's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you do n't drop it . user interface : or just like a it 's not industrial designer : what about a banana ? user interface : yeah . project manager : user interface : we could make novelty remote controls . industrial designer : yeah ? okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , project manager : well , yeah , i mean like industrial designer : 'cause it 's yellow fruit , user interface : industrial designer : right ? project manager : yeah , yeah . mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . yeah . user interface : yeah . but then how would you point it ? marketing : yeah . mm-hmm . user interface : how would you point it ? industrial designer : oh i it does n't matter which end you point , i guess . user interface : what industrial designer : we could have a little l_e_d_s on each end . marketing : yeah , i appreciate this idea , project manager : they only cost pennies . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : because then this this will help us in our advertisement also project manager : marketing : and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people 's choices . that what our data shows that , so this w this w user interface : yeah . y i 'm i 'm not sure about the banana idea . marketing : project manager : um . industrial designer : so a spongy banana re marketing : project manager : i mean that that th user interface : rubber banana . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : okay . project manager : it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay , okay . user interface : i think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . and what else did you say about fashions ? what was trendy ? marketing : uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , project manager : s industrial designer : see marketing : like people uh now project manager : and sponginess . industrial designer : so maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable user interface : and spongy , yeah . marketing : spongy . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : like so it would have a stem perhaps user interface : yeah . maybe , yeah . industrial designer : maybe a it 'd be s axially symmetric . user interface : like what 's what 's that , i do n't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it 's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . i do n't know the name of that . industrial designer : so it 'd look like this kinda . user interface : yeah , that 's what i was thinking . industrial designer : like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? user interface : yeah , maybe that 's what they are . 'cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit industrial designer : yeah , user interface : and industrial designer : and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , why the hell not . let 's that 'll make us fifty million euros . user interface : i do n't know . what do you guy what do you think ? industrial designer : project manager : um . well , i guess it 's kind of dra uh you do n't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , then only we can relate it with something . project manager : yeah , we can relate it by advertising or marketing : yeah . exactly . industrial designer : okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? project manager : yeah . marketing : or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . user interface : uh-huh . industrial designer : okay . project manager : there 's a good man . there 's a good idea . user interface : okay . industrial designer : okay um , i guess , since you 're the marketing guy . marketing : yeah , sure . i will be happy to do that . project manager : industrial designer : we 'll uh okay , we could do that . um . user interface : okay . and buttons would , did we say ? uh different shapes of buttons ? project manager : um i l i su i mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . industrial designer : okay , so project manager : they 've got , i mean , they 've got standard sort of intuitive um industrial designer : so buttons . project manager : things that are always used . industrial designer : okay , just like that . user interface : project manager : that 's cool . user interface : yeah . project manager : i like it . industrial designer : okay . project manager : um . industrial designer : with the scroll-wheel or no ? user interface : yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? project manager : uh speech recognition , i think , so we need a microphone presumably . industrial designer : okay uh i could put the microphone here . project manager : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay there 's the microphone . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : where should i put the microphone ? project manager : i mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? user interface : yeah , i 'm not sure . um i mean those ideas i saw were just for inspiration , i think . project manager : glad , we 're not doing this for real . user interface : um yeah , i can no i 'm not sure . industrial designer : okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? user interface : i couldn yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . project manager : and uh i think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone industrial designer : okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or project manager : i would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it 's yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : 'kay there 's the mic . project manager : so it can be sort of held and w user interface : that 's cool . industrial designer : project manager : we really need really gon na need to hold it , if it 's gon na be voice recognition . industrial designer : um n well we can whoops . project manager : oops . user interface : so let 's not use the whiteboard any more . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : marketing : industrial designer : um . marketing : project manager : upsidaisy . industrial designer : oops , sorry . okay . user interface : and uh so what else was there ? um the industrial designer : project manager : user interface : what about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? project manager : i s i still like it . user interface : are we just gon na leave that ? project manager : um but that 's me . user interface : you still like it . 'cause we 've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . industrial designer : right . project manager : yes , or maybe it 's just going a bit uh too far . i mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . user interface : 'cause um it could yeah . project manager : um do n't wan na sort of overkill . user interface : especially with yellow . mm . i dunno . project manager : 'cause i mean like uh if we i mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it 's a fruit ? user interface : then you put it in the fruit bowl ? industrial designer : they can work from a project manager : yeah , you know , and then you just tal industrial designer : you do n't have to hold it . project manager : i mean like everybody 's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : i it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , project manager : um . industrial designer : you know they have uh fruits all round them . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . make them make them think of fruit , yeah . industrial designer : now just make sure they do n't eat the remote . marketing : yeah . project manager : i mean uh some uh i user interface : yeah , do we need buttons ? project manager : l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , i dunno , an apple . then it 's just apple so sort of industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh , yellow apples though hmm . user interface : i quite like the shape . i quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it 's quite got a quite steady base . project manager : yeah . okay , yeah , that 's good . industrial designer : okay . but yeah project manager : groovy . user interface : and as we say we n we do n't wan na be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . project manager : yeah , . industrial designer : but yeah , about the speech thing , it does n't have to be hand held or close . it can sit at a distance and pick it up still . project manager : yeah . so i mean like you could actually user interface : okay . marketing : or we can project manager : yeah , gives you the options . marketing : we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so a selection of casings . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : it will look l uh yeah . in that w project manager : it kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um user interface : yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , marketing : s s sorry ? user interface : did n't you ? you said about disposable earli people want disposable things marketing : uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , user interface : so we could do that , like have a choice . yeah . marketing : okay ? if somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . project manager : like like mobiles , yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : if somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . it will give apple shape look . so in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , user interface : okay . okay . marketing : without uh yeah . user interface : we still need the buttons in the same places thought , marketing : yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . user interface : do n't we ? project manager : you can standardise those , i mean . marketing : yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , user interface : oh , that 's the other side . oh , okay . marketing : so half of that will be look the user interface : oh , half a fruit . oh , okay , okay . marketing : yeah , not not the upper side . so from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . user interface : okay , okay . marketing : so in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . industrial designer : yeah yeah . marketing : and project manager : i think tho i think if you 're gon na have a facia then you 'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , user interface : okay . project manager : 'cause when if you think about it if they 're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they 're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . it does n't really user interface : mm mm . project manager : you know 'cause that 'd be in the palm of their hand and they would n't be able to see it , user interface : yeah . project manager : unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . and you 've got the facia , and you can just talk at the user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : maybe . industrial designer : okay , um so marketing : project manager : so you 've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . industrial designer : yeah , marketing : industrial designer : s i guess we decided on material , right ? so that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and the colours we got down , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and the shape , maybe we 'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . well , um because well , i i 'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because i think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what project manager : okay , so we stick with what we 've got there . user interface : yeah , w i think wh wha would we 're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . they wanted something that looks fancy and i think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : because al already we 're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : i mean we could make it nice pale yellow . project manager : well , it 's kind of got ta be our company 's yellow . user interface : okay . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so again i mean like we could have , uh i mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different user interface : okay . yeah . project manager : colour , but have user interface : maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . project manager : kinda going round , yeah . um i mean e even if user interface : because project manager : i mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . user interface : yeah . project manager : so you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . user interface : yeah . yeah . uh-huh . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : w sort of industrial designer : great . um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we do n't have to be limited by that . we can use a hand-dynamo . um i do n't know what that means , we crank it ? project manager : uh it 's i think it 's basically the more you move i it , it 's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . industrial designer : right , it 's like those watches that you c project manager : uh yeah . industrial designer : so , this might be an idea for something that people really wan na grab , you can shake it if it 's out of power . user interface : oh , a d a dynamo ? marketing : yeah , . project manager : yeah , i like that , yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah that 's quite cool . industrial designer : okay . so if it if it 's not working , i guess people 's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . marketing : but project manager : okay . you shake it and scream at it . marketing : but but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , it is , yeah . marketing : because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat project manager : it does leave them with an obligation to marketing : yeah , to mo yeah . project manager : especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . marketing : yeah , industrial designer : right . marketing : because most of the people project manager : then if it 's just sitting on the user interface : yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , okay . industrial designer : okay . user interface : that 's true . project manager : right um what are the other options ? industrial designer : uh there 's solar power . um . marketing : uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : and the days when there is no sola sunlight project manager : i 'm i 'm with uh raj on that , industrial designer : okay , so probably just marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : i think , you know , marketing : what we w project manager : i 've got i 've got no i 've got a north facing house , there 's not really ever sun coming in my window . marketing : yeah . i think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . user interface : but w like just normal light ? project manager : oh that 's true . marketing : they can they can recharge it . project manager : i mean i w i w uh user interface : project manager : that idea that i thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a , user interface : and we 're a very environmentally friendly company , are n't we as well ? project manager : yeah , marketing : yeah . project manager : having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : 'kay . user interface : like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing . marketing : yeah , that 's yeah , exactly . project manager : yeah that kind of thing . industrial designer : okay . so uh a rechargeable battery . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . um the user interface , the buttons , i guess we talked about this already . project manager : rechargeable . . what 's chip on print ? what 's sorry , never mind ."
