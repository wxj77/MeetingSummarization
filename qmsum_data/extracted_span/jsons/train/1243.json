industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : well you can erase it with the eraser , but uh you should n't delete an entire page , but just create a new blank one . user interface : right . project manager : i will delete this one now because we do n't use it yet . user interface : alright . project manager : but you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but do n't uh delete entire pages . and you can also um let 's see i think it 's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five . um that 's what you will need for our first exercise , because i 'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : it 's also to gets to know each other because um i 'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing , industrial designer : okay . project manager : to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and i just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which i also showed you . um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word . well i 'm not very good at drawing , but i will uh go first and um try to draw user interface : project manager : or maybe you should guess what i 'm drawing , eh . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : good . user interface : marketing : no . user interface : it 's a sheep . industrial designer : user interface : industrial designer : seal , a seal . marketing : dinosaur . user interface : marketing : beaver . user interface : a beaver . industrial designer : a be project manager : well it uh user interface : it 's weird . project manager : could be everything . industrial designer : mm . with a tail and a mouth . project manager : maybe when i put on user interface : it has wings ? marketing : turtle . project manager : this thing it could be a turtle , or a snail , industrial designer : snail . user interface : well the snail does n't have legs . industrial designer : okay . project manager : but a turtle has . and those are slow . and i hope our project group will not be slow , industrial designer : project manager : but we will uh work to a good result industrial designer : project manager : and do it uh as fast as we can . okay , time for another animal . would you like to go next ? user interface : marketing : no problem . no problem . industrial designer : sure . user interface : oh right . marketing : mm . it was four months ? user interface : marketing : nice , okay . user interface : well . industrial designer : the hell . user interface : marketing : to make it a little bit easier . user interface : it 's a giraffe . industrial designer : make that cute . user interface : or a dinosaur . marketing : no , it 's a giraffe . 'kay . i think it 's easy to r uh to recognise as a giraffe . user interface : yes . giraffe . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah , the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything . and i hope i can also reach a lot with this project . so that 's my favourite animal . project manager : okay . marketing : anything else you need to know ? project manager : could you write the words , uh underneath it ? or more words . marketing : oh , uh industrial designer : tall . user interface : marketing : tall . so , user interface : should i uh marketing : 'kay . user interface : alright . so i can draw , but uh uh . well . oh . industrial designer : b marketing : it 's a mouse . user interface : industrial designer : bunny rabbit . marketing : a bunny rabbit . user interface : oh wrong one . uh . industrial designer : marketing : user interface : well uh you can guess what it is , i hope . marketing : uh-huh . no problem . project manager : little rabbits . user interface : it 's a rabbit . industrial designer : user interface : and uh well uh it 's uh quick , i guess . that 's uh my uh favourite animal . project manager : okay , thank you . industrial designer : okay . project manager : and our final drawing . user interface : marketing : bob ross . user interface : a dolphin . project manager : industrial designer : okay , um . marketing : dolphin . industrial designer : uh i uh draw i i 've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence . user interface : marketing : project manager : user interface : right . industrial designer : one of the most intelligent uh project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : animals in our world . user interface : well . industrial designer : yeah intelligent . user interface : with an e_ . project manager : industrial designer : i 've i 've uh user interface : industrial designer : eraser . project manager : user interface : you can try out the eraser now . project manager : industrial designer : pen . well not perfect , but okay . project manager : okay , well thank you very much . i can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group , industrial designer : user interface : not really . project manager : huh ? well , nice animals , nice words . sounds good . um back to business , back to the money part . um from the finance department i have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five euros . and we 're hoping for a aim of fifty million euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market . and the production cost will be twelve euro fifty max . okay , well it 's time uh for some discussion . i 've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about . uh what 's your experience with remote controls , um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments . uh well actually i 'd like to hand the word uh back to you . what 's your experience with remote control ? user interface : i always lose them . industrial designer : a lot of buttons . and you always lose them . marketing : yeah . user interface : yes . industrial designer : a lot of buttons which you do n't use user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : or who you do n't use marketing : complex . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : complex . not user friendly . user interface : search for the buttons , which one is which and uh marketing : boring . user interface : project manager : boring , it 's not fun to use a remote . marketing : black , all black . user interface : well . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : black colours . marketing : so , yeah . project manager : well maybe we should try to make it fun . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : they use batteries and batteries uh and poor signal . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . user interface : perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls . marketing : the the angle you have to use . you had different remote controls for different devices . industrial designer : yeah , different remote controls , user interface : yes , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : perhaps you can integrate them or something . industrial designer : uh for the use of different uh devices . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : your stereo and your tv marketing : yeah . user interface : and uh . perhaps that 's an idea . marketing : yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons , user interface : yeah , that 's right . and which you do n't use . marketing : so industrial designer : but you could uh i thin uh there 's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection user interface : right . industrial designer : so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em . marketing : yeah . yeah , okay , that 's possible , industrial designer : that 's possible , so that you only get the marketing : but it 'll get very big the the remote control . user interface : yeah . you should just give it to . industrial designer : no n n no , just uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday , but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in dutch . uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : changing channel . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : or uh the numbers , of course . marketing : mm-hmm . numbers . industrial designer : but uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television . marketing : on and off . industrial designer : you only use those uh the first time , or . marketing : yeah , industrial designer : so . uh . marketing : play , pause , stop . project manager : mm-hmm . so maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons . industrial designer : yeah , i think so , yeah . user interface : yes . but you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . because uh things for uh teletext , i dunno uh , w marketing : mm-hmm , of course . industrial designer : yeah , uh teletext . marketing : user interface : what 's the name ? project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : think so . okay . project manager : so you do n't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons so they do n't have to get out of their seat . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : but industrial designer : right . marketing : because i think a market will be all kind of people . elderly p el elderly , young people , so . user interface : but if if it 's if it 's international you should uh look in think in britain they have uh different things they can do with the tv , or so uh that you can choose what you want to see . i dunno if you should uh take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal tvs that uh industrial designer : yeah i i understand . marketing : yeah i think that 's the better one , user interface : and the b_b_c_ . marketing : because i think if you you 're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only britain then i think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty , i think . industrial designer : no . user interface : yes . yeah , i do n't know if the they have that anywhere else , though . marketing : i think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and britain , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , we can leave that . industrial designer : when i think of it uh marketing : not that much . industrial designer : i think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh to make it user friendly . so uh i think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm . standard deliver . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : it only has to have uh the most used buttons . you do n't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television . in those in that marketing : no but user interface : but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search . marketing : yeah . yeah , th it it 's i think that 's not user interface : that 's not industrial designer : yeah but i but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control . it 's impossible . user interface : yeah , that 's right . marketing : yeah , okay . industrial designer : because uh for example sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . uh user interface : yeah that 's uh . marketing : i think n m n most televisions nowadays do this . industrial designer : yeah , but uh they do n't use the same signal , uh on remote control . user interface : well not everywhere . marketing : so i think numerals . industrial designer : because you ca n't use a panasonic uh remote control on a on a philips television . marketing : yeah , but then you have to choose the always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . user interface : yeah , you can choose the code . industrial designer : okay . okay . okay . okay , marketing : you can use which which type of television you have . that 's no problem . but i think like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that 's that 's nowadays standard , i think . industrial designer : but uh i think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one marketing : simplicity . industrial designer : or the first one is broken , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television , marketing : yeah , yeah . mm-hmm . industrial designer : so that option is not uh optional for those uh people . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah g available . user interface : but the people have a new television , marketing : true . user interface : and c if you look into the future , then they want will want the button , if their thing is broke . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so we should take that in consideration . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . okay , well marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : any more ideas ? user interface : industrial designer : oh mm , no . user interface : guess not . marketing : of course . industrial designer : things 'll come up . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , yeah well we have some time . let 's see what more i have to tell you . i do n't think there is much left . nope . we 're starting to close . um our next meeting uh will start well we 're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : in the meantime uh there 's time for some uh individual actions . um , as you can see , the different roles have uh different tasks . and there 's a ping . user interface : project manager : is it my laptop ?
