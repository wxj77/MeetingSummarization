    "query": "<s> summarize the debate about the flaws in government ` s pandemic relief program .",
    "answer": "hon . andrew scheer ( leader of the opposition ) : thank you very much , mr . chair . when the government first starting rolling out programs to help canadians get through this pandemic , we raised points about some flaws and gaps in the program . the government assured canadians that it would fix these programs as time went on . well , canadians are suffering through both the health and the economic consequences of the lockdown related to the coronavirus . here we are the first day of june and the government still has yet to address the flaws in its programs ; it is still letting so many canadians down . i have a series of very straightforward and specific questions . on april 20 we raised with the minister of finance the issue of companies that had purchased another company not being able to demonstrate revenue loss , and therefore not being eligible for the wage subsidy , even though both companies separately would have been able to do just that . we have raised it several times now . i would like to ask the government when it will be fixing this unnecessarily rigid aspect of the wage subsidy program . hon . chrystia freeland ( deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs ) : mr . chair , i believe that a company with a fantastic canadian history in the member 's riding , brandt tractor , which pioneered the manufacturing of augers in canada , is particularly affected by this . it is very important for us that the wage subsidy be available to as many canadian companies as possible . it helps to keep employees connected to their businesses . now , there are always some specific issues that can make it challenging for particular companies . i know that in the case of brandt tractor , for example , officials from the ministry of finance are directly in touch with the company to work on its issues . hon . andrew scheer : mr . chair , that 's the same answer we got last week . it 's the same answer we got two weeks before that , and it 's the same answer we have been getting from day one . this is a very simple question . the government has indicated that it will change this program to allow for amalgamations . the solution is very simple . it is to also allow for those companies that have undergone acquisitions . this is a very specific question : will the government fix this program and allow for companies that have acquired another company to still access the wage subsidy program ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , let me just point out that the wage subsidy program is working extremely well for many , many canadian companies and for many , many canadians who are able to keep their jobs thanks to the program . more than two million canadian workers are today benefiting from the wage subsidy program . by any measure that is a successful program . now , for sure there are always going to be companies which , because of specifics in their history , need specific attention , and that the chair : we 'll go back to mr. scheer . hon . andrew scheer : mr . chair , reports indicate that up to half of the money allocated for the wage subsidy is going unspent , precisely because this government has left in unnecessarily rigid barriers for companies to be able to access it . it 's a yes-or-no question , and the minister still ca n't answer it . along the same lines , we asked on april 8 to allow businesses applying for the wage subsidy to demonstrate their 30 % revenue loss using other metrics , such as loss of earnings , subscriptions and orders , in order to qualify . they still ca n't do that today , the first day of june . why has n't the government addressed this part of the program ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , we are very proud of the wage subsidy program and proud of the role it is playing to keep canadian businesses going and , crucially , to keep canadian workers connected to their jobs , but i have a question for the member opposite . half of the questions we hear from the conservatives in question period are concerns that we 're spending too much money , that the deficit is too high . the other half of the time they complain about specific companies not getting access to our programs . we know which side we 're on as a government . i 'd like the conservatives to let canadians know what they believe in . the chair : mr. scheer , you may have a short question . hon . andrew scheer : mr . chair , it 's quite clear what conservatives believe in . we believe that when times were good , this government should have paid down debt instead of wasting money like $ 50 million to mastercard and $ 12 million to loblaws . the fact of the matter is that the government left canadians in a vulnerable position as we were entering this pandemic precisely because of its fiscal irresponsibility , and now they have designed programs that have unnecessary barriers in them that prevent more and more canadians from getting the help they need . again , on april 26 , conservatives asked the prime minister to change the criteria for the canada emergency business account so that small businesses that do n't happen to have a business bank account can qualify . why has n't the prime minister made that change either ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , i 'm really grateful for that question because it allows me to set the record straight for canadians . canadians need to know that our country has the lowest debt-to-gdp ratio in the g7 . we had that before the crisis began , and we still do . canada has the fiscal firepower to support canadians during this unprecedented crisis , and that is what we are going to continue to do . the chair : mrs.debellefeuille . mrs. claude debellefeuille ( salaberrysurot , bq ) : mr.chair , the wage subsidy was put in place to support businesses and smes , to avoid closures and bankruptcy . have i missed something ? is the liberal party on the verge of bankruptcy ? is it about to shut down ? does the prime minister consider that the liberal party is getting ready to close its doors ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i thank the hon . member for the question . i want to point out that , as the hon . member said , the wage subsidy was really put in place to protect workers across canada . we are proud of that . more than 2million canadians have benefited from this the chair : mrs.debellefeuille , you have the floor . mrs. claude debellefeuille : mr.chair , the liberal party made $ 3million between january and march of this year . that 's $ 3million in political donations . we 're told that the emergency subsidy is being used to protect the jobs of liberal party employees . i 'm not an accountant , but i can count . i 'm wondering why the liberal party does n't use its own money to pay its own employees instead of using the canada emergency wage subsidy . hon . chrystia freeland : i thank the hon . member for her question . i would like to point out again that the purpose of the canada emergency wage subsidy is to support workers across canada and quebec , to help them keep their jobs and allow them to stay connected to their workplace . that is what we 've done . more than 2million canadians are benefiting from this important and truly essential program for our country . we are proud of it . mrs. claude debellefeuille : mr.chair , does the deputy prime minister think it is moral , fair and honest that employees who have lost their jobs are subsidizing an emergency wage subsidy for the liberal party of canada out of their taxes ? hon . chrystia freeland : our programs do not discriminate . they are there to help all workers . the hon . member talked about businesses and sectors that need more help . we agree . there is still a lot to do , but we want to work with all the the chair : mrs.debellefeuille . mrs. claude debellefeuille : mr.chair , many struggling businesses in quebec do n't have access to the canada emergency wage subsidy because they do n't meet the eligibility criteria . many tourism and municipal organizations , among others , do n't have access to this wage subsidy . however , it 's very clear that the liberal party qualifies according to the program criteria . does the deputy prime minister really think it 's moral for her party to benefit from the emergency wage subsidy when it has the financial means to pay its own employees ? hon . chrystia freeland : i thank the hon . member for her question . i agree that there is still a lot to do . we are ready , and we are taking action . however , it 's important to point out that our government has already done a lot to support canadians . we 've spent $ 152billion in direct support measures to canadians . more than eightmillion people are benefiting from the cerb , and more than twomillion the chair : mrs.debellefeuille , you have the floor . mrs. claude debellefeuille : mr.chair , what i understand is not really complicated to understand . i understand that the liberal party has money , that it has money to pay its employees , but that it does n't want to cut the booty it has amassed for the next election . it 's as if it were telling us that it 's indirectly financing itself for the next election . will the deputy prime minister show some leadership and convince her own party to give up the emergency wage subsidy and even commit to paying back the money it has already received ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i want to point out that our programs do not discriminate . they are there to help all workers across the country , and i want to point out to what extent our programs do that . eight million people are currently benefiting from the cerb , and two million are supported by the emergency wage subsidy . our programs are also helping 380,000students and 639,000businesses the chair : we 'll now continue with mr. singh . mr. jagmeet singh ( burnaby south , ndp ) : thank you very much , mr . chair . canadians and people across the world are reeling after seeing the images of george floyd being brutally killed in a callous and casual manner . we 're struggling with the impacts of anti-black racism . anti-black racism has n't just appeared or increased . it 's now simply being captured by video . canada is also no different . anti-black racism also impacts canada , and people here are feeling the frustration of black lives being neglected and ignored . will the government commit to tracking race-based data in terms of covid-19 's impact on communities , particularly black canadians , and track race-based data so that we can have a better response based on the evidence ?"
