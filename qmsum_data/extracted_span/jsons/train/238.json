    "answer": "industrial designer : um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-r_s_i_ . it 's like the same sort of rubber that 's used in stress balls and things like that , so it 's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : wood . project manager : industrial designer : um , again , stepping back in time again there . user interface : industrial designer : i do n't think that 's quite up to date with what we 're looking for here . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : um , titanium is not gon na be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . but , would 've been maybe for future projects . um right our choice for buttons as well . we 've developed some we 've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . i think that was brought up for , um , they 're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you do n't have to use individual buttons . you can just slide up and down . i 'm sure we 're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads . rubber casing i thing would probably the best , if we 're going for the anti-r_s_i_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . like it could be pretty much any colour we want . um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . and probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , marketing : industrial designer : then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no lcd , 'cause we probably ca n't afford that one . project manager : yeah . um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : like as the exterior . this is the one thing that 's protecting its innards . industrial designer : i think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . and the rubber would just be the , what 's in contact with the human . project manager : yeah . another thing is it might be more difficult if it 's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um , is it industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i do n't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . it would work that way . industrial designer : maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . so , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . user interface : like plastic with rubber , kind of on top industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : like i ca n't think of what . user interface : well , there 's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . or like an user interface : b like a nokia it is . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : you can get sort of outer casing for ipods and something , that 's just it 's protective as well . user interface : it 's yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : like the skin ? industrial designer : it , it stops it , i mean , marketing : yeah ."
