    "answer": "project manager : 'kay . alright . now we have courtney with the functional requirements . marketing : yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . seventy five percent think they 're ugly . eighty percent want they 've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really i mean there 's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . user interface : wait . marketing : so that 's really what we need to do . and we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . so user interface : and that meaning what ? marketing : like they like i guess use the buttons a lot . user interface : okay . marketing : yeah . i do n't know . it 's from my uh research . project manager : okay , what do you m user interface : right . marketing : my team was n't very clear . project manager : oh , i 'm sorry . user interface : only use ten percent of the buttons . project manager : what do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . marketing : that 's okay . i i think it 's like the engineering versus user , project manager : okay . marketing : whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex project manager : oh , right . marketing : and users do n't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . project manager : the buttons . okay . industrial designer : project manager : yeah . okay . industrial designer : we only use ten per cent of our brains . user interface : marketing : good point . project manager : it works . marketing : it 's a necessary evil . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : ready for the next slide ? marketing : mm-hmm . and so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , much like any small appliance like a cellphone , user interface : lost . marketing : and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it 's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we do n't want to go we do n't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , but i mean they do need to be able to identify it , and r_s_i_ , i 'm not very sure what that is . project manager : it 's okay . it 's very important . marketing : yes , it is important for the remote control world . project manager : user interface : wait , is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? project manager : could be , yeah . marketing : uh possibly . industrial designer : do we really need t to provide more information on what r_s_i_ is ? user interface : like marketing : uh yeah , that 's what my web site said , i user interface : channel , volume , power . project manager : i think that 's a pretty good guess though . marketing : do n't know . user interface : marketing : yeah , i would assume so . user interface : it 's like if you 're holding it marketing : i think we 're supposed to know it as remote control experts . project manager : yeah . it 's okay . marketing : but also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . project manager : okay . next slide ? marketing : yes . and so personally i think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . so saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , i think that we should go with something that 's more user-friendly . project manager : user-friendly . marketing : where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . and it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a d_v_d_ player , a tivo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . so we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . and also we found our team found that speech recognition is it 's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . project manager : and so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? marketing : i guess so , yeah . user interface : project manager : okay . user interface : to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . project manager : oh , that 'd be lovely . marketing : yeah , i guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . user interface : yeah . project manager : did n't they um did n't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the tv and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it user interface : it 's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . project manager : mm . oh , yeah , that 's true . user interface : you know like go to the base . project manager : we could definitely include that if we wanted to . user interface : yeah ."
