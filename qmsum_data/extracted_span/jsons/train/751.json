    "query": "<s> what did dr. david blaney think of the impact of brexit on the capacity of wales ' higher education system ?",
    "answer": "john griffiths am : we certainly do not expect you to enter the political fray in any way . dr david blaney : thank you . but even in terms of your assessment of whether this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing , a good impact or a bad impact , some of that inevitably in the end becomes a matter of your politics on it , so we will be as careful as we can be on that . in terms of the impact of brexit on higher education , clearly , the significance here is about the contribution that higher education can make to wales . so , we fund provision ; we do n't fund providers , technically , although obviously there 's not much provision without providers . so , we are interested in the sustainability of higher education providers , but fundamentally the issue is : what does the he system in wales do for wales , and what impact might brexit have on the capacity of the system to continue to deliver for wales ? so , we know that universities make annually about \u00a35 billion of impact ; 50,000 jobs . of course , in wales , all of that economic impact is really very significant , and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment . that has an impact in a number of ways . we can identify at the moment the extent to which the he sector in wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the eu , so eu students , structural funds , and eu research funding , and so on , from the eu . we can identify some of that , but , actually , what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about . we are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from eu students and i 'll ask bethan to share some details on that in a moment . we 're also beginning to pick up , only anecdotally , some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the uk sector , and the welsh sector as part of that , in playing in some of the eu collaborative research activities . and that , i think , just reflects the extent to which eu partners consider that british partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period . we do n't have data on that\u2014that 's anecdotal\u2014but there are signs that some of those relationships are beginning to become a little bit more difficult . in terms of the financial impact of that , clearly , if it is accepted that the uk is a net contributor to the eu then , presumably , some of the money\u2014we 're almost immediately straight into politics if you 're not careful\u2014but some of the money will be available back to the uk , and the extent to which wales benefits or not from that returned money is a function of the political relationship between the welsh government and her majesty 's government . it 's not necessarily the case that wales will always lose out in that relationship , but that will become a matter of politics . there 's a broader dimension , which is about the economic impact of brexit on the uk economy and how much tax revenue there is and all of that . i think it 's very hard for us to be definitive about how that 's going to play out . i think that depends on the deal and how it all unfolds over the next several years . but we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen . we can touch later on on the extent to which they are sighted on this and preparing for it . so , in terms of recruitment , bethan ."
