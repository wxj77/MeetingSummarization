    "answer": "user interface : i think so , yeah . yeah , that 's the one . so , it 's a very short presentation , 'cause i 'm actually gon na draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of marketing : user interface : i took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which i completely agree with christine 's idea to have it sort of molded , so it 's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . industrial designer : right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example . user interface : so , that 's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . um , one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , marketing : user interface : so that you do n't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they 're not pressing the buttons while you 're trying to watch a tv show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : and also um you had issues with the batteries running out , marketing : user interface : so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . and in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so , in terms of what this thing would actually look like marketing : user interface : despite working in interface design , i 'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you 'll have to forgive me . you 'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you do n't accidentally turn your tv off while you 're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . and then here you 'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your tv project manager : user interface : and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . so that if the user does n't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you do n't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . industrial designer : mm . mm-hmm . user interface : um , so again you can have a little lcd light somewhere , the flip thing and have i forgotten anything ? i do n't think so . so , as you can see , it 's a very very simple design , marketing : no . project manager :"
