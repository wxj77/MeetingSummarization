    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about ideas about timescales for setting out what approach would be to handling the lack of exams .",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : if we can move on to talk about exams , obviously you made the announcement yesterday . i completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation , but , as you know , there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who 've put a lot of work in . are you able to tell us any more today ? in particular , have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams ? kirsty williams am : yes , it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken , but i have done so on the very , very clear and unambiguous advice from qualifications wales . i met with qualifications wales and the wjec yesterday . what was most important to them was that i made an early decision and i did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams . i was able to make an informal decision at that meeting , and then , of course , there is a formal process that we have to go through . that , now , allows qualifications wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision , and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work . we are trying , as far as we can , as i understand it , to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day , for instance . it might not be possible , because , of course , we 're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it , and those human beings could find themselves unwell . so , our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in august , but that has to be caveated by the fact that we 're dealing with difficult circumstances . but , the wjec and qualifications wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next . lynne neagle am : okay . janet , you had a question on this . janet finch-saunders am : yes , i think i raised it yesterday , kirsty , but you were receiving loads of questions . i 'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework , because only 30 per cent of that is done . years 11 and 13 , typically , in my case they 're what 's been raised with me\u2014do you have any advice for them ? kirsty williams am : okay , so , all exams are cancelled , but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade\u2014i think that 's a distinction that people need to be aware of . that is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications , and they are points of movement in the education system . so , it 's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next , whether that be university , whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form , into a college , into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities . that 's why we have to focus on those children , because for them , it is absolutely critical that we do . we are at an advantage in wales , can i say ? because of the nature of our examination system , those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on . because we 've kept our as-levels , we have got that data . because we have a gcse system\u2014 . our year 11s , if they 're doing triple science , they 've already done 40 per cent of their paper , so we 're very fortunate . because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system , there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use , alongside , potentially , teacher evaluation of students as well . and i think that 's really important . we \u2019 re starting from a better base than simply having none of that externally-verified data . what will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications , and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within wales , and i know that qualifications wales are discussing with their counterparts across the uk a modulated system across the uk . so , actually , we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the uk . so , we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade . so , they can have real confidence . lynne neagle am : okay . helen mary . helen mary jones am : thank you . a supplementary question that might feed into that moderation . you 'll know that the national union of students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class , on the whole , do n't do as well , in terms of their assessment by their own teachers . i do n't know what their evidence is for that . we also know , of course , that boys tend to do better in exams , and girls tend to do better at coursework , for whatever reason that is . so , just to ask you at this early stage to build in those considerations around potential unconscious bias into that overall system that you 're talking about . and , of course , you are right to say that , because we have got some elements of external moderation here , those factors may be less for us in wales than they might for colleagues in england . kirsty williams am : yes , i think we are starting at a different base , thank goodness . so , you 're quite right . as i said , students will have done unit 1 papers last year if they 're gcse students . dare i say it , some might even have done early entry . so , we still have elements of coursework that are externally verified . so , children might well have done lots of oral exams in their english and in their welsh language . so , we have lots of pieces of work that will have been externally verified . i certainly will ensure that these concerns are passed on . i 'm sure that qualifications wales are thinking about it . i have every confidence that they and the wjec will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades , but i have to say , in some ways , i have to step back now , because you would not expect me , in normal circumstances , to dictate to the wjec how much percentage goes for that , and how much percentage is allocated for that ; that would not be appropriate for a minister . my job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable , and i have confidence that that will be the case . helen mary jones am : thank you . suzy davies am : a few things from me . one is , obviously , pupils are being asked to work at home as well now , some of whom will be doing gcse and a-level courses . so , there 's just a question , generally , from me\u2014 because we 're encouraging these kids to carry on working\u2014how that will be accommodated by qualifications wales , i guess , in this modulation process . it may be that your at-home work will be of a higher standard or a lower standard than a teacher would be expecting . secondly , you mentioned the as-levels , of course , as being of value at the moment , but we 've got people in year 12 who now wo n't be doing their ass . is there any steer at this stage about what they will be expected to do ? will they be doing two sets of exams next year , for example ? or is as just off the table ? in which case , how are the a2s going to be calculated in due course ? and then , finally from me , we do have some vocational qualifications that are up for examination as well\u2014your btecs , and i think it 's the association of accounting technicians , which is a lot of computer-based learning\u2014which is due to be examined within three weeks . those aren \u2019 t a-levels or gcses . i appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment , but are they off as well is the question , i guess ? kirsty williams am : with regard to as-levels\u2014no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated . there are a range of options that could be used , but again , we will want to be thinking about student well-being , fairness and equity in that regard , and i will update members as soon as i have received definitive advice from qualifications wales around that , and that has n't happened yet . with regard to other types of qualifications , as you will be aware , the vast majority of btecs is a modular , continually-assessed piece of work , and we would have every expectation that btecs will be able to be awarded , but clearly , those conversations are with awarding bodies\u2014they tend to be uk awarding bodies , rather then necessarily our wjec exam board\u2014and those conversations are ongoing . but i have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and , of course , because of their nature there 's even more evidence of continued assessment . huw , i do n't know if there 's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications . huw morris : no . i think you 've covered most of it . i do n't have a definitive answer for the att qualification , but we can look into that and come back to you . suzy davies am : well , i 've just had a constituent ask , so that would be very helpful . and homeworking\u2014 kirsty williams am : homeworking , right . suzy davies am : \u2014is that going to count towards the assessments , overall assessments ? kirsty williams am : well , potentially , as i said . i do n't know the exact elements . what will be absolutely necessary is that qualifications wales and the wjec will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at , because parents , teachers and students will want to know that , and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades . suzy davies am : that 's great . at least we covered it . thank you , minister\u2014thank you , kirsty . lynne neagle am : and , just before we move on , have the universities across the uk indicated that they are content with this approach going forward\u2014content to accept students on this basis ? kirsty williams am : certainly . there have been discussions with universities and ucas , of course , that this also has a bearing on . one of the\u2014 . and the views of university and how university terms might be impacted is one of the ways and one of the reasons that we 've factored in to making these decisions . those discussions with universities are ongoing , are n't they , huw ?"
