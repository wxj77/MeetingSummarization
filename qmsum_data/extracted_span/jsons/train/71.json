    "answer": "professor c : cuz actually mississippi state people did use support vector machines for uh uh speech recognition and they were using it to estimate probabilities . grad a : yeah . yeah . yeah , they they had a had a way to translate the distances into into probabilities with the with the simple um uh sigmoidal function . professor c : yeah , and d did they use sigmoid or a softmax type thing ? grad a : um yeah , professor c : and did n't they like exponentiate or something grad a : there 's some there 's like one over one plus the exponential or something like that . professor c : and then divide by the sum of them , or ? oh it i oh , so it is a sigmoidal . grad a : yeah . professor c : ok . alright . phd e : did the did they get good results with that ? professor c : i mean , they 're ok , i i do n't i do n't think they were earth earth shattering , but i think that uh this was a couple years ago , i remember them doing it at some meeting , and and um i do n't think people were very critical because it was interesting just to to try this and you know , it was the first time they tried it , so so the you know , the numbers were not incredibly good but there 's you know , it was th reasonable . phd e : mm - hmm ."
