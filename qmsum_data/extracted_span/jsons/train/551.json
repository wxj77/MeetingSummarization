    "answer": "project manager : okay . um welcome to our second meeting . this is the functional design meeting . and i hope you all had a good individual working time . okay , let 's get started . okay , here 's the agenda for the meeting . after the opening um i am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . and we 're gon na have three presentations , one from each of you . then we 're gon na discuss some new project requirements . um gon na come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . and then we 're gon na close up the meeting . and we 're gon na do this all in about forty minutes . okay . first i want to discuss the goals of this meeting . first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . and then we 're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . and then lastly we 're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that 's the whole technical side of 'kay i 'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you 're making some notes . user interface : project manager : 'kay . oh , well let 's go ahead and , user interface : project manager : back , previous . user interface : project manager : so what i wan na do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . who would like to start us off ? 'kay . user interface : i do n't mind going first . project manager : okay . um do you have a powerpoint or no ? user interface : yeah , it 's in the should be in the m project . project manager : okay . marketing : do you want us to do our powerpoints now or user interface : you know you could you could do it yourself actually . industrial designer : did you send it ? project manager : save it in the project documents . user interface : put it in project documents , project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-mm-mm . this one ? user interface : sure . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . great . user interface : okay . um well , the function of a remote control , as what uh we 've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it 's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . and then functions for v_h_s_ , d_v_d_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . and enter would be for like , you know , the menus . and then other menus for d_v_ as well as tv , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . and we can decide if that 's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that 's something that would stay on the tv itself , for example . project manager : okay . okay . user interface : these are two examples . um and you can see on the left , it 's got a lot more buttons , project manager : user interface : and i do n't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . and then on the right , it 's a lot more simpler , it 's got volume , it 's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it 's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . so you have functions that are d uh duplicating . project manager : right . user interface : and you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . so that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . okay . project manager : ready . user interface : and then lastly , it 's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? and what functions it needs to complete . uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that 's something that also has to be considered and it 's gon na be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . so that 's it . project manager : alright . very good presentation . thank you . you speak with such authority on the matter . user interface : mm . left . project manager : okay . who would like to um follow that one up ? now , that we 've discussed marketing : i can go . project manager : okay . do you want me to run it or you wan na marketing : yeah , you should run it . project manager : okay . functional requirements . marketing : mm yes . project manager : 'kay . alright . now we have courtney with the functional requirements . marketing : yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . seventy five percent think they 're ugly . eighty percent want they 've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really i mean there 's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . user interface : wait . marketing : so that 's really what we need to do . and we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . so user interface : and that meaning what ? marketing : like they like i guess use the buttons a lot . user interface : okay . marketing : yeah . i do n't know . it 's from my uh research . project manager : okay , what do you m user interface : right . marketing : my team was n't very clear . project manager : oh , i 'm sorry . user interface : only use ten percent of the buttons . project manager : what do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . marketing : that 's okay . i i think it 's like the engineering versus user , project manager : okay . marketing : whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex project manager : oh , right . marketing : and users do n't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . project manager : the buttons . okay . industrial designer : project manager : yeah . okay . industrial designer : we only use ten per cent of our brains . user interface : marketing : good point . project manager : it works . marketing : it 's a necessary evil . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : ready for the next slide ? marketing : mm-hmm . and so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , much like any small appliance like a cellphone , user interface : lost . marketing : and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it 's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we do n't want to go we do n't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , but i mean they do need to be able to identify it , and r_s_i_ , i 'm not very sure what that is . project manager : it 's okay . it 's very important . marketing : yes , it is important for the remote control world . project manager : user interface : wait , is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? project manager : could be , yeah . marketing : uh possibly . industrial designer : do we really need t to provide more information on what r_s_i_ is ? user interface : like marketing : uh yeah , that 's what my web site said , i user interface : channel , volume , power . project manager : i think that 's a pretty good guess though . marketing : do n't know . user interface : marketing : yeah , i would assume so . user interface : it 's like if you 're holding it marketing : i think we 're supposed to know it as remote control experts . project manager : yeah . it 's okay . marketing : but also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . project manager : okay . next slide ? marketing : yes . and so personally i think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . so saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , i think that we should go with something that 's more user-friendly . project manager : user-friendly . marketing : where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . and it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a d_v_d_ player , a tivo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . so we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . and also we found our team found that speech recognition is it 's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . project manager : and so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? marketing : i guess so , yeah . user interface : project manager : okay . user interface : to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . project manager : oh , that 'd be lovely . marketing : yeah , i guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . user interface : yeah . project manager : did n't they um did n't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the tv and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it user interface : it 's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . project manager : mm . oh , yeah , that 's true . user interface : you know like go to the base . project manager : we could definitely include that if we wanted to . user interface : yeah . project manager : if it 's within our price . okay . are we ready for our last presentation , amber ? industrial designer : yeah , i 'm just trying to move it . project manager : okay . industrial designer : 'kay . i think it should be there , working design . user interface : working design . project manager : there we go . user interface : project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : 'kay . uh i did n't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that i was given were frustrating . project manager : oh my bad . marketing : oh that 's fine . industrial designer : uh okay , so method method of our design , i think i just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . user interface : help me . industrial designer : we need a power source , we 're gon na need a smart chip if we 're gon na make it multi-functional . um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart . user interface : marketing : what exactly is a smart chip ? industrial designer : usually a smart chip is just a chip that 's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . user interface : well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? is that gon na push us over our production costs ? industrial designer : i would n't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . and they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : okay . ready ? industrial designer : um yep , nothing here . project manager : that 's okay . user interface : industrial designer : um power source , i figured , batteries , 'cause they 're easily available . typically a remote has either two double a_s or four triple a_s , sometimes three . uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . um a large on-off button , demographically we 're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . user interface : industrial designer : selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the d_v_d_ player or the tv or the stereo system . um smart chip that perverts uh that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that 'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that 's kinda it . uh this is my fifty second design . user interface : industrial designer : power source over here . we 're gon na have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you 're gon na need the switch . um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . marketing : so what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? industrial designer : this is just like a rough schematic . project manager : so this would be the front ? industrial designer : so this is the internal workings . project manager : so the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? marketing : oh okay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah , that 's gon na be what 's communicating with the tv , but the other bulb , i think , is good to just to indicate , i 'm doing something , it 's sort of like a reassurance . project manager : the l the light up kind of industrial designer : yeah , so you do n't have to stare at that infra-red , marketing : like that we know the battery 's working . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when i push this button , is it working ? project manager : hmm . it 'd probably be lighting up the key too , marketing : okay . industrial designer : we can skip that whole thing . project manager : right ? 'kay . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so you can put it in the dark . project manager : the buttons . marketing : yeah , and that 's good . project manager : okay . marketing : we should make it glow in the dark . project manager : yeah , definitely . 'kay nex r ready ? industrial designer : yeah , that 's it . project manager : 'kay , any p 'kay ? user interface : marketing : mm 'kay . project manager : anything you wan na add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . anything else ? industrial designer : i think that that 's a good idea , because you know that 's one of the most important buttons . user interface : just project manager : okay . user interface : well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that i had , they were swi quite small . so should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? marketing : i think we should . like i think that would be in a as in like in for the design , sorry , um . i think we should definitely go with buttons that do n't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , i think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles . user interface : ovals . yeah , yeah . project manager : okay . okay , let 's talk about all of our we 'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let 's um wrap up this one , and i 'm gon na go back to my powerpoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might 've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . wait , come back . alright . sorry , let 's go through this . alright . here we go . new product requirements . first it 's only going to be a tv remote . we 're trying not to over-complicate things . so no d_v_d_ , no tivo , no stereo . industrial designer : okay . project manager : it 's not gon na be multi-functional . hey . and we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . we 're trying to get our name out there in the world . okay . and you know what teletext is ? user interface : yeah . project manager : in states we do n't have it , but um it 's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , user interface : i know . marketing : what is it ? user interface : project manager : it 's very um bland looking , it 's just text on the screen , user interface : yeah , project manager : not even user interface : it 's like black , black and white kind of project manager : yeah , just black with just text . marketing : like running along the bottom ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : you can also get the kind of the tv guide so user interface : it 'll give you the sports . marketing : wait , is it like the weather channel where it 's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? project manager : kind of . user interface : except the entire screen . project manager : yeah it 's the whole screen . industrial designer : it 's the entire screen is just running information at random . project manager : so anyway user interface : you can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , industrial designer : seemingly . user interface : you know it 's like project manager : right . marketing : so it 's like a separate channel from like what you 're watching ? project manager : right . but it 's becoming out-dated now , because of the internet . user interface : yeah . project manager : nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so those are our new product requirements . alright . mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay . marketing : okay . industrial designer : so , do we have to include the company colour within that ? project manager : yes . it 's part of the logo . okay . user interface : company colour being yellow . project manager : what we 're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we 'll close up the meeting . so . alright . whatever . okay . so our target group is you mentioned um older people ? would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : because i think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically user interface : it 's gon na make it nicer . yeah . project manager : non-technically challenged people are gon na use it . i mean they want something user-friendly , so industrial designer : mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : 'cause they 're saying they only use ten per cent of them , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . project manager : okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , i mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right ? or kids ? marketing : no , kids need to know how to use a remote , i would think . industrial designer : most of them will intuitively pick it up though . marketing : they got ta change between disney channel , cartoon network . project manager : okay , so we 're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range marketing : yeah , i think we need it all . project manager : um what about technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? marketing : um i would say we should say dumber than the average person . project manager : okay . user interface : we should go for the lowest denominator . marketing : yeah . project manager : right , okay . so so they need no technical experience to operate user interface : high school educated . industrial designer : how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gon na be able to make it no . project manager : okay . and we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . so we said it needs to send messages to the tv , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . so if you have something just say it and we 'll add it to my meeting minutes . user interface : well it 's channel , on-off button , volume , mute . project manager : mm-hmm , volume . marketing : and channel . yeah . those are the most important ones . project manager : right . and we wan na keep um i 'll make a note here that we wan na keep the number of buttons down . correct , because people only use ten percent . marketing : yeah . project manager : 'kay . hey , what else ? industrial designer : do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? user interface : project manager : i think so . what do you marketing : sure , yeah . project manager : a finding kind of device or marketing : i need we we need a like homing device . project manager : yeah , ho homing device . industrial designer : like if this is gon na get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? user interface : oh right yeah okay . project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : tracking . project manager : okay . marketing : because people really are looking for a remote that 's more high-tech . project manager : right . industrial designer : what if we gave it a charger ? and on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it 's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . user interface : but you got a base . marketing : do you think people 'll really go for that though ? industrial designer : it 's useful for the remote phone . marketing : because yeah . project manager : would that add to our costs at all , i wonder ? marketing : i would think so , because you 'd have to develop a base . project manager : right . user interface : well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . industrial designer : yeah . rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . i i think we can make a decision about that later . uh we 'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . so that would include battery source power source rather . is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? and we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . marketing : right . user interface : well , then we could if we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . marketing : well , th there 's the people who desire speech recognition , there 's the different demog demographics have different desires , i do n't know if you guys ge project manager : you could um we could hook it up . marketing : it would n't copy onto the the thing 'cause it 's black , but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . so basically older people do n't really care . it 's really the people twenty five to thirty five . i feel those are the people that really watch a lot of tv though . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : they 're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and industrial designer : project manager : and if and if we introduced it when they 're this age , they 're going to probably always buy a remote that has user interface : well marketing : just sitcoms and stuff . right . user interface : well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , marketing : so user interface : 'cause then you 've already got remote in your hand , why you just gon na speak to the remote , project manager : right . user interface : whereas if you just speak in general and you do n't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . project manager : yeah . and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . if we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . marketing : right . project manager : a certain phrase then it could beep . i dunno . just throwing it out there . marketing : yeah . project manager : well marketing : user interface : still fifteen minutes . project manager : okay , anything else we wan na discuss ? user interface : um . well , do we wan na include the numbers like zero through nine ? can we conceive of leaving them out ? marketing : wait , on the remote itself ? user interface : yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . project manager : how how , marketing : well , we definitely need those . project manager : yeah , how would you leave those out ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : well , i do n't know , i mean , if you can like well project manager : unless you could say the channel . user interface : i do n't know , if there 's just a way of leaving them out ? industrial designer : i think people would find that too foreign . project manager : yeah , that 's true . marketing : yeah . project manager : and also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . marketing : you definitely need project manager : i used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . so i could n't whenever i got cable , i had to get a new tv . industrial designer : it 's when we get satellite . project manager : mm . get your own remote , or digital cable . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : 'kay . um . i guess , we 're gon na discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . um . industrial designer : yeah , 'cause i do n't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so project manager : 'kay . and do n't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . user interface : the colour being yellow ? marketing : wait . project manager : i 'm guessing . and the r_r_ . user interface : and how do we marketing : i feel like a ye i feel like a yellow one would be too garish . industrial designer : r_ the double r_ . project manager : we could just have the logo in yellow , user interface : ca n't make it entirely project manager : or maybe a yellow light for the keys . industrial designer : or is the l marketing : or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights . industrial designer : yeah , yellow could be and it could does n't have to be huge . user interface : well if you have like a marketing : yeah . user interface : hang on . if you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the r_r_ . project manager : right . so we 've simplified , we do n't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , user interface : right , yeah . project manager : or no menu buttons . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we 've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers yeah . user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : um can we go back to i 'm gon na look really quickly back at those user interface : two examples . project manager : examples and see if there is anything . user interface : yeah . project manager : which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ? user interface : oh , it 's a yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? project manager : the tv . i think that that 's fine just for the tv . i mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? user interface : well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it 's like the buttons that you do n't use as much , but occasionally you will use . and so it 's like marketing : yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . it 's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like i know f k living in los angeles it 's tons of spanish network television if it has english sub-titles it 's definitely helpful . project manager : could n't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the tv that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , user interface : i do n't well , i do n't know . project manager : you know ? user interface : right . marketing : so we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . project manager : for the menus . user interface : well , that could be no you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : that 's true . user interface : channel is just up and down . marketing : yeah , okay . okay , yeah . user interface : and then add a project manager : something that looks mayb you know . marketing : such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . project manager : y right , right right right . user interface : yeah . project manager : that one ? user interface : so we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , project manager : right . user interface : including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now project manager : in the middle perhaps . user interface : included in the menu . marketing : ooh , i just got an idea for a design . project manager : good . anybody have anything else they 'd like to bring up in this meeting ? industrial designer : i had something , but i forgot ."
