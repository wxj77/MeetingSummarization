    "answer": "industrial designer : okay , what does the interface look like ? um well push button , that 's that 's the one we 're all familiar with . um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something . um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it 's it the technology is there . and we can also incorporate an lcd display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we 've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . if we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . all the other fancy interface designs go out the window , i 'm afraid . um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . if you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that 's what you need if you want the lcd display . and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . now i do n't know what that is , but i think they think it 's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , i have to say , but maybe you think that 's old technology . and well i i think we 've got two options . we can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , i think it , um wo n't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um that may or may not be a good thing . marketing : user interface : industrial designer : sorry . um but it could have an lcd screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company 's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . so , thank you . marketing : that sounds good . any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . industrial designer : yeah , marketing : um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty ? industrial designer : i 'm afraid i do n't have that information available . um manufacturing did n't actually give attach any prices to any of this , i 'm afraid . marketing : hmm . because , you know what , i 'm being quite serious when i say that that um the things i mentioned are hot . but i think the important thing might be to choose one . industrial designer : yeah mm-hmm . marketing : you know , if if what you 're telling me is is um some of these things are n't just f are n't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , blackberry . user interface : bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , marketing : that 's uh user interface : so what i had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . industrial designer : banana ? marketing : alright , well let 's see then . user interface : but um i i do n't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the real reaction company . marketing : yeah . user interface : it 's just what i 'd understood we 'd be doing . that 's before i heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise . marketing : yeah . but yeah , industrial designer : we we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , marketing : i 'm trying to streamline mine a little bit . industrial designer : which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately i see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we ca n't do anything fancier . user interface : shall we wait 'til i 've 'til i 've showed you what well , my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . mm . thank you , kate . project manager : thank you , kate . user interface : you did seem to include just in more detail what i 've got though . so so mine 's a bit pointless . right . industrial designer : user interface : f_n_ and f_ eight , did you say ? project manager : yes . there we go . industrial designer : user interface : i do n't have it on mine though . marketing : oh i think um florence resolved it by industrial designer : i if you do f_ uh f_n_ f_ eight again , it 's it 'll project manager : do it again . marketing : f_ eight again . project manager : keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one , industrial designer : i think it yeah , you you will do an project manager : and then you get it with both . user interface : should i do it again ? project manager : yeah . marketing : maybe . industrial designer : project manager : this time it should come up both . user interface : right then . i do n't actually have a huge amount of different information then what kate says , project manager : okay . user interface : just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including m_p_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . project manager : mm-hmm . mm . user interface : uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . uh i 've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel , which well , i could n't find a the picture of the ipod w only linked to a web browser , so i could n't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . it has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse . so i was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . like i guess an existing sky or cable one does . like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what 's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it 'll show you what 's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up marketing : user interface : and you can see what 's on the other channels while you 're watching the same channel on the screen . uh but i 'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . so project manager : user interface : what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , i mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , i was thinking , yellow and black , just because that 's the company 's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . and when you 've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , it does n't obscure much of the actual picture you 're watching . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . industrial designer : yeah , i 'd i 'd certainly support that idea . and the the having the the the screen on the television screen i think is a good idea , 'cause um otherwise we 're we 're putting up the price not only for putting building the lcd in , but for the electronics as well . user interface : and it 's a little bit pointless as well i think . industrial designer : there is that . user interface : like when when when you 've got when you 've got the screen there , it does n't have to be anything fancy , marketing : it 's a duplication . user interface : just a little menu showing yeah , a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wan na change the settings or the you know , your information about programme that 's on at the moment . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i do n't think that 's to taxing to uh s engineer . um . but as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . and i quite like it , 'cause it 's just smooth and hand-held and it 's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out , so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . up , down , left , right . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? user interface : i i was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a i ca n't quite d uh describe it . you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . yeah , see where the mouse is , industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . and enter in the middle , industrial designer : right . user interface : so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . i 'm getting a bit uh specific here . really we 'd have to use something to show you , industrial designer : yeah . i think i think that 's a g nice clean design , user interface : but industrial designer : it 's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology . marketing : to uh m make it . user interface : if i do n't think i can get it up on the screen . ah here we go . right . marketing : oh nice . user interface : well , marketing : um hmm . user interface : the ipod spinning wheel is uh really complicated . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : it does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . what else have we got ? marketing : mm . wow . user interface : them , they 're terrible . but they all have this this feature of this uh it 's not quite a scroll wheel , but it 's a kind of selection in this circle , project manager : it 's a selection wheel . user interface : which i think is a really good idea . industrial designer : but we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper . user interface : yeah , like up , down , left and right . which is good . and then and then yeah , so i mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it 's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . project manager : okay . user interface : so all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . project manager : okay . user interface : and that 's it . industrial designer : in fact user interface : look at look at this one . industrial designer : oh that 's really nice . user interface : almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . project manager : marketing : do you think with um project manager : user interface : might take up your whole living room . project manager : um the next part they want is the user interface concept . industrial designer : i should i should r project manager : i 'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to finish with . marketing : then i 'll just say i support either from a marketing point of view i support either decision that the designers make on that . project manager : okay , and it says interface . what type and what supplements ? user interface : just copy the one on the left . no um a scroll well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . industrial designer : which i think technically is just push button and uh i 'd certainly support that that user interface : yeah , industrial designer : that brings the cost down quite a lot user interface : i 'd like push buttons with industrial designer : and it 's something that we 're an ex the company 's an expert on ."
