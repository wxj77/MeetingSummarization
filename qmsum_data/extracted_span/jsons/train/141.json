    "query": "<s> what did marketing think of the proposal of eliminating teletext technology from their product ?",
    "answer": "marketing : well uh what comes up for me is that if we 're gon na if we 're gon na be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we 're not we 're gon na be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . project manager : mm . mm . yep . marketing : so that 's , from a marketing perspective i i see i see a lack . and so we have to go , i think , in the other direction . what are we gon na have that makes this thing better than project manager : well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is the opportunity that 's presented , i guess . marketing : right . yeah . no , i i agree with you . project manager : okay . marketing : so what i 'm talking about is i see that one side we 're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gon na be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it does n't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . project manager : okay . marketing : so that 's that 's that was my reactions . project manager : yeah . but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . marketing : yeah yeah . project manager : so we 're quite fixed . so we 're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that 's uh that 's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . industrial designer : yeah bu but we we 're designing only the remote , project manager : yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : we not design the tv . so uh we 're gon na be removing the teletext out of any tv that we people use our remote with . marketing : yeah . 'kay . that 's right . industrial designer : so it 's kind of a stupid decision . marketing : i think we take with you . project manager : but there 's also the potential for mark there 's a market here for our lost teletext . user interface : right . project manager : for example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible . twenty-five euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here i guess . marketing : that 's what i 'm that 's what i 'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gon na be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gon na be hap unhappy 'cause it took they ca n't ac access their teletext . okay . 'cause we 're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . project manager : k yeah . marketing : so so it 's it 's not that i 'm criticizing the product at all . it 's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? what are we bringing in to take the place of this , project manager : mm 'kay . marketing : and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up . industrial designer : marketing : if we lose one we need to bring two or three . i have maybe a silly question . i in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there 's gon na be the it 's gon na be out-moded teletext . i i do n't understand how those two things are connected . how does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? i do n't understand that . project manager : well maybe what we 're getting into here is the the idea of uh internet through the tv for example . so that might play on what we can do . industrial designer : yeah the they 're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that user interface : scheduling . um to find out what what you 're watching even if there 's commercials you know . industrial designer : and now yeah marketing : okay . industrial designer : and now you can c look it over internet . but i still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . user interface : i think i ha i agree . marketing : yeah 'cause , yeah , i just i do n't see the cross-over between computers and television . i mean i do see the cross-over in some sense , industrial designer : yeah , but it 's not happen yet . yeah . marketing : but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , okay . user interface : well for me project manager : well you have digital tv still already . user interface : yeah . marketing : so so if we make the cross-over and we 're gon na view television on computers then we 're then we 're losing the the necessity of the remote . s user interface : unless you have a project manager : well there there is a for example on digital tv systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , user interface : yeah . project manager : and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : a a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can yeah , and there 's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live tv and things like that . they 're just features from the internet uh from computers are are coming into the tv sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext ."
