and here 's the agenda for this meeting . uh i 'm just gon na open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . you guys are gon na give us a presentation of our wonder product that i can see some demonstrations of over there . looks cool . and then we 're gon na evaluate it . marketing : bra user interface : project manager : then we 're gon na talk about finance , and i 've got a lovely excel spreadsheet that i knocked up in the last five minutes for this . and uh industrial designer : hmm you knocked it up ? project manager : yep . and we 're gon na evaluate the product and close . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : got forty minutes to do this in . we should be fine . let 's try and keep this one on schedule . user interface : alright . project manager : so industrial designer : project manager : your thing is in where is it ? is it in user interface : three , three . industrial designer : thi third third third . the end product thingy . yeah . project manager : who wants it ? user interface : pedro can have it . industrial designer : user interface : i like industrial designer : . user interface : i 'll help talk . industrial designer : um yeah so what we ended up with . production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight euros , user interface : industrial designer : someone forgot the units there user interface : unit price . industrial designer : yeah , uh unit price unit production price cost thing . um we implemented the basic functions , which is just tv functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . project manager : zapping your favourite channels , eh ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : scrolling through your favourites list . project manager : oh okay okay . industrial designer : zapping you know zapping . project manager : ah 'kay okay , that 's favourites . industrial designer : maybe it 's just a portuguese thing . and um yeah that was the result . project manager : ah 'kay . i like the the the the logo on there as well . industrial designer : user interface : it 's very prominent . project manager : it is very prominent . so this is the user interface : so here i 'll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here . project manager : okay . user interface : uh you 've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . this is the power button . uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ? this is the teletext . industrial designer : start s the the start uh to to to user interface : the programme button , industrial designer : programme yeah . project manager : ah , okay i see . user interface : yeah the programme button . so this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wan na use . so um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . project manager : it 's pretty cool . user interface : so you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gon na be rubber , so it 's pretty hard to actually damage it um project manager : is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? user interface : yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it industrial designer : not helping . project manager : user interface : yeah . project manager : oh well i guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . user interface : yeah and it depends on if it 's sliding , but i think it 's pretty ergonomic . you can feel it . project manager : mm . feels good . industrial designer : project manager : i take it that this is gon na be slightly lighter in the final design as well . user interface : yeah of course . well this is clay . industrial designer : project manager : yeah it 's kinda cool . you have to reach a little bit do n't you . user interface : yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but i think we might scale down the final model a bit . project manager : ah yeah that would n't make sense . user interface : these this is a bit larger than it would be , but project manager : it 's cool . i 'm impressed . industrial designer : do n't have no one to handle that . user interface : project manager : and hold it so marketing : mm that 's project manager : wh what 's the marketing perspective ? marketing : oh that 's oh i like it . i mean you guys gave me more than i was asking for , so i 'm happy because we 've got some really marketable features in this . yeah i think it 's good . good good good job . user interface : mm pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . industrial designer : yeah . so you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where 's my remote . user interface : beep beep beep . marketing : uh pla user interface : industrial designer : the locator function . marketing : i 'm ha project manager : okay . marketing : it 's great . that 's great . it 's a great feature . user interface : um beep beep beep project manager : mm it 's impressing . industrial designer : wicked is n't it ? project manager : so let me get it , user interface : so project manager : if i press this button user interface : beep beep beep project manager : i see . that 's pretty cool . hang on . user interface : beep beep beep be shut up . industrial designer : marketing : so you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he 'll be across town user interface : beep beep beep project manager : i plan to do that as well . user interface : okay . um no no no tha that 's alri project manager : so the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ? user interface : exactly that 's exactly what those are for . project manager : ah okay okay . user interface : and um there 's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is um you could industrial designer : project manager : user interface : beep beep beep industrial designer : user interface : we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger project manager : yeah it 's the right shape is n't it ? user interface : it it 's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we could n't figure out what button is important enough to put there . and we we do n't wan na accidentally be hitting the power button like that so project manager : but maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides . user interface : right . so maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , project manager : okay . user interface : but marketing : uh , i can see that . project manager : but it 's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , has n't it ? user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : yep i like . good job . project manager : so is that the the final colour scheme as well or ? marketing : no no . user interface : oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time . project manager : okay . user interface : so we 'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . project manager : the hmm . user interface : careful . project manager : it came off . the scroll wheels , a problem with them not being sort of user interface : industrial designer : project manager : i do n't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . marketing : well i mean of course , i mean user interface : industrial designer : marketing : my my s my suggestion is we 're gon na go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . you know some blend of silvers and blacks . user interface : beep beep beep . project manager : okay enough of that . industrial designer : project manager : well i it 's cool guys . 'kay so are we done with the this presentation ? user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : now now . user interface : marketing : so you 're not gon na find my uh my folder up there i got ta do mine up at the board . project manager : have you ? okay . marketing : yeah yeah . so project manager : can i not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? marketing : no it 's not in there because i had the computer problem and i i i cou i could n't create it . project manager : oh i see i see . marketing : i could n't create it in the powerpoint , project manager : marketing : and i think i 've got this really strange cable . so what i had , basically going from the powerpoint format , is that uh yeah yeah i like this a lot . is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? project manager : industrial designer : nah . user interface : marketing : so what we had is we had the method . that 's not how you spell method , is it ? user interface : no way . project manager : marketing : no a_ . . so this does n't go so fast this way . and when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product huh . and uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . we 've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the i i do n't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the corp corporate help me . the the corporation stands behind the product , okay . so the features i think we got the scroll , we 've got the uh the locator , we 've got the durability , we 've got the dependability , industrial designer : it fell off . marketing : we 've got you know the features that make this a unique product . um user interface : beep beep beep . marketing : the characteristics i talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . uh and the corporation , we 're talking about we 're we 're a new we 're a new company . we 're wanting to make a name for ourself . we 're wanting you to uh find our product so we 're gon na give you a good product at a fair price . one thing i would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? that was something i would be interested in . um so yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , i believe , to make it marketable i believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty euros . we 're gon na be competitive , and we 're gon na we 're gon na have a market niche . um w project manager : do you would you a argue that that we 're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? marketing : that that would be uh that would be i think a decision best made by corporate um i i m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , i th i think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . project manager : mm-hmm . mm 'kay . marketing : but i 'm sh i 'm sure open to to market this in either direction . but you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost i think it uh there 's nobody else that 's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . the only limitations i see to this is that we 're focused on television only . uh that 's the only that 's the only drawback i see to this . but with all of these other features i think people c one thing i 'm i 'm hoping for is people are not gon na even notice . there 's gon na be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing does n't work for my d_v_d_ and my but i like these other things , so they keep it , they do n't take it back . project manager : and we 're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , are n't we ? th there 's no fundamentally different technology to do that . marketing : well one of one of the thoughts that i had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? you know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . you know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after industrial designer : w we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm , but you follow what i 'm s i 'm s industrial designer : we we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . but uh marketing : yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we 're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that 's that was just an idea i had . uh to me the only additions project manager : yeah , the plus there 's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less b because at the moment it 's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it 's very simple , and it just works . marketing : yeah . project manager : mm there 's a risk of that . marketing : yep . but anyway that 's uh project manager : okay so we can talk about finance now . so i have a little spreadsheet for us where i i was wondering , you when you talked about the fifteen point eight euros , i was wondering how you came up with that figure ? user interface : well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units . marketing : project manager : okay so i have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . now industrial designer : very co very colf colourful . project manager : i 've made a f few assumptions here in that i 'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four euros , user interface : uh-huh . project manager : equivalent to solar cells , which i think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . user interface : uh-huh . project manager : uh and i 'm assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : beep beep beep . project manager : can be made for it sounded different that time uh can be made for a similar price to uh an l_c_ display , user interface : oh , sorry . industrial designer : project manager : uh an uh uh do you think that 's fair coming from a m the manufacturing ? user interface : yeah um i do think we that we we uh do n't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , project manager : . okay . user interface : so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . project manager : yep . okay . so we 're down to sixteen point four , yeah . user interface : and we and we have a single-curved uh project manager : is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? user interface : uh i think that project manager : we 're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur marketing : we 've got a we 've got a curve and a droop . i do n't know whether that . user interface : it 's single-curved , project manager : you think ? okay user interface : yeah . project manager : i 'm convinced . but we save one euro that way , yeah ? so we come bring it down to fifteen point four . user interface : see it 's a little bit more than f single-curved . so yeah it 's fifteen point eight , that 's where we came up with it . project manager : well hang on . marketing : project manager : do do n't speak so it 's in here , in that user interface : okay . project manager : w do we have any we have special form do n't we ? user interface : yeah we do . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so that 's yeah . user interface : ah . what do you know . project manager : but the the the we have n't talked about any special colour though uh i do n't th user interface : oh it 's a that 's not very special , it 's pretty project manager : if we 're going for greys and silvers then i do n't think we 're o okay so we 're user interface : if th . project manager : push-button , scroll wheel , we 're basically we have uh th industrial designer : we do n't project manager : is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? user interface : that 's a scroll . industrial designer : it 's a scroll . project manager : just a scroll ? it 's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ? user interface : uh no we just use it as a scroll . project manager : okay then we have fifteen point eight euros . user interface : it was a pretty accurate estimate i would say . project manager : it was n't bad . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we 're wicked . awesome . project manager : okay so we 're on to the user interface : s 's kind of s frighteningly accurate . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : we 're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that paul the criterion criteria that paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell how 's it going ? anyone got any thoughts ? user interface : what ? project manager : how how have we done today ? user interface : i think we did pretty well . project manager : i think we did pretty well too . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : that looks pretty spectacular . marketing : no , i think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . project manager : any other chang uh thoughts ? okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? marketing : project manager : is it the . industrial designer : that was mm-hmm user interface : sh i think there was plenty of room . project manager : i industrial designer : yeah . project manager : i think we we ended up being quite creative there . user interface : we got a couple innovative i couple innovative ideas . marketing : well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : we raised the price of it , we 've added two t new technology to it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so you know you know if this thing flies then we 've we 've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . project manager : not every idea necessarily , industrial designer : basically . project manager : it 's still a remote control . user interface : marketing : yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager : uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit i guess , industrial designer : project manager : but the uh marketing : but i like i mean when i say we have we had i believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it . project manager : 'kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? no th th i think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . industrial designer : it was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was project manager : i agree . industrial designer : teamwork . marketing : cohesive yeah . project manager : synergy . user interface : there was a lot of synergy . industrial designer : marketing : yes synergistic yeah . project manager : teamwork , yeah he is uh . marketing : yeah . project manager : what did we think of the meeting room , i guess is an important thing here . mm . user interface : these cables suck . project manager : yeah , this falls off industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and uh the white board worked really well without any pro industrial designer : and that 's user interface : yeah . industrial designer : d you must have very long shirts . that 's way far down lapel mic . project manager : mm-mm , lapel . wha okay , oh , alright . industrial designer : lapel lapel lapel . user interface : lapel . industrial designer : that 's almost a crotch mi cr project manager : that 's it 's down , it 's quite close . marketing : you know you know what they 're gon na have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th project manager : keep it , keep it calm . oh dear . no more pizza for me . industrial designer : oh dear oh dear . marketing : project manager : so yeah the the pen came in alright and it 's a little uncomfortable to use but i guess it works . industrial designer : 'cause this is you were using it o upside down . still that user interface : that 's our boss . project manager : nah , i 'm i 'm not convinced of that at all . marketing : industrial designer : project manager : i 've been wor i 've been wondering about that all day , but see these look like they 're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , industrial designer : use them like that . user interface : pedro 's right . project manager : but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . user interface : pedro 's right . project manager : i do n't care . uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . what new ideas have we found ? industrial designer : user interface : oh wel marketing : new ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or project manager : well let 's do both then . marketing : what are we ta project manager : uh for the product ? user interface : well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . project manager : yeah we came up with quite a bit . industrial designer : bunch of new ideas . project manager : and for the meeting room , has anyone got any more industrial designer : yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . project manager : yeah less sore on the ears . marketing : well i i mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but i 'm sure that there 's there 's some justification for these things that i do n't know about . and of course i did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . user interface : marketing : it 's not been uh it 's not been cooperating so well , but i do n't think that 's the that 's avoidable . industrial designer : coulda been worse . project manager : okay so are the costs within the budget ? industrial designer : mm n no . project manager : nope . oh hang on it really that 's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty euros . no requirements are changed . we 're still under twenty euros to build , so we 're good . industrial designer : project manager : and the costs within the budget ? not the original budget , but they are now . is the project evaluated ? mm i think so yeah , then celebration as it says . industrial designer : hooray . marketing : okay . industrial designer : free coke provided at the cafeteria . project manager : oh i do n't know how that got there . user interface : all right . project manager : uh anyway . user interface : industrial designer : who wrote that one ?
