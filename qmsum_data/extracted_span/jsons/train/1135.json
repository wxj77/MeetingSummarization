    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about the component design of the remote control ?",
    "answer": "project manager : uh welcome back after lunch , i hope uh you had a good lunch together . for uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . okay and the agenda will be the opening and uh that 's uh the product manager or secretary that 's me and uh the presentations from the christine and uh agnes and from mister ed . and finally in this meeting we have to decide marketing : project manager : and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design so we have forty minutes , i think it 's uh little bit uh low , but i i hope we can finish it up so i 'll handle to the the functional team , to the christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept . industrial designer : okay . so uh , if you could open the powerpoint presentation . marketing : industrial designer : i 'm number two . project manager : you 're number two . 'kay industrial designer : components design , there we go . marketing : industrial designer : so uh can we put it in slide show mode ? yeah . project manager : the next one . industrial designer : right here , is that little that one , yes please . marketing : industrial designer : thank you . project manager : industrial designer : i 'll take the mouse . so uh project manager : industrial designer : we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . in instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , project manager : industrial designer : you have to have microphone well no you do n't actually i have n't have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way marketing : industrial designer : it has to it has to hear the speaker user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it 's gets lost . um so the other w thing that we so . our method for going about this is we 've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what 's worked , what has n't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials marketing : industrial designer : and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing did n't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research . marketing : industrial designer : so um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . marketing : industrial designer : course , you know , i wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh does n't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore , user interface : industrial designer : so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that 's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor user interface : industrial designer : and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it 's uh goes with the board . uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it 's brittle it gets brittle after a while , user interface : industrial designer : so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium 's also been eliminated uh , user interface : industrial designer : the m people in manufacturing said that you could n't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how apple did it with th powerbook i 'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they 've eliminated all of our options except wood . user interface : at least it 's environmentally friendly . industrial designer : so , this is our finding . marketing : industrial designer : and a as she said , it 's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we 're we 're currently uh proposing , marketing : industrial designer : uh we 'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . marketing : industrial designer : so then there 's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , user interface : project manager : industrial designer : uh these simple chips , but that 's only works for the bu you do n't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . and um then there was the regular which i regret that i 've forgotten exactly why i 'm eliminating that one . uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , marketing : industrial designer : which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . marketing : industrial designer : and uh manufacturing has told us that they 've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um i i 'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , user interface : industrial designer : you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . i think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then i uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . so this is the findings of our research marketing : industrial designer : and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . do you have any problems with that ? project manager : can you go back uh one slide ? industrial designer : i 'm not sure , how do i oh , i know , let 's see . user interface : thank you . yeah . industrial designer : let 's go back up here . project manager : yes , uh question , uh , what 's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? what 's the meaning of that ? industrial designer : i think it 's um um a multiple uh chip design um and it 's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . user interface : project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : industrial designer : uh i could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . project manager : yeah , is it means it 's on the yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh industrial designer : i do n't know , but i 'll find out more at our next meeting . project manager : okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good . marketing : industrial designer : sounds good . user interface : why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? industrial designer : because um it gets brittle , cracks user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um we want we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . so . good ex good expression . user interface : whic which marketing : good expression . well after us . user interface : industrial designer : i do n't know , speak for yourself , i 'm planning to be around for a while . user interface : although i think marketing : user interface : i think with wood though you 'd run into the same types of problems , would n't you , i mean it chips , it if you drop it , industrial designer : marketing : user interface : uh it 's i 'm not su industrial designer : project manager : so so you 're not convinced about the the wood , yes . user interface : industrial designer : you 're what ? marketing : actually , i 'm ready to sell it . user interface : i think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , marketing : i 'm ready to sell it . industrial designer : you think ? and you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . user interface : but you ca n't just use marketing : no y no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , user interface : yeah , exactly , yeah . marketing : but there are some very pretty woods out there . industrial designer : well i 'm glad you user interface : marketing : that 's actually very innovative idea . industrial designer : okay , good . user interface : industrial designer : sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . marketing : industrial designer : marketing : well , it 's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : the stain . marketing : i mean it 's each person is gon na have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that 's not on the market . user interface : project manager : yeah , so it it 's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ? marketing : user interface : um , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own project manager : yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first marketing : in turns of wow . industrial designer : user interface : industrial designer : she works in the cubicle next to me so she 's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this . user interface : y yeah . marketing : industrial designer : luckily ed was not . user interface : marketing : wood ? user interface : i think we can get the quality materials then it should n't influence the design principles too much , which you 'll see with my presentation . marketing : user interface : one thing we 'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh industrial designer : mm-hmm . yeah , you would n't wan na have to have splinters in your hand while you 're using your user interface : yeah , for example . so , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , marketing : industrial designer : it 's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . user interface : but marketing : user interface : marketing : they do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , industrial designer : yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . marketing : so , and chew 'em up . and chew 'em up . project manager : okay then , uh , let 's move to agnes . so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . so , but uh le let 's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh ed was talking . and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so user interface : mm-hmm . i think it depends , i mean i think it 's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it 's gon na be because theoretically with the tv you already have a big display right in front of you . project manager : yeah . user interface : so , if we 're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for , industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : 'cause if it 's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that 's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , project manager : user interface : but that 's just sort of speculation , i mean . industrial designer : what do you think ed ? do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ? marketing : no . no industrial designer : do you wan na take an action item to go find out ? marketing : no p spec it 's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . industrial designer : okay . sorry about that . marketing : um , no that 's no problem . i 'm here for the pushing it after it 's made . i will market it . industrial designer : marketing : once we get a price on it then we can market it . industrial designer : so the the advanced chip on print is what um what we 've we 've deci we 've determined marketing : industrial designer : and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um i think we 've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . project manager : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : a customisable and marketing : nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . user interface : what about the buttons , would would the buttons be wood too , or industrial designer : uh i do n't think so , no , project manager : i do n't think so . industrial designer : i think they could be rubber like they are now , project manager : yes . yes ."
