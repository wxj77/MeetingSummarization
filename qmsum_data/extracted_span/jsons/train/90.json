'kay . look at my sad sad giraffe . marketing : no , that 's good . project manager : no , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , but whatever . i do n't know even much about giraffes , but i just love the way they look . they 're just such odd creatures , you know . i i like that they 're so unique and individual , i guess . i do n't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . only seen a couple in zoos . marketing : you do n't really have to , i mean , if you like 'em project manager : yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . okay . alright . guess we 're getting straight back into business here . um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five euro , and our profit aim is fifty million euro . we 're going to make this an international product marketed in the states , in europe , in asia . and um our production cost to make that profit is gon na be a max of twelve fifty euro per remote . okay . so we 're gon na talk for a little while . um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . so . yeah . you wan na start us off ? anybody have anything to offer ? user interface : industrial designer : well , we wan na make a multifunctional remote , right ? project manager : right . industrial designer : one remote for everything . user interface : and everything being wait , we have what , sound system , tv , d_v_d_ , v_h_s_ , uh tivo ? marketing : right . industrial designer : um . i think they 'll be phasing v_h_s_ out shortly . marketing : yeah , tivo . project manager : tivo . user interface : but it 's still there , so industrial designer : okay . user interface : if po if we 're gon na do it marketing : it needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal . project manager : they 're never universal . that 's right . esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , d_v_d_ player , say , usually it does n't work if it 's not one of the user interface : or if it 's not like a sony , if it 's like a i do n't know . project manager : yeah . yeah . something from sam 's club . industrial designer : so we 'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals . project manager : yeah . marketing : and what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways . project manager : yeah . 'kay , and um another thing that i think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . if it 's just flat and kind of boring th those do n't nobody wants to buy those any more . they want the ergonomic ones . marketing : they want like the flashy lights . project manager : yeah . marketing : oh like this came from las vegas . project manager : ones that ones that look high-tech , too . user interface : but at the same time are simple . project manager : right . marketing : mm yeah . project manager : so that people like my mother can use it . industrial designer : what about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ? project manager : yeah . user interface : project manager : 'kay . anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that user interface : just bad ones . project manager : yeah . that 's true . industrial designer : what kinda battery would we want to use ? because battery changing is usually user interface : d double a_ . marketing : double a_ . industrial designer : okay . project manager : do some of them use triple a_s though ? marketing : yeah some use triple a_s . project manager : okay . user interface : some but marketing : so double or triple ? user interface : yeah , i guess then it 's if we need to do triple a_ we can , but most people usually have double a_s around . project manager : okay . yeah . but that has to do with the size of it too . well , w as long as we know that issue is industrial designer : yeah . user interface : right . project manager : here we can marketing : yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we 'd probably wan na go with a triple a_ . project manager : triple a . but industrial designer : can you with a small lithium battery ? project manager : it 's okay , we do n't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . user interface : project manager : hey . anything else ? alright . moving along . oh , we 're closing the meeting . next meeting is gon na start in thirty minutes . here 's what we 're going to do . um the i_d_ , which is who ? okay , you 're going to think about the working design . what do you think that means ? marketing : project manager : okay . and u_i_d_ , the technical fun functions design , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . okay . and the marketing person , that 's courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification . i guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . right ? i would think so . okay . marketing : right ."
