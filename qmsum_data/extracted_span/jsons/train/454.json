    "answer": "mark reckless am : cabinet secretary , how would you assess the impact of pdg on attendance and hopefully subsequent engagement with education from children who have free school meals ? kirsty williams am : i think what 's important to note is that , as estyn have themselves said , over the period of the last inspection report , we have seen improvements in attendance , but i do think we need to , again , look at how pdg can support this particular agenda . and as always in the welsh education system , there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this . ysgol y preseli in pembrokeshire is a very good example of how they 've deployed their money . forgive me ; i ca n't off the top of my head remember the name of the primary school i visited , again in north wales , where the school has proactively used this money , and they actually send teaching assistants out of school in the morning before the start of the school day , and they actually have a walking bus . they call at homes for children , and they walk the children to the breakfast club . so , they 're proactively going out into the community and making sure that those children are in the classrooms , because the teacher said , 'we recognised we had a problem with attendance . we tried a variety of means of improving that , but in the end we have taken this quite bold step\u2014we actually send the staff out and they create that walking bus , and they walk the children into school ' . they say that they know that , for some of those children , because of the difficult circumstances they and their families are living in , they probably would n't be in school if it was n't for that proactive approach . so , we 're looking again at what more we can do to support this particular agenda in terms of improving attendance , because although , again , there are examples of good practice , there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils . and , of course , we can have the best curriculum in the world with really high-quality teaching , but unless the children are in the classes then we 're not going to make the difference for them . whilst that differential exists , then it 's going to be hard to close the attainment gap for those children . mark reckless am : i was actually quite shocked just reading in advance of this meeting that the proportion attending 95 per cent or more , who have pretty full attendance , was only 35 per cent for free-school-meal children at level 4 , compared to 60 per cent for non-free-school-meal pupils . it still is an extraordinary difference . my colleague here showed me , i think , last week , a graph showing the link between attendance and attainment , in particular . when people were absent , a lot of the\u2014 . as i 'm sure you 're aware , there 's a huge connection . what more can pdg do to deal with it ? in the example you give i can see how a school with an awful lot of free-school-meal children could do that , but a lot of the free-school-meal children are actually in schools that do n't have that high a proportion of free school meals , where it would be much more challenging to bring in that type of initiative ."
