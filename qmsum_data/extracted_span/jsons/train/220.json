    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about extra designs or gadgets to make the remote control special ?",
    "answer": "project manager : yeah . yeah , okay . but that 's that 's do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? how we can what the extra touch can be . do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or industrial designer : maybe th m project manager : well , it was something about how we lose them . maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . marketing : i think that 's n that 's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever . user interface : to find him . that 's maybe yeah . project manager : yeah . i do n't know . i do n't know . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : nah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . it w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i has something nice . marketing : yeah , yeah , that 's good one , yep . project manager : or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , user interface : yeah . project manager : or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener . maybe it contains some feature that you do n't normally link to a remote control . i think it 's very impor because we 're gon na make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . user interface : yeah . project manager : it 's gon na cost twenty five euros . marketing : ye i think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination . project manager : yeah , but the well , it 's already been done . user interface : yeah , but that 's yeah . project manager : nah . yeah , that 's true . but and i think it 's gon na be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . it has to be used something special , user interface : yeah . project manager : and you really it has to , you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . we 're really gon na use them . not some thing you you throw away next week , you know . marketing : no , that 's true . project manager : so maybe uh that 's i i think that 's when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it 's very important to find something like this . so there 's a very important task for you . and maybe we can all think about it . user interface : be original , yeah . project manager : uh , also for you maybe , when t you it 's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know . user interface : mm-hmm . and use friendly , yeah . project manager : so big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : project manager : uh-huh . user interface : must brain-storm . marketing : yeah , a swapable front or whatever . project manager : yeah , or just different colours would be uh i do n't know if people also wan na spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . user interface : well industrial designer : for the remote control . project manager : it could be be yeah , you never know , but user interface : why not ? marketing : yeah . user interface : more money for us . marketing : project manager : but it and i think we have to make it quite big . user interface : yeah . quite big . yeah , you think ? project manager : yeah , marketing : yes , definitely , definitely . project manager : people industrial designer : that 's to be uh a formed for your hand . project manager : so , and and also because uh it is expensive . if you want it to be something , you know , it 's ha does n't have much functions marketing : project manager : want to be you do n't want to get it l make it marketing : yes , it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room . as i uh as i said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o project manager : mm-hmm . and shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . i i think you m might wan na put it uh user interface : a standard or something . project manager : yeah , that it it it it stands up . yeah , you have to put it on its so it 's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . marketing : yeah . a face ? project manager : no no , put stuff inside it . but , it 's like like a statue or something marketing : or uh yeah , yeah . yeah . user interface : industrial designer : more like a joystick then . marketing : yeah , yeah , i see what you mean , yep . user interface : it 's like you have uh four phones . something like that . project manager : yeah yeah , but yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in marketing : if you do that , but i do n't know if that 's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half euros . project manager : that it 's it 's fashionable . user interface : project manager : i i do n't marketing : i in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . project manager : oh , yeah . marketing : that 's probably stupid , but uh as i found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ? industrial designer : but that 's that 's fun for the first time , and then the second marketing : uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control . project manager : yeah , but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it marketing : no uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in . project manager : oh , okay . user interface : on the television . project manager : uh , that 's kind of nice . user interface : oh , like this . marketing : if an a button in in that uh user interface : project manager : and then also you do n't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . industrial designer : or you can user interface : a char chargeable . yeah . marketing : yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . why not . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah , that w yeah , but yeah , the pro no , well i think that it might be t p well , nee but we do n't yeah . user interface : why not . project manager : maybe you , but we do n't know much about production cost , but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on a remote control and it 's a basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , rechargeable units . industrial designer : with recharger . user interface : marketing : it should only cost twelve and a half euros , of course . aye ? project manager : yeah , but we would d ma we 'd do it in taiwan and so , it 's not gon na be that expen user interface : production . marketing : yeah , okay . project manager : uh i i think it 's a great idea . user interface : it should be possible . i think it 's a good idea . marketing : yeah . project manager : s some kind of be i 've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays . user interface : to make a base or something ? marketing : yes . yes , definitely . yeah . industrial designer : yes , but is that handy ? project manager : well , i well it 's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . that 's one . user interface : it 's it 's it 's it 's project manager : and uh you can always find your remote control up user interface : it 's not the purpose to be handy , it 's industrial designer : but but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries . project manager : uh , okay . well , maybe yeah , you could when that 's when it 's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , industrial designer : and then you project manager : but you will you do need uh also an uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . does it makes it kinda industrial designer : yes . or marketing : well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . user interface : mm . yeah , but that 's not it 's ugly , i think . project manager : yeah , yeah . okay . yeah . marketing : i do n't know . project manager : yeah , but then it 's very easy to make it also a rechargeab i do n't think that is gon na cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . marketing : on the other hand , if you do n't do it , we can also make a nice bay . i mean , it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it , project manager : yeah . marketing : but um i think the bay is definitely uh project manager : i think it 's a good idea . and make it , you know , we we um well , we uh it 's it is n't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . we can save on the on the functions . we just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there 's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , marketing : sure , why not . yep . project manager : it 's also nice . and if you put it away , i think it 's uh w we have to we uh that 's uh marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's not a easy market . user interface : yeah . project manager : we have to something special . and for twenty five euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , marketing : yeah . user interface : true . project manager : and we ca n't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions , user interface : yeah . marketing : definitely . project manager : because we are n't gon na put marketing : with eye candy , ear candy , whatever . yeah , definitely . project manager : yeah . and then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing . yeah . i think i think it 's a good idea . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have . project manager : yeah . marketing : definitely , yeah . project manager : oh , if it let 's well , we will see what 's possible concerning the the costs , and if it 's possible we 'll do that . and we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . user interface : yeah . project manager : and the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . if that 's too expensive , we wo n't do that . user interface : yeah , we c project manager : but it would be nice . marketing : it would be nice , yes . project manager : it 's the idea . i know that batteries last long nowadays . and and what people just think about , well , i 'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it 's very annoying when your battery is empty . and you know then when you have n't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo i 've experienced that that marketing : most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes . project manager : yeah , okay . so , easy functions . well , we will we will i think we 'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi user interface : or just give a beep when the battery 's out or uh down . project manager : yeah . but it 's also annoying . marketing : yeah , why not . user interface : project manager : 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you 're not very motivated to do something about it . user interface : yeah . true . project manager : then it beeps all the time and . marketing : no , that 's true . project manager : you do n't want to have ever have those problems , and you wo n't have if if you have the rechargeable . and you do n't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people do n't like it . uh , i i in the in the ma marketing : why not . industrial designer : but you pay for it . project manager : yeah , but it w i mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that 's a great idea , i 'm gon na use it . and when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , i 'll never put him in the recharger , i think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . then when they look get m i i i know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they 're seeking for the remote control , they wan na see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , user interface : yeah . project manager : i think it 's brilliant . marketing : bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . yeah . project manager : yeah , i 've never it 's so simple , but i 've never seen it . user interface : yeah . project manager : m maybe we should really do this . user interface : and you can leave it just there . marketing : no . nearly . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah ."
