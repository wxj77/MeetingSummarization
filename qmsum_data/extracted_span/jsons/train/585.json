    "query": "<s> what was said about the transcriber pool ?",
    "answer": "grad f : um , so that the reason it 's not just a transcript is that there 're false starts , and misreads , and miscues and things like that . and so i have a set of scripts and x waves where you just select the portion , hit r , um , it tells you what the next one should be , and you just look for that . you know , so it it 'll put on the screen , `` the next set is six nine , nine two two `` . and you find that , and , hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format . professor c : so is this grad f : and so the the question is , should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ? well , some of us . i 've been do i 've done , eight meetings , something like that , just by hand . just myself , rather . so it will not take long . um professor c : uh , what what do you think ? postdoc b : my feeling is that we discussed this right before coffee and i think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , um , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them . and also it is contributing to the , uh , c composition of the transcript cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it 'll be a more complete transcript . so i 'm i think it 's fine , that part . grad f : there is there is professor c : so you think it 's fine to have the transcribers do it ? postdoc b : mm - hmm . professor c : yeah , ok . grad f : there 's one other small bit , which is just entering the information which at s which is at the top of this form , onto the computer , to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically . phd d : good . professor c : yeah . grad f : and so it 's just , you know , typing in name , times time , date , and so on . um , which again either they can do , but it is , you know , firing up an editor , or , again , i can do . or someone else can do . postdoc b : and , that , you know , i 'm not , that that one i 'm not so sure if it 's into the the , things that , i , wanted to use the hours for , because the , the time that they 'd be spending doing that they would n't be able to be putting more words on . but that 's really your choice , it 's your phd d : so are these two separate tasks that can happen ? or do they have to happen at the same time before grad f : no they do n't have this you have to enter the data before , you do the second task , but they do n't have to happen at the same time . so it 's it 's just i have a file whi which has this information on it , and then when you start using my scripts , for extracting the times , it adds the times at the bottom of the file . and so , um , i mean , it 's easy to create the files and leave them blank , and so actually we could do it in either order . phd d : oh , ok . grad f : um , it 's it 's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double - check , to make sure you 're entering for the right person . but , either way . professor c : yeah . yeah just by way of uh , uh , a uh , order of magnitude , uh , um , we 've been working with this aurora , uh data set . and , uh , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , uh , is about , uh i think the best score was something like five percent , uh , error , per digit . phd a : per digit . professor c : so , that grad f : per digit . professor c : you 're right . so if you were doing ten digit , uh , recognition , you would really be in trouble . so so the the point there , and this is uh car noise uh , uh things , but but real real situation , phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : well , `` real `` , um , the uh there 's one microphone that 's close , that they have as as this sort of thing , close versus distant . uh but in a car , instead of instead of having a projector noise it 's it 's car noise . uh but it was n't artificially added to get some some artificial signal - to - noise ratio . it was just people driving around in a car . so , that 's that 's an indication , uh that was with , many sites competing , and this was the very best score and so forth , so . more typical numbers like phd d : although the models were n't , that good , right ? i mean , the models are pretty crappy ? professor c : you 're right . i think that we could have done better on the models , but the thing is that we got this this is the kind of typical number , for all of the , uh , uh , things in this task , all of the , um , languages . and so i i think we 'd probably the models would be better in some than in others . um , so , uh . anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard . postdoc b : hmm . it 's gon na be fun to see how we , compare at this . very exciting . s @ @ . professor c : yeah . phd d : how did we do on the ti - digits ? grad f : well the prosodics are so much different s it 's gon na be , strange . i mean the prosodics are not the same as ti - digits , for example ."
