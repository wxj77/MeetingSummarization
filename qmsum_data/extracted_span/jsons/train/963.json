    "query": "<s> what did the meeting discuss about the support offered to the agri-food sector ?",
    "answer": "hon . wayne easter ( malpeque , lib . ) : thank you , mr . chair . at the finance committee , we 've heard a lot of concerns from all sectors of the economy as a result of covid-19 and we 've been presented with quite a number of possible solutions as well , several of which the government has acted upon . my question is on the support offered to the agri-food sector announced on tuesday . it is very welcome support , but i sincerely believe the farm sector will be taking the prime minister up on the suggestion that $ 250 million should be seen as an initial investment . potatoes are the number one commodity in prince edward island . however , as a result of reduced processor contracts for next year , plus cancelled seed contracts , millions of dollars of seed and process potatoes have no home . to make matters worse , farmers have high fixed costs that they now have to spread over fewer acres . how does the minister see tuesday 's announcement addressing potato farmers ' concerns ? second , in 2013 , long-term financial safety nets were gutted by the harper government . will the minister be coming forward with improved business risk management programs as a result ?"
