    "query": "<s> what did kirsty williams think of the additional funding to hefcw when discussing the funding to support wales universities to go through the financial problems ?",
    "answer": "julie morgan am : the additional \u00a36.4 million that went to hefcw in the 2017-18 year , which i think you say is partly because of brexit and partly because of demographic and recruitment challenges , what do you expect to see as a result of that spending ? kirsty williams am : that funding was allocated , as i said , to enable hefcw to deal with any short-term implications arising out of demographic changes , because we 've seen a drop in the number of 18-year-olds , and the initial implications of eu transition . it was allocated as part of hefcw 's overall grant in aid , and therefore the council was given discretion as to how it was to be apportioned to the sector . the money was brought forward a year , because , in conversations with hefcw and the institutions , they felt that that money would be more useful earlier on . so , it was money that was brought forward into the allocation for 2017-18 , as opposed to 2018-19 , because they wanted to have that resource earlier rather than later . with regard to additional resources , you 'll be aware that we have made an additional resource of \u00a35 million available to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees , and \u00a35 million has been made available to hefcw to kick-start the work on postgraduate support until we 're in a position to fully implement diamond at the postgraduate level . julie morgan am : you say that the money is used at the discretion of the universities . so , you do n't have an analysis of how that was spent . kirsty williams am : the financial allocation , as i said , was agreed with the funding council and it was there to help universities with any cash flow issues , but if you 'd like further details i can provide those as much as i 'm able . julie morgan am : i think it would be interesting if we know what the money was spent on and , of course , that money is now not available for the next financial year , so there 's no way of carrying on what they were doing with it , presumably ."
