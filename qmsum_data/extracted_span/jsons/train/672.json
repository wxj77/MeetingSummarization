    "answer": "industrial designer : you 're gon na be a little disappointed with some of the things i have to tell you , but i 'm afraid this is the real world . so um i 've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and i 've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what 's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they 've got , but i 'm not sure that it 's quite what you want um . now this is n't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . i really need a pen or something but uh does my mouse work ? no . um oh yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ? right . this is this is the a a a remote that 's been opened up and that 's the the back of the interface . and this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they 're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . um and we that 's the basic construction that we 've got to got to accommodate . we got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver . so um i wan i wan na go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made , sarah , but um doing my presentation in the order i wrote it . so first of all um i wan na talk about what possibilities we 've got for the energy source . marketing : industrial designer : um we can have your bog standard double double a_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . we can have a hand sorry user interface : a wind-up . marketing : industrial designer : a wind-up , yeah , which i think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , marketing : project manager : industrial designer : but i it maybe is does n't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . marketing : project manager : alright . industrial designer : um one that one that i think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , marketing : project manager : remember , we only have forty minutes industrial designer : where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . you have to it means that if it 's sitting there for a long time it probably wo n't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , it 'll work . user interface : industrial designer : or we we had talked about solar power , but i thing that we agreed that that 's not so good in the dark . project manager : i wan na thank you all for all your presentations . we have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . um and i think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . so let 's mm . right . they want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which the choices that we 've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . um this is where kate 's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be a little bit guided by kate at this point . industrial designer : project manager : the you were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you 'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . um or solar that you 'd have difficulty with it if it 's a dark day , that it 'll die on you , and no way to do it . that 's the day you wan na use the tv . um so what 's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? industrial designer : oh unfortunately i do n't have costing information . project manager : okay . industrial designer : i i in terms of workability , i i think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , project manager : mm 'kay . industrial designer : but i 'm sorry i do n't figures on the difference in cost . project manager : what 's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ? marketing : i 've used kinetic in terms of watches and it 's very very uh handy , you do n't even notice um that it 's there . user interface : it sounds great . i 've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . sounds like it could be g a really good economical marketing : it 's user interface : it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . marketing : mm-hmm . it could tie in with the fanciful design user interface : yeah . marketing : as uh , you know , user interface : 'cause it 's really a quite attractive thought , marketing : throw the banana , you know , just got ta keep it moving . user interface : is n't it ? it 's like yeah , project manager : so the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it 's at all possible . user interface : a good selling point . but it does depend how much i mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . project manager : it costs . mm . industrial designer : and and how much you do have to keep it moving , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : 'cause i 'm conscious that watching tv can be quite a sed sedentary activity . marketing : yeah . mm-hmm . but i could market that as a um as a a i was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . user interface : do your exercises while you 're watching the tv . industrial designer : yeah . true , yeah , m more more environmentally friendly . user interface : yeah , that 's what i was thinking as well . marketing : mm-hmm . you know , project manager : yeah . marketing : kind of the project manager : thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . industrial designer : oh right , okay , project manager : um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . industrial designer : i 'd that that 's something i maybe should have covered . um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and i would certainly recommend it , i think , because i 'm not sure i have an alternative . project manager : okay . user interface : project manager : what about the ca industrial designer : i i it it 's just the way that the the the uh th the way it 's ac it 's actually built project manager : yeah . oh , the way we uh-huh ."
