    "query": "<s> what did the group talk about the admission problems of wales universities and corresponding solutions ?",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 're going to move on , then , to talk about student recruitment . i 'm going to , because we 've got a lot of questions , appeal for brief questions and answers that are as concise as possible , please . hefin . hefin david am : how does the welsh government account for the fact that eu student applications in wales this year\u2014that wales is the only country in the uk to have seen a significant drop ? kirsty williams am : okay , well , i think the first thing to remember is that we will not get a full picture of student recruitment until , first of all , november and then the true picture , because some institutions , as you would know , have two admissions dates\u2014we wo n't get the full picture until the spring . i think it was inevitable , given the change in government policy with regard to student support , which had previously allowed european students to benefit from a tuition fee grant , and given the fact that that option is no longer available to them , that that has had an impact on eu recruitment , and there 's no point trying to hide from that . hefin david am : so , together with leaving the eu , that 's a double-whammy effect that 's hitting wales harder than the rest of the uk . kirsty williams am : it just puts us in the same position as eu students applying to england , but it was inevitable . this was looked at by diamond . it was anticipated that this could be a consequence of the change in policy , and i think we see that reflected in the initial figure , although , as i said , we wo n't get the true picture until the first census in november , and then , ultimately , the final picture in the spring . hefin david am : how concerned are you by that ? kirsty williams am : clearly , we want our universities to be able to attract students from both the eu and from around the world . the fact that the tuition fee grant arrangements may have had an impact on european union students at this stage does not preclude the fact that wales , up until now , has been successful in recruiting international students . so , the change in the fee regime should not be a barrier to the recruitment of international students , because , actually , international students outside of the eu make up a bigger proportion of students not from the uk who come to our institutions . hefin david am : that 's a fair point , but it 's unfortunate timing , though , is n't it ? kirsty williams am : i think , from a public policy point of view and moving towards a sustainable way of funding our he sector , then both my priority and , i would say , the priority of the institutions was to see the implementation of diamond , which is what we have done . hefin david am : okay , that 's fine . what about the fact that we 've got a relatively imbalanced higher education profile compared to other countries of the uk with regard to high , medium and low-tariff universities ? we 've got one high-tariff university , and they 're the ones that tend to show the growth in recruitment of eu students . are you concerned about that balance of profile in the he sector ? kirsty williams am : as i said in answer to your question earlier , there is a difference reflected in the exposure of institutions to eu and international students . i would argue that it 's not necessarily the case that institutions that are not high-tariff are not able to do very well in this sector . if you look , for instance , at swansea university\u2014if you look at the work swansea university has done , that shows you what is possible . hefin david am : what is swansea 's success , then ? what can we learn from swansea ? kirsty williams am : what i think is important\u2014and this is not about any one institution\u2014what i think is really important is that we look to\u2014 . and i ca n't force institutions to do this . it 's a combination , i believe , for all universities , of getting their offer right\u2014so , having a curriculum at their institution that is attractive and offers courses that people want to study . it 's about that curriculum being delivered in an excellent fashion , so high quality ratings for teaching , as well as having an infrastructure that is attractive to students . so , it 's all about getting the offer right and providing what students , both domestically and internationally , want . hefin david am : but the evidence would therefore suggest that that model of success that you 've just outlined is happening in swansea but it is n't happening in other institutions , and they 're seeing a drop . kirsty williams am : well , as i said , i think what we can see from cardiff , swansea and others is that it is possible to do very well in the sector . hefin david am : so , cardiff , swansea and bangor\u2014but the others , not . kirsty williams am : as i said , what we can see is that , if you get the offer right , i think we have something very special that the he sector can market itself on . lynne neagle am : llyr , you 've got a supplementary . llyr gruffydd am : just coming back to the drop in eu students , you mentioned that one of the reasons probably is the change in the funding that 's available to students coming here . so , does that suggest that , under the current regime , wales was punching above its weight in terms of attracting students and we 've lost that advantage ? i know we 're gaining in other ways in introducing the new system , but really we 're not much different to england in terms of fees now , so why would they come to wales as opposed to going anywhere else ? kirsty williams am : i think you 're right ; there was an added incentive , potentially , to come to a welsh institution because of the availability of the tuition fee grant . that advantage is no longer there , which is why we need to work alongside the sector , as we 're doing with the global wales programme , to increase their ability to market he in the round across the world . i think we 've got a strong offer that we can speak to people about . i 'm very proud of what our institutions can deliver for people . it 's a fantastic , warm environment to come and study in , at great institutions . there 's something for everybody , whether you want to be in a city like cardiff or whether you want a coastal experience in a small town like aber . so , we 've got a lot to offer and that 's why it 's really important that , although we have seen a change in the tuition fees , which may have an impact , we are investing with universities , for instance , in the global wales programme . lynne neagle am : in terms of the drop that we 've seen in wales , which is differential amongst institutions , will you be taking any specific action to try and prevent brexit exacerbating that ? kirsty williams am : we are working with hefcw and individual institutions , as i said , to test their preparedness . we ca n't tell them what to do in that sense , but we can , because of our governance arrangements and hefcw 's monitoring arrangements , continue to test with them . i meet regularly with vice-chancellors and separately with the chairs of the institutions and separately again with hefcw representatives , and the sustainability of the sector and recruitment issues is always something that is on the agenda ."
