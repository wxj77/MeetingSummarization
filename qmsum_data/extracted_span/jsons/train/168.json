    "answer": "marketing : so you 're not gon na find my uh my folder up there i got ta do mine up at the board . project manager : have you ? okay . marketing : yeah yeah . so project manager : can i not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? marketing : no it 's not in there because i had the computer problem and i i i cou i could n't create it . project manager : oh i see i see . marketing : i could n't create it in the powerpoint , project manager : marketing : and i think i 've got this really strange cable . so what i had , basically going from the powerpoint format , is that uh yeah yeah i like this a lot . is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? project manager : industrial designer : nah . user interface : marketing : so what we had is we had the method . that 's not how you spell method , is it ? user interface : no way . project manager : marketing : no a_ . . so this does n't go so fast this way . and when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product huh . and uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . we 've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the i i do n't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the corp corporate help me . the the corporation stands behind the product , okay . so the features i think we got the scroll , we 've got the uh the locator , we 've got the durability , we 've got the dependability , industrial designer : it fell off . marketing : we 've got you know the features that make this a unique product . um user interface : beep beep beep . marketing : the characteristics i talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . uh and the corporation , we 're talking about we 're we 're a new we 're a new company . we 're wanting to make a name for ourself . we 're wanting you to uh find our product so we 're gon na give you a good product at a fair price . one thing i would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? that was something i would be interested in . um so yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , i believe , to make it marketable i believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty euros . we 're gon na be competitive , and we 're gon na we 're gon na have a market niche . um w project manager : do you would you a argue that that we 're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? marketing : that that would be uh that would be i think a decision best made by corporate um i i m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , i th i think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . project manager : mm-hmm . mm 'kay . marketing : but i 'm sh i 'm sure open to to market this in either direction . but you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost i think it uh there 's nobody else that 's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . the only limitations i see to this is that we 're focused on television only . uh that 's the only that 's the only drawback i see to this . but with all of these other features i think people c one thing i 'm i 'm hoping for is people are not gon na even notice . there 's gon na be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing does n't work for my d_v_d_ and my but i like these other things , so they keep it , they do n't take it back . project manager : and we 're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , are n't we ? th there 's no fundamentally different technology to do that . marketing : well one of one of the thoughts that i had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? you know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . you know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after industrial designer : w we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm , but you follow what i 'm s i 'm s industrial designer : we we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . but uh marketing : yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we 're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that 's that was just an idea i had . uh to me the only additions project manager : yeah , the plus there 's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less b because at the moment it 's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it 's very simple , and it just works . marketing : yeah . project manager : mm there 's a risk of that ."
