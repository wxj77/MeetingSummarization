    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about marketing 's presentation on three important marketing points that the team should pay attention to ?",
    "answer": "marketing : right . well , i 'm just basically letting you know what 's happening in the markets project manager : mm yeah . marketing : and what the fashions are for next year . um . so yes , so from looking at this year 's trends and fashions project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and also recent investigation that we 've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to project manager : marketing : which we 've already probably discussed . um the most important aspect is look and feel . so the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . so it has to be project manager : yeah , why should people buy this when they 're already got a remote that came with the tv ? marketing : exactly . user interface : yeah . marketing : um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . so project manager : what 's that mean ? marketing : technologically it should be like um work , basically , i guess . it should work . user interface : well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , marketing : should user interface : i mean have something that 's little more technologically advanced than what 's on the market . marketing : that 's new . project manager : okay , now the trouble is is we 've already decided that we 're going with the stuff that works already , that 's cheap . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah . actually , i mean , these first two points we 've already sort of gone away from , marketing : yeah . user interface : 'cause our rubber one is not fancy project manager : yeah . user interface : i mean it 's different , but i would n't say like a rubber remote is fancy . if that 's what people want then we maybe we 're going in the wrong direction . and it 's it 's not technologically innovative either . project manager : maybe we could um marketing : so , no loose that 's why i was thinking , bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up bluetooth , and it 's like a bluetooth remote control , everybody 's gon na like , oh , 'cause bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and um when it comes to marketing like that 's what people go for , they do n't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . project manager : of course , they do . marketing : well , they do , but it 's like it 's not project manager : one hundred per cent , that 's your first thing , you go , oh i 'm not gon na buy that , 'cause i dunno if it works or not . marketing : yeah , but it looks good . if it looks good and it 's it can just be there for decoration . project manager : okay , well , what do you two think about this ? user interface : so is is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other marketing : but like project manager : yeah , what i do n't understand what m user interface : electronics ? marketing : you could always insert , yeah . user interface : yeah , that 's basically what it allows you to do , project manager : yeah , user interface : right ? project manager : and it this is just gon na all this is being used for is your television . marketing : yeah , but , i mean , people like project manager : it would that would mean you 'd need a television that has bluetooth in it , which no no television does , marketing : well , if you 're looking at if you looking at something that 's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . industrial designer : well project manager : does it ? that would mean we 'd have to make a television as well . industrial designer : bluetooth would , for example , enable you , i think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you 're being called by this person right now . things like that . project manager : no , that would be your telephone in with your television . user interface : yeah , the that would n't be the remote so much , project manager : yeah , user interface : i mean industrial designer : no , but if you get bluetooth on the remote , you 'd be able to project manager : nah , the televi the television would have to be a bluetooth compatible , basically . industrial designer : i with the television , yeah . i was just trying to find an advantage . wha what w what advantage would you get for the marketing : well , it does n't project manager : an and there is no there is no such thing marketing : like it does n't have to be , you know , bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . whether it 's a battery it could be something really really minor , you know , like but i think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people 've already seen it , people 've already got it . project manager : okay . marketing : if we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative . industrial designer : maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . it 's been done for watches , but i have n't seen that for remotes , yet . project manager : okay . yeah , this that 's that 's very good . marketing : and then you can market it . never have to change a battery again . industrial designer : change the batteries ever again . project manager : and and this is all tying in very nicely . marketing : project manager : the fact that it 's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . industrial designer : yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . user interface : yes , so can project manager : but yeah , by the squeezing it the marketing : i think , safety s user interface : yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator . project manager : yeah , that 's a great idea . well done . marketing : yeah . third most important aspect uh is it 's easy to use . user interface : we 're all about that . marketing : and i think we 've all um worked that out . um okay , in the fashion , how it 's supposed to look . next year 's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . so next year people will be buying , i found this really funny , you know , strawberry shaped chairs , industrial designer : user interface : okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : i wan na watch the pineapple channel . marketing : rubber things . um and as it 's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it 's it 's not quite spongy , but spongy , i would say is user interface : . project manager : well spongy , that 's where . yeah , we 're we 're ahead of the game there . user interface : yeah , that 's great for us . marketing : yeah , so we 're in . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . and so personal what i was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company 's image , basically . so yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : . i had to say user interface : right . marketing : so we 're moving in the right direction like project manager : alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , user interface : yeah . project manager : so through all that we 've we go we 're right , we 're gon na go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , industrial designer : yep . user interface : yeah , that 's great . project manager : that 's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-r_s_i_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , marketing : mm . project manager : and um i 'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . industrial designer : no vegetables . marketing : user interface : yeah , i do n't know how we incorporate project manager : . marketing : user interface : we do n't have to follow every trend , i guess . marketing : maybe make it like fruity colours or something . user interface : uh-huh . marketing : some sort . or user interface : the power button could be like a big apple or something . industrial designer : well yeah , but apple would sue you for that . marketing : project manager : yeah , this is true . user interface : they don they do n't own all images of apples . project manager : industrial designer : sued the beatles so user interface : okay , we 'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate . industrial designer : project manager : well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we have n't really finally um agreed on is its image . like , yeah , we 're we 're saying no we do n't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , user interface : . project manager : or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? marketing : well i think , if it 's rubber it needs to be project manager : i mean you said earlier on i it should be funky . marketing : different . i think , it 's it should be i mean , what do you associate with rubber ? you know like project manager : l keep it clean , keep it clean . marketing : really different colours basically . industrial designer : marketing : okay , sor i sorry , i used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? um industrial designer : marketing : um like i 'm just thinking bright colours . user interface : yeah . marketing : bright natural colours , nothing too project manager : bright , but not too bright . marketing : bright , but too not yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . wan na make it different colours so anybody can choo like like project manager : like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? marketing : yeah . and on the back of it have the logo . project manager : okay , what ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : sure . industrial designer : why not ? project manager : okay . tha user interface : the one thing i 'm wondering about , i hope that we 're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having project manager : yeah , i mean we that 's we we user interface : i mean if somebody go goes into the store they 're gon na see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . marketing : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : this is the remote control tomato . user interface : i mean what are ninety per cent of people gon na take ? marketing : well i can say in this country , you 'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , mummy i wan na buy that one . project manager : marketing : and uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it 's um like kids wo n't break it , it 's not breakable if you throw it around . project manager : yeah . marketing : especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and yeah . the only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but project manager : well , it 's it 's got ta be chew proof . user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : industrial designer : i 'm gon na write that down . marketing : so user interface : marketing : so it 's rea it 's quite project manager : marketing : it 's quite like um user friendly industrial designer : marketing : and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , i think . especially maybe younger girls if it 's in pink they 'll be like pink remote control for their room something . project manager : so , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different marketing : yeah . project manager : so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the industrial designer : that 's yeah . marketing : so like you walk in , you 're like , oh i like that remote control , because it 's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? and then they go like , oh i can choose the colour wow . so it puts , i think , even the customer into more control over what they 're buying instead of , you 've got all colour it 's either that or nothing . so they also get to pick . well , personally i like walking into a shop and choosing a colour . user interface : yeah i mean , that that seems to work well with for products like ipod , marketing : it 's um user interface : where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they 're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . marketing : yeah . mm . industrial designer : although i 'd be curious to see how many uh marketing : d you 've got the industrial designer : you know , there are some colours that i wouldn i would never choose , and i would be curious how many people choose that colour . project manager : well that 's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , user interface : right . project manager : if that 's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and produce less of the silly colours , maybe ."
