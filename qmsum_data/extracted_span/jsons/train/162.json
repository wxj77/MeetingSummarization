    "answer": "marketing : okay so number one . do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? industrial designer : feel i think . we 've been quite successful with the rubber coating project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and project manager : the look is a little bit more playful . user interface : well industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah i guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it 's definitely different . project manager : oh definitely different yeah . marketing : it 's not your traditional yeah . industrial designer : i think the colour has a lot to do with it . i mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype are n't the colours that i think we would 've necessarily chosen . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : it 's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek project manager : oh you were only given red and black ? industrial designer : red , black and yellow , and orange . project manager : oh okay . user interface : yeah so industrial designer : um user interface : not very sleek and we do n't wan na go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . marketing : yeah . user interface : so we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . project manager : yeah . okay . industrial designer : but if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something user interface : yeah . a metallic-y finish we were thinking . industrial designer : well i know know it 's for rubber . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours i think it would look quite fancy . user interface : polished . okay yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . i kinda i like the potato look . project manager : it 's mango . industrial designer : oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . user interface : we we were we were thinking about marketing : it 's very different . it 's what ? project manager : it 's mango . marketing : oh sorry the mango the mango look . industrial designer : potato 's fine . potato 's fine . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . totally . it 's really adaptable . marketing : so i myself would say a one or a two . project manager : yeah . i would say two . personally . user interface : i w i 'd say two i think . marketing : it 's a two ? industrial designer : for the marketing : okay , user interface : fanciness . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : fancy marketing : one being true . so industrial designer : i uh two , three . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay , actu that 's pro that 's gon na get confusing , like that . okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? so i know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah and the use of the rubber . marketing : use of the rubber , the use of the l_e_d_ . industrial designer : for the anti-r_s_i_ . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the l_e_d_ use is n't particularly innovative marketing : is n't industrial designer : and we do n't have any scroll buttons , it 's all pushbuttons , there 's no lcd control , so if we 're thinking about the rest of the market , it 's sort of probably halfway . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : in some aspects it is , like we said . project manager : yeah . i 'd say maybe three . user interface : i 'll go for three as well . marketing : yeah . and i think i mean it it 's tough to say because we were we did n't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would 've defeated the purpose . project manager : yeah we want it simple . industrial designer : yeah . though it was our specification . user interface : no . would n't be simple , yeah . marketing : so i mean i we 'll put three , but i think we actually reached our goal . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : we did n't want it any more than that . okay question number three . uh , will it be easy to use ? project manager : i think so . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah very . marketing : yeah . user interface : i think one for that . marketing : yeah . s yeah project manager : yeah . one . marketing : i think it 's industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : you ca n't really get confused with that . i mean , there 'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . project manager : the plus number thing . user interface : yeah that 's the only thing yeah . marketing : but once that 's figured out , it should be fine . industrial designer : yeah and perhaps the turning on but user interface : marketing : number four . is this a good-looking remote ? remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . user interface : it 's definitely industrial designer : again i think the colour comes into this . project manager : yeah colour will definitely be a factor . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i think that the logo could be smaller . industrial designer : okay . project manager : and maybe not such a prominent way . user interface : yeah . project manager : maybe like at the bottom , kind of . user interface : but the industrial designer : not in user interface : remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . project manager : oh it just had to be on there i guess . marketing : whoops . user interface : yeah . marketing : should just not touch it . project manager : industrial designer : do n't worry . marketing : this time it 's the three i killed . i was just wondering if it should be like flatter . or industrial designer : i suppose i 've got quite big hands . project manager : i like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . marketing : well user interface : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : but you know what i 've just thought of there now . what where 's it gon na sit in your living room ? is it not gon na fall off the arm of the sofa ? project manager : maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like marketing : yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . user interface : yeah . project manager : round . user interface : but then it would n't sit as comfortably in your hand . marketing : oh . that 's true . project manager : it would still be comfortable i think . we c we could handle it i think . industrial designer : thing is like that , it 's not going anywhere particularly . user interface : yeah . marketing : maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , so you would n't loo like if it 's flat here , so it sits up . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : like that . user interface : oh that would be nice . project manager : ah it 'd fall over all the time though . it 'd be annoying . industrial designer : uh yeah , it 's less um , what 's th ha . user interface : yeah . marketing : i g if it 's weighted maybe . project manager : user interface : project manager : 'kay we 're done designing . industrial designer : h it 's got higher centre of gravity like that . marketing : details , details . project manager : come on . marketing : okay . so , is this a good-looking remote ? would we wan na show it off to our friends ? user interface : three . you would though , 'cause it 's bit it 's more interesting than other remotes . marketing : yeah . project manager : i think , it was another colour and it was like i think it 'd look okay . i think maybe a two . marketing : yeah ? industrial designer : i would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , marketing : i mean i gue yeah , it 's personal taste , but user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but definitely in another colour , i 'm not happy with those colours . marketing : okay , so should we say two for that ? project manager : sure . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah ? user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . uh , question number five . what 's um will people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product ? remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . user interface : i think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : so people do n't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , i do n't want to spend twenty five euros . project manager : yeah . user interface : we have to market it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it . industrial designer : and the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , user interface : and the kinetic energy part . yeah . project manager : yeah . durable . industrial designer : ooh no . marketing : shake it and the buttons fall off . industrial designer : but you know , those 'll be firmly on . user interface : do n't shake oh no the plus . you 're marketing : no , i guess , i do n't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , user interface : use the zero . industrial designer : user interface : make a new one . project manager : but you 're our marketing expert . marketing : but i know i am , are n't i ? user interface : i think they 're about ten po ten pound , are n't they ? about ten pounds . fifteen ? marketing : but you do n't have to buy batteries . so in the long term this can actually save you money . industrial designer : mm , yeah , that 's true . user interface : yeah . project manager : oh . exactly . exactly . marketing : so we 'll market it that way too . industrial designer : yeah . good point . marketing : so yeah i think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it 'll user interface : project manager : yeah . i would give it a two still though . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah . okay number six . can someone read it out ? industrial designer : does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . marketing : or user interface : yeah . marketing : um yeah . so that was mainly that the statistics industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i think it does very well . project manager : oh yeah . industrial designer : because marketing : we said industrial designer : yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . user interface : the zap project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and it 's just you wo n't have to think about it . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : you do n't have to look down to find them . marketing : industrial designer : they 're clearly there , easy to use . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : simple . user interface : uh marketing : yeah i guess the i think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but they 're not you and i really . project manager : yeah . marketing : so . okay so one ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . number seven . c heather could you push it down ? will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . project manager : we have the alarm system . marketing : now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ? user interface : yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it 'll vibra industrial designer : it yeah marketing : industrial designer : l lights on and , or flash as well . but i mean it 's not obviously obvious from the outside that that 's gon na happen 'cause you ca n't s particularly see an alarm . user interface : it 'll be again in the marketing . project manager : i thought the light from the inside was gon na light up . user interface : yeah . the light it will . project manager : or or was it gon na make a noise ? industrial designer : yeah . but when the alarm 's not user interface : but industrial designer : yeah . if you user interface : but both marketing : project manager : you press the button it makes a noise right ? marketing : it turns into a duck and starts quacking . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you could s project manager : yeah . awesome . awesome . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : oh , that would be brilliant . marketing : here i am . user interface : i 'd be tempted to industrial designer : well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , marketing : um industrial designer : i mean , when it when it lights up as we i mean it could light up when the alarm went . but if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there would n't be any point . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so you ca n't see the alarm , but it would light up . user interface : it would have to be in the market project manager : i though w it was gon na make a noise . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah . alarm , user interface : yeah but you still could n't see it . industrial designer : but you ca n't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself . user interface : it would just be a little speaker on the back or something . project manager : okay . marketing : we oh you 're just explaining why it 's not on the prototype . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . it w yeah . marketing : but yeah , it 'll be there . project manager : oh okay . marketing : so we can we could say that project manager : whoo . okay . industrial designer : sorry . user interface : marketing : we can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . project manager : yeah , totally . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . um industrial designer : sorry heather . user interface : project manager : no problem , mm . industrial designer : that was n't very clear . marketing : question number eight . will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . project manager : totally . marketing : so it has to be yeah , it 's eas they 'll pick it up and they 'll know what to do . user interface : so the plu the plus w once that 's written down on the page that 'll be really simple , marketing : the plus thing needs to be worked on . project manager : yeah . user interface : wo n't it ? industrial designer : i think marketing : yeah . industrial designer : just because it 's we 've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , i think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . marketing : well user interface : yeah . marketing : do does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? so then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . project manager : yeah , so it 's just like channel six , six , enter . user interface : that kind of annoys me though , when it 's zero six when you have to press project manager : yeah but you do n't have to press zeros . user interface : i do n't know why . marketing : you could just press six enter , user interface : oh okay . right . project manager : and then like twelve , enter . industrial designer : and or sixty six enter , y marketing : or one two enter . user interface : alright , aye . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah i think that 's probably more straightforward . yeah . good project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : um , okay so we can user interface : i 'd say w yeah one . marketing : we 'll say yes it 's uh one ? project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : ooh . mm . marketing : question number nine . uh , will it minimise the effects of r_s_i_ , which was repeated strain injury ? industrial designer : injury . user interface : yeah . marketing : um , which affected over a quarter of users . user interface : hmm . project manager : i think so . it 's like right in the user interface : but if you 're zapping project manager : your thumb might get a little bit uh industrial designer : yeah , that 's what i was thinking . user interface : yeah . i do n't think it will f industrial designer : we may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we do n't know about . user interface : yeah , project manager : yeah . user interface : the biology . project manager : but it is soft . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : it 's soft , project manager : and that 's kind of what the um marketing : and project manager : the powerpoint slide thing said would be good for r_s_i_ , marketing : and people could industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so maybe it is but marketing : i do n't know what other options there are . industrial designer : i think we 're getting project manager : yeah . industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : could i mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . but there 's not really any other options unless it 's like a keyboard . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so , i think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . project manager : yeah . marketing : so , one or two do you think ? industrial designer : i think user interface : i i 'd say t industrial designer : yeah , i think too . user interface : two . yeah project manager : yeah . marketing : two okay . okay number ten . did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? project manager : yes we did . industrial designer : user interface : yeah . marketing : now is the colour gon na be there even if it 's like vanilla ? user interface : n we we ca n't really do that marketing : is the yellow user interface : because for example on the banana theme we ca n't have it as being yellow . industrial designer : user interface : it wo n't stand out . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : so n it 's not always gon na be the same colour . marketing : it sounds like the colour 's something that we project manager : well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : gray , yeah . project manager : so it could be grey on the banana one . user interface : yeah , could be grey . project manager : yeah . marketing : but i mean the yell yeah d yellow 's ugly though , user interface : yeah that 's right , marketing : depending on the user interface : we did n't even rea marketing : so i think we 'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the r_r_ . industrial designer : mm . yeah . i think this is the user interface : yeah . industrial designer : the factor that we 've been least successful in confronting . marketing : okay . user interface : perhaps a metallic project manager : mm , yeah . user interface : or or like that 's grey , and it would n't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . no ? marketing : yeah . user interface : that is n't rubber . marketing : and the buttons in the middle . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay so , do you think that 's more of a three then ? three , four ? industrial designer : four i think . well i do n't marketing : four ? industrial designer : what do what marketing : well we have good reasons for it , so we but we can still put a a four ? industrial designer : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : okay , and final question . um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? industrial designer : user interface :"
