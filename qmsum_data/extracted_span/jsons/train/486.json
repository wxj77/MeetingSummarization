    "answer": "the chair ( hon . anthony rota ( nipissingtimiskaming , lib . ) ) : i call the meeting to order . welcome to the third meeting of the house of commons special committee on the covid-19 pandemic . pursuant to the order of reference of monday , april20 , the committee is meeting for the purposes of considering ministerial announcements , allowing members to present petitions , and questioning ministers of the crown , including the prime minister , in respect of the covid-19 pandemic . i understand there 's an agreement to observe a moment of silence in memory of the six members of the canadian armed forces who lost their lives last wednesday in a helicopter crash off the coast of greece . we 'll return to order . colleagues , we meet today to continue our discussion about how our country is dealing with the covid-19 pandemic . as we do , canadians , like everyone around the world , are doing their best to live their lives until things improve . meanwhile , as we look towards the future , i believe that it is also important to remember our past and to continue to mark the important moments in our shared history . at this very moment , the dominion carillonneur , dr. andrea mccrady , is performing a special recital to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the netherlands by the canadian forces . in may 1945 , canadian forces played a major role in liberating the dutch people from nazi occupation . may 5 is now a national holiday in the netherlands that commemorates the event and the great friendship that now exists between our two countries . today 's meeting is taking place by video conference . the proceedings will be made available via the house of commons website . please be aware that the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee . let me remind you that , as in the house or in committee , members may not take photographs of their colleagues or film the proceedings . in order to facilitate the work of our interpreters and ensure orderly meetings , i will outline a few rules . interpretation of this video conference will be done as it is at normal committee meetings and in the house . at the bottom of your screen , you can choose floor , english or french . as you have seen , i change as i am speaking . i have now switched over to english in order to speak english . if you look at the bottom , you have a little flag that indicates whether it 's english or french , and that 's how we will be speaking . it makes it easier . that was where we had a little bit of a glitch in the last session . i understand that there are no statements by ministers . we can now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes . i would like to remind members that petitions presented during a meeting of the special committee must already have been certified by the clerk of petitions . in addition , to ensure that the petition is considered to have been properly presented , the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for petitions certified in a previous parliament should be emailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. on the day before the committee . i thank all the members for their usual co-operation . thank you all . now we 'll proceed to presenting petitions . our first petition comes from the honourable member for sherwood parkfort saskatchewan , mr. genuis . mr. garnett genuis ( sherwood parkfort saskatchewan , cpc ) : mr . chair , i 'm pleased to be presenting two petitions today . the first petition is with respect to government bill c-7 . petitioners raised concerns that this bill removes safeguards from the current euthanasia regime . it includes removing the mandatory 10-day reflection period and the number of required witnesses who will witness a person 's consent . the petitioners urge the house of commons to immediately discontinue the removal of safeguards for people requesting euthanasia , and to put in place additional measures to protect vulnerable people . this would require that bill to be amended or not passed . the second petition is with respect to senate public bill s-204 . this is on organ harvesting and trafficking . petitioners call on members of the house , and hopefully the senate as well , to support bill s-204 , which would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent . it would also create provisions under which a person could be made inadmissible to canada if they had been involved in organ harvesting or trafficking . thank you very much . the chair : thank you . i want to remind all the members that there are specific headsets that have been mandated to all of us . if you do n't have one , please talk to your it ambassador and they will get one to you as quickly as possible . the reason for them is not so much for what you hear , but that our interpreters are working and there are work conditions that really make it difficult . part of that is not having the appropriate boom on your headset , which will make it very difficult for them to hear and interpret for our members . now we go to the member for beacheseast york , mr. erskine-smith . mr. nathaniel erskine-smith ( beacheseast york , lib . ) : mr . chair , i had to learn how to tie my tie all over again . it 's been so long . i want to thank jenna robar , who 's led this petition e-2453 . the petitioners have noted that there are approximately 60 indigenous languages in canada and that 2019 , last year , was declared by the un to be the year of indigenous languages . they draw attention to article 13 of the undrip and to the trc 's calls to action numbers 13 to 16 . fundamentally , they call upon the government of canada to recognize indigenous languages as being official languages of canada and to have each language recognized nationally , with implementations on regional and provincial levels , acknowledging that many regions have different languages . mr. eric duncan ( stormontdundassouth glengarry , cpc ) : mr . chair , i am proud to present a petition on behalf of one of my constituents , myles lynch of st. andrews west in my riding . myles made history as the first canadian ever to survive three double-lung transplants . myles lives with cystic fibrosis and has had three lung transplants in the last five years , and he 's only 22 years old . myles created a documentary called 8 thousand myles , which had a few showings in my riding . it documented his journey across canada . one thing myles has been advocating for is the creation of a national opt-out program for organ donation . myles asked me how he could help raise awareness of that issue . i mentioned to him e-petitions online and getting people across the country to sign them . i am proud to have this certified today , with 1,318 signatures , asking the standing committee on health to launch a study into the feasibility of the creation of a national opt-out program . i give kudos to myles not only for his strength personally but also for his advocacy for others and for saving lives in our country by advocating for a better and an improved organ donation system . kudos to myles . i 'm proud to present this petition today . mr. peter julian ( new westminsterburnaby , ndp ) : mr . chair , i 'm very pleased to present this certified petition on behalf of several dozen residents of toronto , mississauga and brampton , ontario , who add their voices to those of the thousands upon thousands of canadians who have signed similar petitions . given that canadians are living through unprecedented , catastrophic climate events , and at the same time our society , as you know , is suffering from worsening social and economic inequalitieshalf of canadian families are only $ 200 away from insolvency in any given monthand particularly given the pandemic that we are currently experiencing , these petitioners are calling on the government of canada to support motion m-1 , a made-in-canada green new deal that i am presenting in front of the house of commons . it calls on canada to take bold and rapid action to tackle the climate emergency , and to put in place a shift to a clean and renewable energy economy . mr. gord johns ( courtenayalberni , ndp ) : mr . chair , it 's an honour to table a petition on behalf of constituents from courtenayalberni . they are concerned , obviously , about fentanyl-related deaths . over 12,000 canadians have died over the last four years due to fentanyl-poisoned sources . they cite that the current war on drugs has been costly and grossly ineffective ; that it has resulted in widespread stigma towards addiction and against those who use illicit drugs ; and that criminalization of particular substances has resulted in the establishment of a drug trade that now trafficks dangerous and lethal products such as fentanyl . they are citing that regulating to ensure safe sources , with proper measures and bylaws , will reduce the criminal element associated with street drugs . problematic substance use is a health issue and is not resolved through criminalization of personal possession and consumption . they are calling on the government of canada to declare the current opioid overdose and fenanyl poisoning crisis a national public health emergency under the emergencies act . they are calling for the government to reform current drug policy to decriminalize personal possession , as has been done in portugal and other countries , and to create with urgency and immediacy a system to provide safe and unadulterated access to substances so that people who use substances experimentally , recreationally or chronically are not at imminent risk of overdose due to a contaminated source . mr. brad vis ( missionmatsquifraser canyon , cpc ) : mr . chair , i 'm presenting a petition today that contains the concerns of canadians in my riding with the government 's approach to firearms legislation and regulation . the petition highlights that the liberal government 's december 5 , 2019 , speech from the throne contains numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation ; that the term military-style assault rifles is a political phrase undefined in canadian law ; that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions ; that the experts , including chiefs of police , agree that banning firearms and requiring law-abiding gun owners to follow more unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety ; that the majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into canada from the united states ; and that the liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs , drug traffickers and illegal gun traffickers responsible for violence in our communities . the petitioners in missionmatsquifraser canyon are calling on the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners ; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed , rcmp-vetted canadians ; and to focus our limited resources on anti-gang enforcement , on reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs , on mental health and on providing the canada border services agency with the tools they need to do their job effectively . the chair : very good . that 's all for petitions today . we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers . i would like to remind honourable members that no member shall be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair . ministers responding to the question should do so by simply turning on their mike and speaking . i want to again remind honourable members to use the boom on the official headsets so that everything runs smoothly , not only for ourselves but also for the interpreters . we start the question period with mr.paul-hus . mr. pierre paul-hus ( charlesbourghaute-saint-charles , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . although we are right in the middle of a pandemic and the government has agreed to set aside all parliamentary business in order to concentrate solely on eliminating the virus in canada and its impacts , the prime minister is deceiving canadians by introducing measures to punish law-abiding firearm owners . why ? right hon . justin trudeau ( prime minister ) : mr.chair , i feel that all canadians were affected by the massacre in nova scotia . once again , too many families are facing tragedy and tremendous grief . during the last election campaign , we promised to ban military-style assault weapons , and that is exactly what we have done . we will be working with members from all parties in order to continue strengthening gun control . it is a shame that , once more , the conservatives do not want to strengthen gun control in the country . mr. pierre paul-hus : mr.chair , i understand the prime minister 's reply . however , i would like to know whether he considers that , with this order in council , organized crime , street gangs and other criminals are simply going to turn in their weapons . right hon . justin trudeau : this is indeed only a first step , but it is an important one . we are doing other things to eliminate or restrict handguns in our municipalities , to strengthen the control at our borders , and to implement other measures . i am pleased to hear the hon . member speak of those measures , because we are going to work together in the house to strengthen gun control . i hope that the conservative party will be part of that discussion in a positive way , in order to keep canadians safe . mr. pierre paul-hus : mr.chair , i can simply say to the prime minister that the conservative party has always been committed to battling criminals , not law-abiding citizens . speaking of criminals , we know that , even before the pandemic , the prime minister had asked the parole board of canada to release prisoners more easily and more quickly . now we are learning that , because of the pandemic , some releases are happening very quickly . the minister of public safety told us that the people were approaching the end of their sentences or were older , but we are learning in the media that some dangerous criminals are being released . can the prime minister give us an explanation ? right hon . justin trudeau : the protection , the safety and the health of all canadians are important for the government . this is why we have taken additional measures in our correctional services to ensure that guards and inmates are protected . we have indeed opened the doors to some more speedy releases , but only in very specific cases that present little or no danger for canadians . we have managed to find the right balance . we must protect canadians and we must also ensure that they are safe . those two things go hand-in-hand . mr. pierre paul-hus : so is the prime minister confirming to us that no dangerous criminals have been precipitously released so that they do not have to experience covid-19 within the walls ? right hon . justin trudeau : there are very strict rules and principles to ensure that people posing a threat to society are not released . the chair : mr.paul-hus , you have one minute left . mr. pierre paul-hus : thank you , mr.chair . the chinese government has not been transparent with the rest of the world about the coronavirus . australia asked for an in-depth investigation , but has received threats from the communist regime . is canada going to stand by its allies in the five eyes and demand that the chinese government be completely transparent ?"
