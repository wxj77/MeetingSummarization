    "answer": "grad f : so it 's it it i guess it the begs the question of what is the meeting corpus . so if , at uw they start recording two - person hallway conversations is that part of the meeting corpus ? professor d : i think it 's i i think i th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key . grad f : well , this has two or more people conversing with each other . professor d : nnn , well phd e : yeah . postdoc a : well this grad f : they 're just not face to face . phd g : what if we just give it a a name like we give these meetings a name ? professor d : no , it does n't . right ? it has grad f : i mean , that was my intention . phd g : and then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people wo n't , postdoc a : well this professor d : yeah . grad f : that was my intention . so so s so part of the reason that i wanted to bring this up is , do we wan na handle it as a special case or do we wan na fold it in , phd g : and just give it a title . professor d : i think it is a s grad f : we give everyone who 's involved as their own user id , give it session i ds , let all the tools that handle meeting recorder handle it , or do we wan na special case it ? and if we were gon na special case it , who 's gon na do that ? phd i : well , it it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure , since we do n't want to duplicate things unnecessarily . phd e : it it it postdoc a : i think phd i : but as far as distributing it , we should n't label it as part of this meeting corpus . professor d : yeah . phd i : we should let it be its own corp postdoc a : well it 's it well , because grad f : i do n't see why not . it 's just a different topic . postdoc a : i ha i have an extra point , which is the naturalness issue . because we have , like , meetings that have a reason . that 's one of the reasons that we were talking about this . and and those and this sounds like it 's more of an experimental setup . professor d : yeah . postdoc a : it 's got a different purpose . professor d : it 's scenario - based , it 's it 's human - computer interface it 's really pretty different . postdoc a : yeah . professor d : but i i i have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they 're gon na do , but i do n't think i it it does n't match anything that we 've described about meetings . grad f : mm - hmm . professor d : whereas everything that we talked about them doing at at uw and so forth really does . they 're actually talking grad f : ok . so w so what does that mean for how we are gon na organize things ? phd e : yeah . professor d : you can you can again , as as i think andreas was saying , if you wan na use the same tools and the same conventions , there 's no problem with that . it 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's you know . it is different . you ca n't just fold it in as if it 's i mean , digits are different , too . right ? grad f : yeah , but those are folded in , phd i : it might also be potentially confusing . grad f : and it 's just you just mark the transcripts differently . so so one option is you fold it in , phd i : right . grad f : and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction . phd i : yeah , i th professor d : well , i don i would n't call reading digits `` meetings `` . right ? i mean , we we we were doing grad f : well , but but , i put it under the same directory tree . professor d : well grad f : you know , it 's in `` user doctor speech data mr `` . phd g : can we just have a directory called , like , `` other stuff `` ? grad f : other . phd g : and well or , i dunno . professor d : i mean , i do n't care what directory tree you have it under . phd g : and and just , um , store it there . professor d : right ? i mean that 's just a grad f : ok . my preference is to have a single procedure so that i do n't have to think too much about things . phd g : i mean professor d : yeah . grad f : and , just have a marking . professor d : o - you you can use whatever procedure you want that 's p convenient for you . grad f : if we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure , and someone has to do that . professor d : all i 'm saying is that there 's no way that we 're gon na tell people that reading digits is meetings . and similarly we 're not gon na tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings . grad f : right . professor d : those are n't meetings . but if it makes it easier for you to pu fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree , knock yourself out ."
