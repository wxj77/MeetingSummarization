    "query": "<s> what features did user interface think the remote control should have for its buttons ?",
    "answer": "user interface : yeah , and that 's fine . okay . so , basically , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people do n't like about existing products . so , in our case , existing remote controls . and then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they 're bad and good , which is n't always as obvious . we seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that 's not the case . then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that 'll feed into both ed 's work and christine 's work . um and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we 've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . so , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the tv on and off . you need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . you need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the tv to regulate contrast or whatever . so , the problems that people have expressed is that there 's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . the buttons it 's not clear what they 're supposed to do . um often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , um which you do n't necessarily always remember , especially if it 's a functionality that you do n't use very often . and that the buttons are too small . so , here we 've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . industrial designer : user interface : the buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . um they 're hard to see , and okay , they 're labelled , but the labels do n't necessarily tell you too much . whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that i think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed . and it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . so , i would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . and if there 's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . so my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , sorry , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple . project manager : click mm . user interface : which , i think ties into what christine and ed have both said fairly reasonably . um so , that 's pretty much it , an i do n't know if you guys have any questions or industrial designer : oh , it 's um , seems very understandable . clearly your research and uh and ours uh heading in the same direction , and um uh the only thing that i saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it . marketing : user interface : yes , that 's true . yeah . industrial designer : so uh , you know , but that 's okay . that 's why we 're all here at the table , so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it 's complementary . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh , when you hold it , is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design user interface : mm-hmm . yeah . industrial designer : and that 's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an industrial designer 's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and uh , you 're user interface : oh , that 's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gon na be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases , i think ."
