    "query": "<s> how did project manager and user interface introduce the prototype of the remote control ?",
    "answer": "project manager : yep . soon as i get this . okay . this is our last meeting . um i 'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . uh and then we 'll have a , the prototype presentation . um then we will um do an evaluation . uh or we 'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . then we 'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . um then we 'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we 'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . um let 's see , minutes from the last meeting . um we looked at uh the the trends . we had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . it was twice as important as anything else . um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . um and a spongy feel . so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . um looking at other other devices . um the ipod , we really liked the look of that . um we also had uh the kid 's remote for a simple idea . um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . but i think we 've still decided not to go with that . then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . so i 'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over . user interface : the prototype discussion . project manager : the prototype yeah . do you need a this ? user interface : no . project manager : okay . industrial designer : can try to plug that in there user interface : there is our remo the banana . marketing : industrial designer : but user interface : um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it 's basically designed around a banana . project manager : user interface : um but it would be held in such a fashion , marketing : user interface : where it is , obviously it would n't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . these would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . so that 's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . you have to use your imagination a little bit . and this here represents the screen , where you , where you 'd go through . project manager : very nice . user interface : and the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an ipod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . volume up and down . and then to access the more complicated functions you 'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . it 's that that simple . that just represents the infrared uh beam . that 's a simple on and off switch . um i do n't know , we could use the voice . t that blue bits should be yellow , that that 'd be where the batteries would be i suppose . and um that 's about it . it 's as simple as you , we could make it really . industrial designer : right . user interface : is there anything you want to add ? industrial designer : that 's what we have there . that 's plastic . plastic covered with rubber . we might uh add some more underneath here . maybe give it , give it a form . i mean you 're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so yeah , user interface : does n't make much make much difference . industrial designer : you have some rub yeah . user interface : you could work left-handed or right-handed i suppose . industrial designer : exactly , use both . might as well think about user interface : t the actual thing might be smaller . industrial designer : th think about the button as well . like either put either one one on either side or user interface : yeah . project manager : what but what 's that button ? industrial designer : not do it at all . it 's a quick on-off button . user interface : just the on and off . project manager : uh , 'kay . industrial designer : that 's um marketing : industrial designer : yeah i think it 's pretty important . so you do n't have to fiddle with that . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : right ? um that 's not um project manager :"
