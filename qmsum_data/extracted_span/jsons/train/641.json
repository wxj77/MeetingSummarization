    "answer": "mr. patrick weiler ( west vancouversunshine coastsea to sky country , lib . ) : mr . chair , i continue to be amazed by how the communities throughout my riding have stepped up to support our most vulnerable at our time of crisis . in many ways it has brought our communities closer together even while we stay physically distant . nowhere is this more true than on the sunshine coast . dedicated individuals immediately and organically mobilized the sunshine coast community task force to coordinate local government , non-profit and business efforts to provide critical services to the community . social enterprises banded together to form the sunshine coast food service response , which provides ready-made meals and donates to food banks . persephone brewing and others deliver groceries to at-risk customers both on the coast and on isolated islands . the 101 brewhouse + distillery and bruinwood distillery quickly retooled their business to supply much-needed hand sanitizer to local hospitals and other front-line workers . covid-19 , like all crises , has highlighted true leadership in our society , and i am grateful for what they and all of our health care workers do every day to get us through this . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the hon . member for medicine hatcardstonwarner , mr. motz . mr. glen motz ( medicine hatcardstonwarner , cpc ) : mr . chair , the prime minister and his cabinet have shown they 're unwilling to put the protection and safety of canadians ahead of political interests . they themselves are the greatest source of disinformation in this country . the prime minister told canadians that they can buy a gun without a licence . either purposely or because of ignorance , he left out the fact that doing so is a criminal offence with a five-year prison sentence . the minister of public safety said he would n't target hunters , but then he went ahead and banned numerous bolt-action hunting rifles and made owning a shotgun a criminal offence . they have weakened the ability to protect our borders . they have ignored our rampant drug crisis , and they have weakened sentences for serious crimes , all while saying they take these issues very seriously . today they tell us they are banning a new liberal-invented type of firearm , a military-style assault rifle . it 's time to be honest with canadians . the liberals would rather make people afraid of hunters , farmers and sport shooters than deal with the real issues like drugs , gangs , illegal smuggling and crime . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll now go to ms. sgro , the hon . member for humber riverblack creek . hon . judy a. sgro ( humber riverblack creek , lib . ) : mr . chair , it is in our most difficult moments when we truly see stunning displays of human spirit and generosity . on that note , today i wish to recognize the work of the humber river hospital in my riding of humber riverblack creek and to congratulate them on the success of their humber front-line support fund and ppe drive . not only have they been on the front lines of the covid-19 pandemic keeping our residents safe and healthy , but thanks to the generosity of those both in my riding and beyond , the humber river hospital has raised over $ 1 million and received over 400,000 pieces of personal protective equipment . this will be invaluable to the hospital as they continue to work with us and fight the good fight to keep us all healthy . i thank all those brave workers at the hospital , and i thank those generous individuals who have donated to this important cause . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : i now invite the hon . member for abitibitmiscamingue , mr.lemire , to take the floor . mr. sbastien lemire ( abitibitmiscamingue , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . i am honoured to speak to you about a proud warrior . stephanlavoie had made the choice to say thank you to life . for several years , he had been using his fight against cancer , which he led with the help of natural products only , to ensure cancer services and care were improved , particularly in regions far from major centres . mayor of preissac , in the rcm of abitibi , stephanlavoie passed away yesterday . i would like to extend my condolences to his wife , anabelle , to his entire family and especially to his daughter , astrid , who is only 20months old . through his humanism , stephanlavoie was a warrior , a visionary and a great source of inspiration for all of us . to me , he was above all the perfect model of a committed and loving father . my thoughts also go out to the citizens of preissac , to whom he leaves a dynamic legacy , and to the leaders of the abitibi community . in our first conversation , he said to me , and i hope the house will echo it forever , that all of our decisions must be made with our children in mind . stephan , rest in peace , dear friend . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the hon . member for montroyal , mr.housefather , has the floor . mr. anthony housefather ( mount royal , lib . ) : it is with great sadness that i rise today to pay tribute to tristan roy , after his tragic passing exactly two weeks ago . born in saint-fabien-sur-mer , tristan became a pillar of the montroyal community in1997 when he bought the old montroyal newspaper . when the city 's oldest newspaper , the tmr weekly post ceased operations , tristan registered the name and renamed his newspaper the tmr poste de mont-royal . he created a truly bilingual newspaper , ensuring that tmr residents could receive their news in both french and english . his editorials and views on local issues carried enormous weight . i join mayor philippe roy and the members of the town council in offering our sincere condolences to tristan 's wife , anne-marie , his daughter , aril , and his son , lancelot . we all considered tristan to be a friend , an example of what a good journalist and editor should be and could be . he will be sorely missed . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the hon . member for beauce , mr.lehoux , has the floor ."
