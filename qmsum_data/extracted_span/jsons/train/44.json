    "query": "<s> what did the team discuss about the product cost ?",
    "answer": "project manager : yes , well marketing : that 'll basically take us down to the budget . project manager : but i 'm now did y did you work with the same prices that i have here ? industrial designer : so i i give yeah i just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh i explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen fr euros . uh unfortunately we did n't see this chip , uh matthew , user interface : yeah . yep . project manager : mm , tha industrial designer : so maybe we have to recap with this one . user interface : maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah . project manager : well yes , well uh re reconsider it . so let 's let 's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : uh what kind of energy source uh i i we did n't speak about that . it 's a it 's a normal battery , or user interface : yeah , it migh it it 'll need uh more than a conventional one , it wo n't be uh just maybe you might use a a_a_ battery actually . what do you say , mael ? industrial designer : for this one it 's a normal battery . project manager : yes . just so one battery . 'kay . electronics . given speech recognition i think w you should go for the less fancy chip . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh sample speaker , yeah . project manager : yeah , yes , or sample sensor , yes . industrial designer : sample , yeah , this one . project manager : yes , this one . okay . case ? um , industrial designer : so user interface : curved . double curved yeah right . project manager : i see i user interface : it 's uh project manager : double curve . marketing : yeah , it 's gon na be more than just the biggest case , definitely . project manager : mm . industrial designer : so which one are we talking to ? user interface : are you talking about this or that ? industrial designer : well marketing : either of them . project manager : oh yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm . they 're both going to be not basic cases . project manager : but , actually bu industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so th th this would be double curves ? marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . project manager : 'kay . uh , plastic would be the material . marketing : yeah . the basic one , yep . industrial designer : is it zero franc ? user interface : a special colour ? project manager : uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers . user interface : uh marketing : so now we 're either going button or lcds , lcd display . project manager : push . mm , yes , but industrial designer : lcd is . it 's okay . just say lcd . marketing : is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ? project manager : yeah th now this is per per unit , this number of components . user interface : ah good . marketing : so it would need twelve buttons . user interface : yeah , we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? industrial designer : no but for this one it 's twelve euro . user interface : no , for that one also . industrial designer : there are twelve ? project manager : so , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , user interface : yeah that 's a scroll . project manager : t yes . twelve i believe . so this comes to eighteen . marketing : mm . and that 's without any special button supplements . user interface : yeah , one scroll wheel you might need . project manager : so marketing : so we 'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . they 're not just standard buttons . user interface : uh project manager : so i think but th do you agree th that thi industrial designer : wait a minute , it 's not it 's not double curved , it 's single curved , right ? because it 's there is no like . marketing : but i thought it would be curved on two it 's like it 's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that 's what i thought . project manager : yes i 'm i 'm no i 'm no i 'm not sh sure . yes i kno undes i understand what you mean , yes . industrial designer : it 's you know this curve like this so , it 's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are marketing : you talking about concave curves ? project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : yeah concave . project manager : both . industrial designer : so i think we can put um marketing : you think a single curved ? industrial designer : the single curved in the sixteen . that makes uh seventeen . and what are just the bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? yeah . project manager : yes . uh marketing : we have more , we 've got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah industrial designer : i had a bad uh bad estimation . user interface : bad estimate , marketing : the sc project manager : w d user interface : right ? project manager : we have we have n't talk about a , but that 's no a is very exp inexpensive i believe but it is not in the list . marketing : we 've got a scroll wheel for the volume do n't we , or is it some other thing that 's not on there . project manager : w ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ? industrial designer : no no no . marketing : 'kay we 've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . industrial designer : yes , a kind of scroll wheel . marketing : so this is even more than the um than the cost you gave , the sixteen euros . project manager : mm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay , user interface : industrial designer : so based on that , yeah , um where is the es okay sample speaker user interface : that is the sample sensor and sample speaker . project manager : so um industrial designer : but still , yeah it user interface : we just need that actually . we need one . project manager : we 're we we could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we ca n't have the the speech recognition , yes ? yes ? industrial designer : no we can not , yeah . project manager : so so w when we w a industrial designer : so project manager : this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . industrial designer : but the um yeah but if you have the near the lcd you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio , tv and v_c_r_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip . project manager : transti industrial designer : right , matthew ? user interface : oh i i it industrial designer : or regular chip ? user interface : i think it 's going to be y y industrial designer : i think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . user interface : yeah it 's th with the regular chip , yeah . project manager : say say it 's regular , regular chip , industrial designer : yeah . okay . okay . project manager : and we still on fifteen , user interface : yeah . project manager : so industrial designer : so . and what about the number of buttons buttons uh my matthew ? project manager : yes but that maybe well we can just say user interface : uh industrial designer : when you look at this w , this u uh item , user interface : yeah . project manager : ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . industrial designer : but project manager : so is it possible ? marketing : but that 's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : that 'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times . industrial designer : you can not make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really really low , project manager : user interface : project manager : no no , marketing : well project manager : he he he i i user interface : marketing : so the lcd display is is three francs , sorry three euros , by itself . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh we do n't want to to change that right ? we we really want a lcd user interface : uh project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . project manager : otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this . industrial designer : it 's evident . yeah . marketing : so twelve euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , industrial designer : and i dunno marketing : we ca n't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an lcd dispra display , that 's seven fifty um , so we 've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . and the chip . sorry the chip 's up there already . project manager : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . marketing : so we 're gon na have to scale this down to get within budget , there 's no doubt about that . project manager : a industrial designer : so wha what what each of us think about the because it 's measure point the lcd , um do you think it 's important ? user interface : or we could even replace them by buttons actually . industrial designer : because sometimes whe when you watch the tv in fact , you have a big display and maybe you do n't need one more in your hands ? i dunno , i 'm just asking . project manager : mm user interface : a actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you 'll have lcd display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two euros at least . marketing : mm . yeah . i think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the lcd display . user interface : okay so we can get rid of it industrial designer : yeah , it 's true yeah . user interface : and then add a couple of buttons . industrial designer : but uh , do we want that ? on the market point of view , yeah . what do you think uh , lcd is a major feature , or ? project manager : mm . i marketing : for the price , it 's gon na be what we can afford , and it 's looking like we ca n't afford the lcd display , there 's no way we can get it in there . mm . project manager : i think we have to come to a decision now , just i i think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the lcd uh display marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so industrial designer : you assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , right ? okay . project manager : yes . yes . one man one vote . industrial designer : okay . project manager : s so who thinks the the lcd disply display should be i should be in it ? marketing : i th i 'd like t it to be in but i ca n't see it happening . i ca n't see it fitting in . project manager : mm . mm-hmm mm-hmm . user interface : i think but industrial designer : we need to be . marketing : bu y you 're a power voter uh veto anyway as project manager . project manager : mm-hmm , i know , but industrial designer : yeah . . user interface : yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . marketing : well we have to make a decision now , that 's it . user interface : yeah . project manager : so uh uh having an lcd s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . is that acceptable ? ca can i have can the functions be implement in an you 've you you agree . user interface : w i i i just project manager : so hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . user interface : yeah . project manager : so that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons . industrial designer : because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . marketing : mm . i think then we we 're really losing ease of use . industrial designer : okay , . user interface : that will create another problem . for the people to use it . it 's not going to be easy . doing that . marketing : okay . project manager : mm . so um industrial designer : okay . project manager : i i think we should we should cut the lcd screen . that that 's that 's my opinion . user interface : no , it 's okay , you uh cut the lcd screen project manager : just user interface : and introduce two more buttons . marketing : okay . so lcd 's out , is speech rec out now ? we 've industrial designer : the speech recognition is out . because of the budget , yeah . project manager : uh where , l_c_ okay w we now we can just uh marketing : so are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . with these new costings . user interface : yeah . marketing : so just look at forget that one and look at that one now . project manager : yes . yes . i th i th i think w we just go for this one industrial designer : yeah ."
