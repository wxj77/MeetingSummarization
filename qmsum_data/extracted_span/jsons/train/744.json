    "answer": "phd f : start and end of each ? phd d : yeah . grad h : uh utterance . phd f : utterance . just marks ? grad h : so it 's implicit in in there phd f : yeah . grad h : but you have to do a lot of processing to get it . phd f : right . right . grad h : and so and also i 'd like to do the indirect time line business . um but regardless , i mean , w that 's something that you , me , and jane can talk about later . um , but i 've installed xml tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files , either uh information on users because the user database is that way i 'm converting the key files to xml so that you can extract m uh various inf uh sorted information on individual meetings grad c : cool . phd d : yeah . grad h : and then also the transcripts . and so l just let me know there it 's mostly java and perl but we can get other languages too if if that 's desirable . phd g : oh , quick question on that . is do we have the the seat information ? in in the key files now ? postdoc a : mm - hmm . grad h : the seat information is on the key files for the ones which phd g : oh in for the new one grad h : it 's been recorded , yeah . professor b : seat ? phd g : great . sea - yeah . grad h : where where you 're sitting . professor b : oh ! not not the quality or anything . no . grad h : right . professor b : ok . i see . grad h : `` it 's pretty soft and squishy . `` professor b : yeah . yeah . phd g : alright . grad h : oh , but that might just be me . um . phd g : alright . professor b : that 's more seat information than we wanted . phd g : never mind . i 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ? professor b : yeah . grad h : maybe we should bleep that out . professor b : mmm , yeah . phd f : wait a minute , professor b : yeah . phd f : how how w eh where is it in the key file ? grad h : right . the square bracket . phd g : cuz i mean i have n't been putting it in and in by grad h : you have n't been putting it in . phd g : right . postdoc a : well bu phd g : i have not . grad h : oh , ok . postdoc a : is n't it always on the digits ? professor b : some of these are missing . phd g : and professor b : are n't they ? postdoc a : is n't it always on the digits forms ? professor b : some fall out of phd g : well it grad h : yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . phd g : i mean they 're on th right , these , but i just had n't ever been putting it in the key files . phd f : yeah i i never phd g : and i do n't think chuck was either phd f : i never knew we were supposed to put it in the key file . phd g : cuz grad h : i had told you guys about it phd f : oh really ? phd g : oh , so we 're both sorry . grad h : but phd g : so grad h : i mean this is why i wan na use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text because with the plain text it 's very easy to skip those things . so . um if you use the edit - key , or key - edit phd d : edit - key . grad h : i think it 's edit - key , { comment } command did i show you guys that ? phd f : you mentioned it , grad h : i did show it to you , phd f : yeah . yeah . grad h : but i think you both said `` no , you 'll just use text file `` . phd f : text . grad h : um it has it in there , a place to fill it in . yeah , and so if you do n't fill it in , you 're not gon na get it in the meetings . phd g : so if right . well i i just realized i had n't been doing it and probably so grad h : yeah and then the other thing also that thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or crown mike , phd g : yeah . right . grad h : you actually have to say which one . phd g : i know yeah , i usually delete the phd f : oh ! ok . i did n't do that either . phd g : i do n't , phd d : yeah . phd g : maybe i forgot to d phd f : takes me no time at all to edit these . phd g : but it 's almost yeah . grad h : yeah that 's cuz you kn phd f : i 'm not doing anything . grad h : i i know why . phd g : and i was i was looking at chuck 's , like , `` oh what did chuck do , ok i 'll do that `` . so . grad h : and then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under `` participants `` they were filled in under `` description `` . professor b : ah , ok . phd g : uh grad h : and so that 's also a problem . so anyway . phd g : we will do better . grad h : that 's it . oh uh also i 'm working on another version of this tool , the the one that shows up here , { comment } that will flash yellow if the mike is n't connected . and it 's not quite ready to go yet because um it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not because the best quality ones , the crown ones , { comment } are about the same level if they 're off and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking . um these these ones , they are much easier , there 's a bigger difference . so i 'm working on that and it it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out . grad c : will that also include like batteries dying ? just a any time the mike 's putting out zeros basically . grad h : yep . yep . yep . phd f : but with the screensaver kicking in , it grad h : now phd d : y yeah . grad c : yeah . phd d : yeah . grad h : well i 'll turn off the screensaver too . grad c : oops . speaking of which . grad h : um the other thing is as i 've said before , it is actually on the thing . there 's a little level meter but of course no one ever pays attention to it . so i think having it on the screen is more easy to notice . postdoc a : it would be nice if if these had little light indicators , little l e ds for grad h : uh buzzer . postdoc a : yeah , a buzzer . grad h : `` bamp , bamp ! `` professor b : small shocks postdoc a : yeah . actually"
