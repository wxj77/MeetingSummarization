    "answer": "grad a : ok , um , let 's move on to electronics . phd b : ah . great . undergrad d : d we we out of tape out of disk ? phd b : no , we 're doing we 're doing great . undergrad d : i i was looking for the actual box i plan to use , uh , but i c all i could i could n't find it at the local store . but this is the the technology . it 's actually a little bit thinner than this . and it 's two by two , by one , and it would fit right under the right under th the the the the lip , grad a : yeah , does everyone know about the lip on the table ? it 's great . undergrad d : yeah . there 's a lip in these tables . postdoc e : nice . undergrad d : and , it oc i p especially brought the bottom along to try and generate some frequencies that you may not already have recorded . grad a : clink ! clink ! undergrad d : let 's see see what it does to the but this was the uh just just to review , and i also brought this { comment } along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table , and sort of w push them around . grad a : and and crinkle them and phd b : what ? postdoc e : and th `` that `` being a diagram . phd b : what ? undergrad d : that that 's the six tables that we 're looking at . these six tables here , with with little boxes sort of , uh , in the middle here . phd b : i see . undergrad d : which es would i mean , the the boxes are pretty much out of the way anyway . i 'll - i 'll show you the the cro this is the table cross section . i do n't know if people realize what they 're looking at . phd b : you trying to screw up the m the microphones ? grad a : yes . he is . absolutely . phd b : i mean th undergrad d : well why not ? i mean , cuz this is what 's gon na happen . you got plenty of data . i wo n't come to your next meeting . and and and you so this is the box 's grad a : get your paper off my pda ! phd b : yeah . postdoc e : yeah , let let the record show that this is exhibit two b . undergrad d : that 's right . `` or not to be `` . yeah , yeah . grad a : yeah . undergrad d : uh , the box , uh there 's a half inch lip here . the box is an inch thick so it hangs down a half an inch . and so the the two head set jacks would be in the front and then the little led to indicate that that box is live . the the important issue about the led is the fact that we 're talking about eight of these total , which would be sixteen channels . and , uh , even though we have sixteen channels back at the capture , they 're not all gon na be used for this . so there 'd be a subset of them used for obviously j just use the ones at this end for for this many . so excuse me . you 'd like a a way to tell whether your box is live , so the led would n't be on . phd b : right . all the lights . undergrad d : so if you 're plugged in it does n't work and the led is off that 's that 's a tip off . and then the , uh would wire the all of the cables in a in a bundle come through here and o obviously collect these cables at the same time . postdoc e : that 's good . undergrad d : uh , so this this notion of putting down the p z ms and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table grad a : right . well , we wan na do that definitely . undergrad d : or or right . right . and so the you we just epoxy them down or something . big screw into the table . phd b : velcro . undergrad d : uh , and even though there 's eight cables they 're not really very big around so my model is to get a a a p piece of grad a : sleeve . undergrad d : yeah , that that stuff that people put with the little you slip the wires into that 's sort of shaped like that cross section . grad a : oh . ok , not just sleeve them all ? undergrad d : yeah . i 'm i 'm r a i 'm going up and then i 'm going down . grad a : and leave them loose ? postdoc e : that looks like a semi - circle . phd b : yeah . it 's like a it 's a sleeping policeman . grad a : whoo ! phd b : speed bump ! postdoc e : sleeping pol phd b : speed bump . grad a : speed a `` sleeping policeman `` ! undergrad d : yeah , it 's like a speed bum an postdoc e : speed bump . that 's good . there we go s grad a : cool . undergrad d : and they 're ac they 're actually ext extruded from plastic . phd c : what is undergrad d : they sorta look like this . phd c : what does that mean ? phd b : that 's the s that 's british for speed bump , phd c : is it a speed bump ? undergrad d : so that the wires go through here . phd b : yeah . postdoc e : oh , is that right ? phd b : yeah . postdoc e : i never heard that . grad a : that 's really cruel . ok , so that undergrad d : s so it would c basically go on the diagonal here . phd c : it could go either way . grad a : so why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number ? phd b : yeah . phd c : i guess . undergrad d : uh , because the phd b : how else are you gon na distribute them around the tables ? undergrad d : because they 're there . grad a : well , ok , let me rephrase that . why two each ? phd b : oh , because then you do n't have to just have one each . so that if t if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box . undergrad d : yeah . and to see , thi this is really the way people sit on this table . th postdoc e : mm - hmm . undergrad d : uh . dot , dot , dot . postdoc e : which means two at each station . undergrad d : well that that 's the way people sit . that 's how many chairs are in the room . postdoc e : yeah . grad a : alright . postdoc e : yeah , i 'm just saying that for the recording . undergrad d : yeah . grad a : right . undergrad d : right . and certainly you could do a thing where all sixteen were plugged in . grad a : but then none of these . undergrad d : uh if if you ha if you had nothing else . grad a : right . n none of these and no p z ms then . undergrad d : yeah . right . right . i agree . phd b : only if you had well it depends on this box , right ? undergrad d : oh , true enough . and actually , at the m my plan is to only bring eight wires out of this box . phd b : exactly . grad a : oh , i did n't understand undergrad d : this this box thi - thi thi this box is a one off deal . postdoc e : that being the wiring box . grad a : oh , i see , i see . undergrad d : uh . and , uh , it 's function is to s to , uh , essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires , plus supply power to the microphones cuz the the he the , uh , cheap head mounteds all require low voltage . grad a : so so you 'd imagine some sort of in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d of these two and each of those one or what ? undergrad d : well i w i i the simplest thing i could imagine , i which is really , really simple is to quite literally that these things plug in . and there 's a there 's a plug on the end of each of these these , uh , ei eight cables . postdoc e : what phd b : yeah . postdoc e : ok . each of the blue wires ? phd b : but there are only four . undergrad d : an - and there 's only there 's only four slots that are you know , in in the first version or the version we 're planning to to build . postdoc e : mm - hmm . phd b : yeah . grad a : mm - hmm . phd b : yeah . undergrad d : so that that was the whole issue with the led , that you plug it in , the led comes on , and and and you 're live . grad a : oh , then it comes on . i see , i see . ok , good . undergrad d : now the the the subtle issue here is that tha i i have n't really figured out a solution for this . so , we it 'll have to be convention . what happens if somebody unplugs this because they plug in more of something else ? grad a : mm - hmm ."
