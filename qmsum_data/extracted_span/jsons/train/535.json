'cause certainly there 's lots of different information to go through . so um i 'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products . uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . um and then , as i say uh w we 'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um project manager : industrial designer : bouncing on top . marketing : dunno . okay . um . project manager : yeah . marketing : so this is what i 've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we 'll just read through together . um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . so they find them ugly . most people find them ugly . um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we 'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : okay i 'm gon na we 'll look at that in a second . um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . so i guess what we 're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they do n't does n't really appeal to them . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so i think what we 're doing is we 're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that 's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people 's hands . um , frustrations . they get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . um , takes time to learn how to use them . this is uh why i mention when craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it does n't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . if you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . um and i will admit i do n't know what r_s_i_ stands for . project manager : repetitive strain injury . industrial designer : is installing a new remote control something that people marketing : uh , no , that did not come up at all . um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . i also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . so i dunno if that 's possible we might consider getting into it . um . and and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wan na sell and market this , i think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that 's fashionable and sleek and trendy . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um people uh additionally are n't are n't liking the appearance of their products , so we wan na think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like . project manager : okay . marketing : you know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . project manager : so want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : yeah , so you know just c looking at what what craig um craig 's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wan na do is try and um separate the different things that we wan na include in this . so if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . you know , it 's like like i find a lot of tvs these days , something really like about 'em is if you wan na just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there 's just like tons of features you go through . project manager : mm . so it you wan na group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . marketing : yeah . project manager : that 's i think it 's a good idea . marketing : yeah . that 's s that 's sort of the um but i i 'm my hope here is that i 'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . project manager : mm-hmm . okay . marketing : um i i have n't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but not let that confine us technologically . project manager : okay . right . marketing : so alright ? any um comments on all of that ? project manager : well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we 're gon na be um who 's our our target audience , our target market . marketing : that 's uh project manager : um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? marketing : yeah . okay . project manager : i mean marketing : where 's the money , maybe . project manager : yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . well i if if like twenty five euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , marketing : yeah . and who watches tv . mm-hmm . project manager : well i do n't i 'm not really sure how much that will retail at . but you want it 's somebody who 's not gon na just use the remote that comes with their telly , i suppose , they 're gon na actually go out and buy one . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so , who do you think we 're aiming this at ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um , i think it 'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 'cause twenty five euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? project manager : it 's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , i think . industrial designer : is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? project manager : yeah , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : right . project manager : okay . industrial designer : um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . kind of . project manager : okay . industrial designer : you know how much ? i dunno i guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ? project manager : okay . industrial designer : like a simple replacement , right . i mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wan na go out and get , project manager : yeah . yeah , marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : would you how much would you pay ? marketing : this this kinda touches on your comments there , david . these are the age groups which we have information on industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . project manager : okay marketing : just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on tv equipment is . project manager : okay . marketing : mostly focused around the twenty five age group . project manager : yeah , so do you think we 're we 're aiming at a fairly young market then ? marketing : sort of young professional , kind of . mm-hmm project manager : yeah , okay . user interface : um project manager : um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? what what do you think , craig ? user interface : well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? sort of the the older group . marketing : uh , yeah , it 's the yep . it does it does fit with the market that we 're sort of identifying , project manager : n yeah . marketing : in terms of project manager : i think we are gon na have to narrow it down , to say let 's target these people and give them what they want marketing : okay . project manager : and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . marketing : yeah . sure . sure . project manager : so um anybody anything there to add marketing : yeah . project manager : just kind of young professionals , uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition , it 's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . so we could say that was our target . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : i i think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well project manager : yeah . industrial designer : because that 's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : you know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i think people who are maybe about i would n't say thirty five , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . but yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , sure . industrial designer : so these are people who are gadgety , right ? project manager : so marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : people who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : when you go on to their working lives , people who would you know regular project manager : yeah . so they 'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . mm . project manager : that that 's that 's a good point . marketing : yeah . project manager : um okay , so um industrial designer : project manager : so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition marketing : if we can . industrial designer : i i think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , project manager : if we can . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : because um , based on what you 've go y everybody 's saying , right , you want something simple . project manager : okay . why is that ? industrial designer : you want basic stuff and you want something that 's easy to use . speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . marketing : right . project manager : okay . marketing : could it be an on off thing ? like if you want it on industrial designer : but what i 'm saying is that we 're we 're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , project manager : where you can activate it and deactivate it ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we 're gon na say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : yeah . sure . industrial designer : so maybe we should marketing : sure . project manager : okay . industrial designer : i suggest that we think about speech recognition , marketing : yeah . sure . industrial designer : anyway it 's a it 's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we do n't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay ."
