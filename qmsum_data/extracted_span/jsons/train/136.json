industrial designer : yeah , that 's meant with scr uh with s curve . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : the curve is uh in a dimension . marketing : okay . industrial designer : if you make it a flat one , s n it 's no curve , you got no curves . user interface : so we would lose this one ?

project manager : yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition . industrial designer : the sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . marketing : that that 's uh user interface : yeah , but it 's t marketing : yes , four points . project manager : and then you can keep the curve . user interface : yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , project manager : or ca n't you ? user interface : it is something special . industrial designer : yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the marketing : yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? user interface : i do n't know . industrial designer : marketing : f you have to we have to scrap four points . user interface : yeah , that 's difficult . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : or make it on a hand dynamo , but i do n't think that will work . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : ma make it with wood instead of rubber ?

industrial designer : what we 'll have . let 's make it thirteen or fourteen . user interface : see , a po marketing : point twelve . user interface : three . we need point three . marketing : that 's a scroll wheel . user interface : uh it 's a colour . do n't make it wood . industrial designer : a colour . marketing : yeah , but a wood user interface : make it uh marketing : we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . user interface : yeah , but it 's it 's special colour , is it a all kind of colours ?

industrial designer : if we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen marketing : five ? then we have two . user interface : a push , yeah . marketing : touch . industrial designer : then it 's possible to make . and then you can and then you can add to the colours . marketing : then we can make add two colours on it . yeah , two colours it . industrial designer : special c user interface : switch colours . industrial designer : okay , if you lose uh if you lose the user interface : it was such a great idea . industrial designer : you lose this one , you got eleven point five marketing : they can add two colours . industrial designer : and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example . marketing : but the colours . um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or industrial designer : how d uh uh how many colours ? user interface : what do you mean ? industrial designer : special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p marketing : yeah , but we we we are we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . industrial designer : yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it 's a special colour . marketing : ah okay . user interface : but i think when you use the colour that 's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , industrial designer : i suppose . user interface : 'cause you have to add it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . user interface : yeah , so you always lose the special colour . you co you could make it always black , like normal remote . marketing : yeah b yeah , but we 're gon na make it yellow uh red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . industrial designer : nee we we also want to make ano another colour . user interface : oh right , yeah . yeah , we should u marketing : yeah , but m user interface : yeah . we have to make this like four or five or something . marketing : yeah , user interface : that 's what it means . marketing : because we have more colours than only black . project manager : yeah , but is n't it per remote that you pay ?
