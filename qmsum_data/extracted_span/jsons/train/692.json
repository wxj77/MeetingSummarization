    "answer": "phd e : yeah . but what would be interesting to see also is what what perhaps it 's not related , the amount of data but the um recording conditions . i do n't know . because it 's probably not a problem of noise , because our features are supposed to be robust to noise . professor a : well , yeah . phd e : it 's not a problem of channel , because there is um normalization with respect to the channel . so professor a : i i i 'm sorry . what what is the problem that you 're trying to explain ? phd e : the the fact that the result with the tandem and aurora system are uh so much worse . professor a : that the oh . so much worse ? oh . phd e : yeah . professor a : i uh but i 'm i 'm almost certain that it it i mean , that it has to do with the um amount of training data . phd e : it professor a : it it 's it 's orders of magnitude off . phd e : yeah but yeah . yeah but we train only on digits and it 's it 's a digit task , so . well . professor a : but but having a huge if if you look at what commercial places do , they use a huge amount of data . phd e : it mm - hmm . professor a : this is a modest amount of data . phd e : alright . yeah . professor a : so . i mean , ordinarily you would say `` well , given that you have enough occurrences of the digits , you can just train with digits rather than with , you know `` phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor a : but the thing is , if you have a huge in other words , do word models but if you have a huge amount of data then you 're going to have many occurrences of similar uh allophones . phd e : right . mmm . professor a : and that 's just a huge amount of training for it . phd e : yeah . professor a : so it 's um i i think it has to be that , because , as you say , this is , you know , this is near - microphone , phd e : mm - hmm . professor a : it 's really pretty clean data . phd e : mm - hmm . professor a : um . now , some of it could be the fact that uh let 's see , in the in these multi - train things did we include noisy data in the training ? phd e : yeah . professor a : i mean , that could be hurting us actually , for the clean case . phd e : yeah . well , actually we see that the clean train for the aurora proposals are are better than the multi - train , professor a : it is if yeah . phd e : yeah . professor a : yeah . cuz this is clean data , and so that 's not too surprising . phd e : mm - hmm . professor a : but um . uh . so . phd e : well , o i guess what i meant is that well , let 's say if we if we add enough data to train on the um on the meeting recorder digits , i guess we could have better results than this ."
