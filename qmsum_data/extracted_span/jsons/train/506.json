    "query": "<s> summarize the whole meeting .",
    "answer": "project manager : can i close this ? user interface : uh we do n't have any changes , do we ? project manager : oh , okay . user interface : so no . project manager : there we go . okay , here we are again . detailed design oh , come on . well ah s forgot to insert the minutes , but it 's about the same thing we discussed before . uh could open that anyway , think . other design anyway , we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time . we also that you 're just busy with it . took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features . well , we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the other screen , which is fine . um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black . yellow in the back because it 's m trendy , more trendy than black anyway . so then we ca yeah . we agreed that we would implement both the lcd and speech recognition , but i 'll get to that in a moment . 'cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway . so so , like i said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , but we have 'em now , and it 's bad . anyway . we are oh . prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype . so you could could present that . but um let 's see what be handy to do . nee no , you just go ahead and present the w we 'll scrap it later because what ? industrial designer : i think it 's more or less the same as we had . user interface : it 's basically what we agreed upon , project manager : oh that 's user interface : but just a little bit more specified . industrial designer : no much s project manager : has n't changed that much , huh ? industrial designer : no no no , not at all . project manager : i did n't expect anyway . you just coloured it . user interface : uh s final design . basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here . project manager : mm-hmm . i like the menu . user interface : we chose a different type of colour for the menu . a bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : if you put them all black , it 's not really that good a contrast . project manager : and i suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber . it 's it 's part of the rubber , i suppose . user interface : so probab project manager : i think that 's more i think that 's more durable anyway than printed on to user interface : yeah . that 's the be and it i guess it 's more easier to just paint it on the rubber industrial designer : yeah , of course . user interface : than to uh industrial designer : that 's uh the integration story again . marketing : mm yeah . okay . user interface : so we have it 's a bit round shaped , project manager : oh yeah . user interface : that 's what we had uh we chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so that 's basically what we chose there . project manager : okay . user interface : if you have anything to add , please interrupt me . industrial designer : no , uh this is just a description of what we see there . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so user interface : oh . industrial designer : speaks for itself . marketing : yeah . user interface : that 's pretty much it . project manager : okay . now it 's my time to ruin everything . well , not ruin everything , but no , nah . user interface : oh sorry . project manager : finances , that 's what we have here , what you drew . we have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . the sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway . so which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts . so well , we have sin one curve , a design . rubber design . and we had a special colour . suppose yellow is a special colour . so just half a euro for you have pushbuttons and an lcd display . you have the total of seventeen euros in production cost , which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . so , easy . what do we scrap . well think i had the best solution that i came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . user interface : i 'd say that too . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : because the lcd has more support on customer side . there are ninety one percent of uh the people , or something like that . but ninety percent who favour an lcd display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . i think it 's also harder to user interface : uh we do n't really have a extra function with the speech sample , marketing : yeah . user interface : which you ca n't do with a normal remote control , project manager : . so i ju user interface : which people already do . so project manager : i took that out . so and so it 's still stuck with thirteen , so i had to take out the special colour i suppose . and , yeah , i did n't see anything else i could take out . yeah , i could take out the push-buttons , marketing : pushbut project manager : but we need those . so , generally what i came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half euros , spe scrap speech recognition industrial designer : huh . marketing : special colour , yeah . project manager : and the separate covers can account for the if people want it , we 'll just then we 'll do it in black . we 'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it 's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . user interface : well , project manager : you make it d orange or whatever you want . user interface : i 'd i tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . project manager : it was a big issue , but user interface : so ca n't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? project manager : i 'll just go back . uh let 's just let 's see what okay , let 's just see what we no , we we have to be under twelve and a half . marketing : yeah , it project manager : it it 's not uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , industrial designer : okay , but there 's another problem . marketing : and the p user interface : okay . industrial designer : but there 's another problem . marketing : what industrial designer : if we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black does n't work obviously . project manager : i think you that 's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together . industrial designer : huh . huh . yeah . project manager : so i think yeah , it 's i think it 's y one of the it 's a good way to um to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too . just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we agreed before . industrial designer : right . i agree . project manager : and everything that 's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . but we need that for the lcd display . user interface : yeah . we do . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : then again , we have the lcd display , which is also expensive . b yeah , but those go together . and yeah , we could take out the curve . industrial designer : or say let 's lose rubber , take plastic . user interface : we could take out a curve indeed . project manager : could we could take out the curve . is that an option ? marketing : . project manager : for you ? industrial designer : although we are demolishing a little bit the style . marketing : but uh the and user interface : i think the colour is more important than the really the curve , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but project manager : user interface : because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control project manager : i think it 's it it does ruin it , marketing : yeah . the people project manager : but the fact that i t took that decision or t industrial designer : yeah . project manager : took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers . so you can change any colour you want . so it 's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . industrial designer : can we then not also uh change the material ? we take plastic for the basic cover project manager : you can take plastic , industrial designer : and project manager : but i d it 's something that 's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the marketing : spongy , yeah . industrial designer : we can put those to the to the other covers . project manager : and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , marketing : yeah . project manager : because they 're all plastic . marketing : and project manager : so which in in turn industrial designer : that 's true . project manager : rubber would increase durability industrial designer : but project manager : because it does n't break . industrial designer : okay . but what do you then suggest we 'd lose ? because we have to lose two things and i guess . project manager : i al like i said , i lost the speech recognition and i lost the special colour , marketing : but project manager : which would make this black a black and grey . industrial designer : okay , and that 's enough ? project manager : yeah , that 's that that that 's enough , because user interface : so black and grey is okay . project manager : i guess those are the basic colours . marketing : but project manager : so oh . user interface : which we can fabricate , project manager : i think those are basic col they want to user interface : okay . marketing : the people want to pay for for it , so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ? project manager : to ensure the profit . that that 's th that 's the order . we 're just uh we 're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company marketing : yeah . project manager : which say we do n't wan na spend more than twelve fifty for this . marketing : but we can take a risk . project manager : but that 's not for our that 's not our decision to take . we have a budget of twelve fifty per product . user interface : no , we basically marketing : okay , yeah . project manager : so user interface : we need to stick to that . project manager : stick that . i do n't think it 's really bad either . i mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing marketing : i hope the people will like it , project manager : to have marketing : but project manager : i think they would do . th i think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , marketing : project manager : because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . marketing : yeah . project manager : so i think it 's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect industrial designer : perhaps we should make m marketing : yeah . project manager : and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . marketing : the first sheet . project manager : so industrial designer : perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . and that 's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that . project manager : well i do n't think yeah . is it worth is it is it industrial designer : perhaps they decide tha user interface : but they do n't project manager : does it mean anything to the customer ? like , it like , we do n't care we do n't care that you had to industrial designer : of course . perhaps they uh no , but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let 's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs . project manager : true , industrial designer : we ca we uh we can at least tell them that project manager : but we did we did n't get that . so i think it 's industrial designer : you do n't know that . project manager : it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something . user interface : well project manager : but industrial designer : no , i 'm not uh talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this . we could at least m uh make it like this , like you said , project manager : they could , but uh industrial designer : and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . it is an still an option , but not for this price . project manager : it 's an option , but yeah , it 's true . so actually uh it 's not that much of an increase , but yeah . we can not contact them . user interface : and if we project manager : it 's just the order that we got . industrial designer : exactly , project manager : so that 's what we got ta go with . industrial designer : but marketing : yeah . project manager : so it 's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final , it 's either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , marketing : yeah . project manager : um or turn it yellow . so it 's uh something we have to decide on . industrial designer : i 'd say lose the curve and the colour project manager : i say lose the curve . oh that 's true , industrial designer : and project manager : we could lose the c i forgot that , yeah , sorry . uh the curve . so user interface : so which curve is that ba project manager : that 's just this one just d this is the banana curve . user interface : that 's basically that curve . project manager : so this would this would be straight . user interface : so we could u still have the comfort . marketing : yeah , that 's better . project manager : no , uh no , that would be a curve inside the thing , i guess . no , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . just like like that . which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . we could make it yellow then , user interface : i second that . project manager : but you second that , you second that we lose the curve . user interface : no , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . project manager : okay , yeah . user interface : so that 's not really that marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : so i think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . so we keep the curve . so the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . user interface : i would project manager : and i 'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has . industrial designer : oh . i agree . user interface : yeah . i would say i would agree with you on the colour , because that 's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah , um user interface : so we can always do that . project manager : i guess people are willing to pay for that . so i think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . marketing : yeah . project manager : so i think that would still make it a nice product . okay , we 're final on that . so it 's too bad we ca n't make the whole super thing . but anyways we 're here . um yeah . user interface : which is basically what we discussed . project manager : this we discussed just now . that 's just now just we could just discuss how the project went . i mean , was kind of marketing : and i want to do that . project manager : i sort of expected that everything would turn out this way , but because you yeah , everything can not be for free . we did n't i think it was too bad we did n't have the financial info the last time . because that was i th it was really essential really user interface : we could have project manager : to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost . so we just put something marketing : yeah . project manager : i think it 's really nor not in stroke with reality actually . marketing : project manager : so industrial designer : me too , i felt a bit blind throughout the project , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : because in the beginning i had no list of available materials , project manager : yeah , i think would have been . marketing : yeah . project manager : materials would be ok industrial designer : and then i d had not list of available c finances . marketing : but project manager : at least the last meeting i would have expected had to have that . industrial designer : so project manager : so i suppose marketing : let 's um see um project manager : yeah , let 's see if it sells . i mean i suppose this sells , because it 's very very extended . marketing : um project manager : but user interface : well i hope it sells . marketing : let 's uh project manager : i suppose it sells , because it 's good . i mean it 's got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we did n't know what it 's gon na cost anyway . marketing : hmm . okay , let 's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . um i have some uh a method , a requirements and scale of . i uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it 's true or false project manager : okay . marketing : and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not . project manager : have been met , okay . marketing : and i will uh make a new blank sheet project manager : yeah . marketing : so so the buttons , the look and feel . i thought it was okay , but the advanced uh settings , um screen , audio and channel project manager : they 're stuck under menu . user interface : which are basically accessible through the menu button . marketing : we are not project manager : for the menu . i think those are totally met , because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want , marketing : oh the menu button is it . user interface : yeah . marketing : hi oh , okay . project manager : they have the simplicity they want . marketing : then it 's all uh s project manager : i think it 's very uh very well met . either two or one maybe . marketing : it 's true . project manager : i think we took that everything they wanted into consideration . marketing : yeah . project manager : so it could either be a two or a one . marketing : so d oh wait . uh pen . project manager : one and a half . user interface : which is not an option . marketing : the p oh yeah , project manager : just create our own option . marketing : it 's red , okay , but look and feel is everybo it 's true . project manager : yeah . marketing : so anyone ? and the next one uh yeah , when it 's lost uh you can find it . project manager : it 's perfect . even for deaf people , yeah . marketing : it 's project manager : it 's i do n't think it 's perfect , but we did everything possible to to get it back . user interface : to make it that way , yeah . project manager : because if it 's stuck in you couch , you can see the light . maybe you can hear it . but i mean we tried , marketing : yeah . project manager : so i think it that 's that deserves a one . definitely . marketing : and it 's and it 's yeah . to . that 's okay then . and the next one . how is that ? uh w we had we do n't have an uh manual , industrial designer : manual . project manager : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think the lcd display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , marketing : but i think that 's a part of it . but project manager : i 'd use an remote control . user interface : mm yeah . industrial designer : but then again , it 's for young people . so marketing : yeah , an lcd , it tells a lot about uh user interface : and it 's pretty straight-forward , industrial designer : yeah , i th project manager : it 's pretty straight-forward , uh-huh . user interface : you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the lcd menus . industrial designer : exactly . no , that 's true . i think it wo n't be a big problem . marketing : yeah . user interface : so marketing : so it 's a one user interface : one i d no , marketing : or a i do n't know . project manager : i think but we did n't even marketing : for the advanced uh settings . project manager : there was no issue on making a manual actually . we did n't really discuss it , marketing : no okay , that uh that 's true . project manager : but i do n't think it takes no , it really does does n't take time to learn , i think . we took it s it 's so easy , user interface : no , it it is pretty straight-forward . marketing : oh , so it project manager : we have so little button , everything speaks for itself really . so i think that 's industrial designer : ah . um project manager : yeah , we did n't it 's either two or one , i guess . marketing : takes no ti project manager : maybe it 's a two , because d uh the lcd is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button . industrial designer : with the more important functions on . marketing : yeah . project manager : so i might make this a two instead of a one , i guess . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : and the lcd , you have to see it . project manager : so just make that a two . marketing : um mm oh , it 's a little bit learning . okay . uh yeah it 's uh a little bit same . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : but it tells you or not ? project manager : you can use the lcd in a good way . i think so . i think it 's perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful . i think so . marketing : but wha w industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : oh , yeah . what are we uh displaying on the lcd screen ? just uh only the channels and or industrial designer : the menus uh things like brightness and uh those kind of things we 've put in the menu , marketing : what uh ? industrial designer : because we have no buttons for those . user interface : well , basically the menu options indeed . but marketing : oh , in the lcd screen . project manager : no , y i mean in the lcd screen , the small screen . what does it display ? marketing : and for a channel selection , uh or that 's not project manager : well i thought it was i thought it was i thought that people wanted previews on their i 'm not sure if that even possible , marketing : yeah , i thought i thought too project manager : but marketing : but project manager : 'cause it 's this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width . marketing : yeah . project manager : i do n't think it 's possible really . but the they did n't really define in what should be used for . marketing : maybe a tv guide or something in your lcd uh project manager : but i think in for example like tv guides , i think that 's that th that you can transmit through it and everything . just for extra information on your programmes . marketing : yeah . yeah , it must be clear then what what what for we use it . project manager : but also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : so that could be done by lcd display . i think it 's good . no , maybe it 's not a one because it 's we 're not using it perfectly . we did n't give it i do n't thing over-discussing . now we gave it enough thought though . i think we d should just lower this . marketing : yeah . project manager : maybe maybe it 's a three though . we could 've used it more effectively probably . marketing : yeah , indeed . project manager : marketing : so everybody 's agree with an uh three on it , project manager : yeah , we are using it , user interface : yeah . two or three . marketing : it 's project manager : but it 's not it 's not poorly used , but it 's not efficiently used , i think . user interface : so marketing : yeah . project manager : we could have ev even lost the selection button and uh done everything via lcd selection . marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's now it 's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features , marketing : yeah , i project manager : but okay . marketing : a three . industrial designer : nah , it 's not really only an extra . user interface : you can seven . industrial designer : no menus . marketing : ah , nothing , that 's a seven . uh that 's uh industrial designer : think about project manager : can you talk to remote control ? user interface : or we could say it project manager : well , it ca n't talk anymore . so we scrap that . marketing : yeah . user interface : or we could say neutral , project manager : oh yeah user interface : we 'cause we scratched the project manager : just to be a prick , but of course you can talk to your remote control , it does n't do anything . marketing : yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager : but you c you can talk to it . marketing : not with the speech recognition . uh yeah , all the trends and no colours uh anymore . so project manager : well , we did take everything into consideration of course . uh the shape i shape is i marketing : yeah , uh um only in the curves . project manager : i think we yeah , i think that 's okay . marketing : but the colours , we do n't have special colours on it . user interface : no , we do n't have the colour . project manager : yeah , special co but we took into consideration the fact that it 's customisable user interface : so i marketing : yeah , project manager : to the fashi marketing : but we user interface : yes , but the end product so marketing : yeah , we do n't have it , so d project manager : we do n't have it we do have it , marketing : in the end product . project manager : it 's just sold as a package . industrial designer : but m project manager : it does it 's not part of the basic product . industrial designer : changing covers is also trend that we followed . project manager : it that that 's what i call trendy . i mean the shape is trendy . user interface : project manager : the the sh the the functions are trendy . it 's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . because you ha marketing : now project manager : it 's just not affordable at the moment . user interface : maybe we should go with a two then , marketing : but it 's not a one . user interface : because it 's not perfect , because we ca n't do it initially , marketing : yeah . user interface : but we project manager : it 's possible , industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : oh . project manager : but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour . marketing : oh well oops . project manager : marketing : oh it 's a two , user interface : yeah . marketing : right ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : on the last one . uh that n that 's all . project manager : overall score . user interface : overall score . marketing : overall . it 's um project manager : one two three . sixteen . marketing : ten , sixteen three uh two project manager : two two point some two point something . marketing : two point seven or something like that . i do n't know why . user interface : ten , sixteen , divided by project manager : . user interface : is two two third . project manager : two and two thirds . marketing : um so project manager : marketing : we can say it 's it 's the product is it 's okay . project manager : it 's okay , but that 's yo m marketing : y not industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : mostly it 's it 's influenced by the fact that we did n't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . user interface : there 's industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : 'cause yeah , that gives you a seven , which ruins your your average . marketing : yeah . project manager : without that it would be like under it would n't yeah , it would be under two . so i think we have even with this it 's reasonable . marketing : woah . user interface : yeah , if we make it into a four , as in neutral , because we did n't implement it , so we ca n't say that we that it 's really not well implemented . we come out on a average of two one eighth . marketing : yeah . project manager : well i think it 's two is okay . user interface : so which is pretty w good . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah , two is pretty good . user interface : it 's at least on the positive side . project manager : definitely . user interface : so we could definitely have done better if we 've had more resources , industrial designer : hmm , of course . marketing : yeah . user interface : but project manager : yeah , i think it 's probably i industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . project manager : i do admit that we d did miss a little or did n't sp did n't talk talk enough about the possibility of the lcd display . we could have used it more efficiently , marketing : yeah . project manager : we just did n't think of it that way . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , with . .. # user interface : true . project manager : so like i said , changing channels , everything hidden in your lcd display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything . marketing : the scale . industrial designer : but i think for this price , this is it 's really a reasonable product . project manager : i think we div i think we did very well , industrial designer : it 's a good product . project manager : uh ev even if you look at this score , we did quite well . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : oh . oh . yeah . marketing : with an lcd screen . project manager : it just looking for improvements what what you could have improved . so . industrial designer : but if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it 's can not be done for this . project manager : they sh they should get kids , and just stick 'em in tv and say change the channel . marketing : yeah , user interface : marketing : you can make 'em another one . industrial designer : hmm yeah . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : ah but for this price uh you can not ask that . project manager : i don ' think so . uh it 's just not it it 's not affordable . industrial designer : you can not th think of that project manager : or your sh you should lose the lcd screen probably , industrial designer : no , it 's not . project manager : but i think that 's i think the lcd screen is more worth than speech recognition . industrial designer : mm-hmm . oh it 's also more attractive . project manager : definitely . okay , that was that . marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : so that 's the final product without the speakers , i guess . user interface : so did you project manager : let 's see , what was left in the the another one . hmm . yeah , marketing : project manager : we evaluate the product . general project , what 's i in for example , i thou i thought we were pretty creative in what we created . we took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , which i thought was pretty creative , because it was never never ever listed somewhere . marketing : favourite channel . project manager : well anyways . yeah , leadership is up to you . i mean perhaps i screwed up because i d put a put a speech recognition into it . but that 's not for me to decide . marketing : yeah , i know . yeah . project manager : i think we did pretty well as team-work though . because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you can not communicate in the meantime , industrial designer : yes . hmm . project manager : because when i got the when i got the input for the financial results , initially of course i wanted to contact you . marketing : yeah , you 're working separate . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : say , look , this is you 're doing the wrong thing , marketing : yeah . project manager : you 're s you 're wasting your time now , because we 're implementing stuff that we can not afford . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , yeah yeah . project manager : so it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh marketing : yeah yeah yeah . direct uh communication with yeah . project manager : because that 's that 's what would w you what you would normally do , either call or email someone . user interface : and we could share information which we received . project manager : so that was too bad con was impossible here anyways . . industrial designer : that 's the same thing that i had in the beginning . everybody was using materials that s i did n't have . project manager : it did n't have industrial designer : so project manager : or did n't knew what they costs or whatever . marketing : yeah . project manager : there was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . user interface : yeah . project manager : so that was a little unclear i suppose . i think a smartboard smartboard is pretty cool . i think uh s especially for design issues , it 's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it 's easier to share them . marketing : my handwriting is little bit yeah . yeah . user interface : although for actual design i 'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , project manager : it 's a little less it the response time is le it 's very bad . user interface : because project manager : it 's good to visualise everything , but i think the response time should could be a lot better . user interface : the digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that . marketing : but th that 's project manager : definitely . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah , it 's true . marketing : yeah , okay . user interface : so industrial designer : but there 's uh also one problem with this i noticed . uh you have to finish a page before going to a n project manager : no , you do n't have to . no , you do n't . i jin i did n't check the finish button . marketing : you can project manager : i just you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever . marketing : done and then it 's okay . industrial designer : okay , i saw that uh project manager : uh only if you uh check the notes or press done . then it um then you can then it exports to word automatically . but it 's not necessary to check either one of those two . industrial designer : yeah , project manager : you can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme . industrial designer : but i made marketing : oh , okay . industrial designer : okay , but i made three pages marketing : okay , yeah . industrial designer : and they were not finished . and when the third one was finished , i wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further . project manager : okay , before starting a ne a new page . marketing : okay . project manager : okay , that could be b . industrial designer : exactly . so we can not work on more than one page at same time . that 's not possible . project manager : okay . industrial designer : you have to finish it completely , user interface : oh can you ? okay . industrial designer : then download it , it 's then start a new one . project manager : yeah , okay . industrial designer : that 's not very uh handy , project manager : that 's industrial designer : but if you know that , then it 's not a problem . project manager : yeah , it 's understandable , okay . any new ideas ? yeah , more communication between between uh that 's the thing i noticed , that communication is very um very important , industrial designer : marketing : important to mm project manager : because if you get new information , it 's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side . marketing : yeah . project manager : so i think that could have been better . but that 's i think it 's more of a a setting here that you can not communicate than uh than somewhere else . so user interface : yeah , well it could also possibly be well , is it a more real-time information base , so we can all see which information is available to one another . project manager : yeah , i think so . and l less p less spam probably . i 'm not sure i i 'm not sure you got spammed as well , industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : but i get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something . industrial designer : ah . well project manager : so which were totally useless actually . i thought i should probably look into them , but they were all useless . so i just user interface : well , i personally did not have that , marketing : mm project manager : oh okay . user interface : but that 's probably your l description . project manager : user interface : but i also did n't not really . but still , you had that as well . is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and then there was just extra information . marketing : yeah , after after five minutes , uh industrial designer : . user interface : there was a little delay in the bit of a c crucial delay . industrial designer : yeah , marketing : yeah . project manager : i did n't have any uh more information , it 's just always the same here . so that 's that 's kind of a marketing : email uh project manager : it would change , but not for me . so i 'd i had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually . i could n't do any research myself or i see , that 's yeah , w i could have done a little extra work probably , then marketing : it 's project manager : but i was busy enough anyway . so marketing : yeah . project manager : any new ideas found ? or is that a 'cause uh yeah , it 's well , probably is . user interface : how much time do we have for this anyway ? project manager : i have no clue . that 's like oh , but it should i industrial designer : . project manager : if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget , we should celebrate . so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay , marketing : industrial designer : bring out the beer . user interface : champagne . project manager : uh okay , think that 's about it . uh marketing : i want one for my own . project manager : i 'm not sure what we should still do though uh t let 's see what all your tasks were finished , right ? what you ha from your assistant . so let 's marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i have no more email . my coach is uh being very silent now . project manager : okay , marketing : yeah , project manager : i should i think i sh marketing : my personal coach i project manager : i still have the the total report to finish up . i think we took very little time now , because yeah , we 're in agreement , everything the design is okay . the one thing we missed though , we do n't have a product name . marketing : what project manager : how about you cook a how about you cook up a product name ? user interface : product name . industrial designer : we have n't think above about that . marketing : yeah , name . industrial designer : huh . it 's better than thi i think than a serial number . sony uh t_r_ something uh f means nothing to me . uh project manager : just marketing : or fruit name . project manager : oh , think of a catchy name . i 'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps . so industrial designer : like fruit names . marketing : fruit name or something like that . project manager : what ? fruit ? marketing : the banana remote or something . project manager : you do n't want it to resemble a banana . marketing : i do n't know . yeah , it 's the form of it . project manager : it 's not yellow anyway . user interface : the bana 'cause it 's not yellow anymore . project manager : it 's not yellow anymore . marketing : yeah oh , yeah . project manager : it is curved , but marketing : uh yeah . uh user interface : well , uh i was going for the r_c_ deluxe , but it 's not really a catchy name or anything , it 's more project manager : it 's industrial designer : uh at least it 's not something with numbers . numbers are so meaningless to the people . i mean marketing : yeah . user interface : something with our company name , marketing : that 's true . user interface : can we do anything with that ? industrial designer : . user interface : maybe there 's something on the website which will help us out . marketing : reaction , real reaction . project manager : industrial designer : real reaction . user interface : the reaction deluxe . project manager : real reaction future r_c_ . step into the future of of remote controlling your tv . user interface : is that a name or a c campaign ? marketing : project manager : no that 's a that 's a catchy slogan . user interface : yeah . project manager : control your remote control . user interface : or the the real reactor . industrial designer : real react . project manager : i go for future r_c_ probably . something like it 's short f industrial designer : the real reactor , i do n't find that uh that bad at all . marketing : . project manager : real reactor ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh that that 's user interface : you should write it down as a an option . industrial designer : because our name is real reaction . project manager : that makes me think of different products than a remote control really . marketing : . user interface : project manager : i 'm not sure . real reaction in a real marketing : zapping . the user interface : so that 's one option . project manager : real reactor . did n't notice . industrial designer : i 'm looking for things in the name . so that the first three letters are s the same . r_e_a_ r_e_a_ . user interface : should i write the banana down or project manager : i take f marketing : yeah , sure . project manager : yeah , take a banana . user interface : sure ? marketing : the banana . remote . banana recei r_c_ . industrial designer : the triple r_ . real reaction remotes control . triple r_ . marketing : remote . user interface : well i marketing : r_ three c_ . user interface : uh do you mean it like industrial designer : ? marketing : r_ three c_ . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : you mean it like this ? industrial designer : yeah , that marketing : real reaction remote control . r_ three c_ . oh yeah . industrial designer : . . project manager : no , not like that . it should be it should be longer , because it 's not a product name that you f print on a box . industrial designer : i think triple r_ . project manager : just write out triple , like a word triple r_c_ , triple stripe oh . triple dash r_ dash s s c_ . industrial designer : does n't sound ? marketing : yeah , triple r_ . industrial designer : yeah . ah . marketing : triple r_c_ . the triple r_c_ , yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : r_ s r_ three c_ . . project manager : r_ dash c_ . user interface : dash c_ ? industrial designer : i think i like it like this more . project manager : dash . triple r_ or triple r_c_ ? user interface : like a c_ right now or a dash in a c_ ? marketing : triple r_ dash . project manager : how about do both ? user interface : project manager : sure if it looks stupid . uh i think that the the r_c_ together takes away the the the image of it 's a triple uh the first the first one looks like it 's a triple remote control , marketing : that project manager : but it 's only a single remote control . and it 's especially on the triple r_ that 's important . the real reaction remote . industrial designer : i would huh . i would lose the c_ marketing : yeah , this yeah . industrial designer : and just name it triple r_ . user interface : is it triple r_c_s ? no . project manager : industrial designer : it sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it . marketing : triple remote . industrial designer : i would just say triple r_s triple r_ marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , triple r_ yeah , you can user interface : well , that 's another option . industrial designer : that 's also short , catchy . marketing : it 's okay . project manager : yeah , triple r_ . user interface : okay , so which ones are we going to scratch definitely ? marketing : the banana . banana . project manager : banana remote . industrial designer : banana . user interface : i say this one as well . marketing : yeah , the deluxe . project manager : i think we 're all in agreement about the triple r_ . industrial designer : . project manager : i think triple r_ is cool . user interface : triple r_ ? marketing : the r triple r_ . project manager : and it looks cool when you print it in font , looks pretty cool . user interface : triple r_ it is . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : did you do now ? project manager : just like this just and you just print triple r_ , it looks does n't look bad , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it 's short , it 's okay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so have to write my report now , i guess . um um yeah , so we have everything . we have the product , we have the costs , we have the possibility of everything . marketing : it ca n't work . that will not project manager : okay . i think it 's adjourned . retire to my lair and finish the report . that was a short meeting . but efficient though . industrial designer : mm-hmm . the boss is always the last one to go home . so project manager : probably . see . okay , user interface : project manager : goodbye . marketing : okay . industrial designer : see you in a minute . marketing : damn . i will write that one in a word uh document . industrial designer : okay . project manager : could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ? user interface : yeah , sure . marketing : industrial designer : ca n't we take this one ? otherwise we have to do it all over again . marketing : um user interface : i do n't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no . industrial designer : is it okay if i try ? is that okay with you ? user interface : sure . marketing : yeah , okay , i will ask you when uh i need the information . industrial designer : i 'll put it back in a minute . marketing : so it 's oh . industrial designer : okay
