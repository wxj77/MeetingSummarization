    "answer": "kirsty williams am : thank you once again for that . the smooth operation of the hubs , with regard to health and safety , is , of course , of paramount importance . what we have seen since schools closed for traditional statutory purposes and moving to their repurposed function\u2014we have seen a change of pattern over time . so , following my announcement on , i believe , 18 march , the week after , we saw a large number of settings open and operating . as local authorities have been able to understand the demand for those places\u2014from critical workers and vulnerable children\u2014we have seen more local authorities move to a hub model , and we have been able to publish guidance to local authorities on how issues around safe working in those hubs should be followed , and we 've been able to give guidance in that regard . local authorities are asked by us to report any incidents where they are concerned about operation issues on the ground . sian gwenllian am : as i mentioned earlier , testing is crucially important in dealing with this crisis . so , how many school staff have been tested for covid because they may have experienced symptoms and so on ? and how many of those have tested positive ? kirsty williams am : my understanding from public health wales is that 15 teachers have been tested for covid-19 , and i believe two of those results have come back as positive . can i make it absolutely clear , the week before last , welsh government issued new guidance around who should be tested ? i want to make it absolutely clear to those professionals working in our hubs , if they or a member of their family are exhibiting any of the symptoms , however mild , of covid-19 , they can and they should be tested . sian gwenllian am : okay . and the final question from me on this : how important is testing going to be in this next phase , as you start to think about relaxing restrictions ?"
