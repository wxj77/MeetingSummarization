    "query": "<s> according to dr. blaney , what are the reasons for the drop in eu students applying to study in wales ?",
    "answer": "llyr gruffydd am : well , that 's straight into what i was going to ask , really , about what you think the factors are that led to this 8 per cent or 9 per cent drop in eu students applying to study in wales , where we see a 2 per cent increase in england . is that it , or are there other things that you 've taken into account ? what 's your assessment of the reasons behind this ? dr david blaney : it 's very difficult to be definitive about the reasons , but i think there are probably two . the one that bethan has already indicated , which is the change in student support arrangements for eu students , will have an effect of perturbation . that 's probably relatively temporary\u2014let 's hope it is\u2014as that settles down because , actually , the deal for eu students coming into wales is no worse than that coming into england . ours would be better because the fee level is slightly lower , but we do struggle in wales in terms of the anglocentric nature of the media and so on . so , getting the messages out is a challenge . the other dimension is that when you 're in a highly competitive recruitment market , you have to do what you can to look attractive . part of that is about being able to invest in facilities , and particularly buildings and kit , and the relative levels of investment between wales and england over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that . certainly , anecdotally i know , from my own family , that a lot of the choices have been made in terms of the state of repair of campuses and so on . there 's something rational about that , is n't there ? if you 've got a system that is relatively better invested , then you 're likely to have a better student experience because the resources are likely to be better . so , that 's not irrational . we saw a sort of similar but opposite effect when the \u00a39,000 fee maximum limit came in , and some institutions , mostly in england\u2014there was one in wales\u2014chose to pitch their fee levels really quite low , relative to that \u00a39,000 , and caught a cold in the student recruitment market because fee levels denote quality in the student mind . so , the price sensitivities work quite differently . so , again , if you 've got a relatively better invested part of the system , then that might well be one of the reasons why it looks more attractive . llyr gruffydd am : that latter factor would affect the whole of the cohort , not just the international recruitment , of course . dr david blaney : indeed . yes , indeed . the implementation of the diamond recommendations is crucial to that because that 's re-balancing where the policy of investment goes ."
