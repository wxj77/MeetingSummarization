    "query": "<s> what did meilyr rowlands think of the shortage of teachers ?",
    "answer": "meilyr rowlands : obviously , the most important resource for the education system is the teachers . so , it is a concern that recruitment is getting more and more difficult and that targets for initial teacher training are not being hit . and we 're not seeing them hit , if i remember correctly , even in primary , let alone secondary . so , there is a challenge , and i think we 've got to look at this in the round . we 've got to make sure that we have both a long-term strategy and a shorter term strategy for this . so , long term , we 've got to make sure that education is an attractive option for young people and more mature people to want to go into . so , that is partly to do with workload and staff well-being . i think there 's a general acceptance now that that needs to be higher up on the agenda , that people need to take that seriously , and there 's work going on regarding the workload issue . suzy davies am : i suppose what i 'm coming to , and i will finish with this , chair , is , we 're asking our existing workforce to undertake a fair bit of continuous professional development\u2014let 's call it that\u2014in order to get ready for this curriculum when they 've barely got time for lunch as it is . do you think that 's going to have an impact on the ability of secondary schools to get to grips with this , albeit that there 'll be a phasing in ? meilyr rowlands : yes . i think it will have an effect , but i think it 'll have a positive effect . i think the new curriculum , one of the things about the new curriculum is that it re-professionalises the profession . it gives back agency and ownership to teachers . i think it 's really important . and one of the reasons why teaching maybe has n't been that attractive a profession is that teachers in the past have just been delivering a set curriculum , and now they 've got a much more creative part in deciding for themselves how to teach something and what to teach . so , i think that is a very important part of attracting intelligent people into the profession . there are short-term things we need to do , of course , as well . i think we need to have a much more varied set of routes into teaching , so i welcome some of the part-time open university courses , for example . so , there are lots of ways\u2014we were talking about maybe converting people from primary into secondary , particularly in welsh-medium , where there 's a shortage . so , all those kinds of varied routes , i think , into teaching , are important as well . suzy davies am : degree apprenticeships , potentially . meilyr rowlands : yes , i think it 's well worth exploring that . yes . suzy davies am : lovely . thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : okay . si\u00e2n gwenllian now has some questions on secondary schools causing concern . si\u00e2n . sian gwenllian am : yes . just before going on to that , just to pick up on that last point that you made about the shortage of teachers and losing teachers during the first year of their training . has estyn done any themed work on that particular issue , or do you intend to do anything on that ? also , looking at the financial incentives and how they compare with the situation in england , for example ; do we need , perhaps , to think about financial incentives , not just for specific subjects , but for going to schools where there are particular issues , perhaps ?"
