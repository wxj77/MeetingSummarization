project manager : marketing : industrial designer : okay it 's your turn to marketing : okay , okay . so i think my favourite animal would be a c a cat . that 's its head . project manager : user interface : marketing : um i probably like cats the most because they 're cuddly and furry and uh playful . project manager : user interface : marketing : okay . user interface : i dunno if i should go with this . industrial designer : oh it 's okay . project manager : marketing : thanks . user interface : if it is enough line . industrial designer : marketing : maybe put it up user interface : i 'm sorry . marketing : put it a maybe put it on the desk or something . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : industrial designer : i should get used to the tool , so . marketing : user interface : okay . industrial designer : oh just wait a little bit . c could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ?

so , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . anything . industrial designer : okay . marketing : well , from experience , um i 've had remote controls in the past that have had very they 've had lots and lots of buttons and they 've been very small , and it 's been very hard to to to use , because there 's so many buttons , and you know it 's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a tv remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . um . so it 's frustrated me in the past , th that . industrial designer : okay , i have also some points uh . maybe two points . uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it 's it 's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it 's in the day it does n't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . so something like this . and the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but i prefer like a potential-meter or something like . marketing : ah , okay . okay . industrial designer : you know , some slider or project manager : okay . industrial designer : not just two discrete buttons for volume , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : okay , n industrial designer : but something which project manager : mm-hmm . yeah . marketing : is that because the of the discrete volume levels , or is that industrial designer : yeah , but i can reach in uh one second i can mute it down , or or make a high volume . project manager : are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly marketing : yeah . industrial designer : ah , n . project manager : and it can industrial designer : if it drops to the floor then it starts to scream . project manager : yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and industrial designer : yeah , f it depends what what you feel about that . project manager : you have a heart attack . okay . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more notes on that . project manager : yeah so you can user interface : uh i yeah , project manager : do you have something ? user interface : just a simple experience . i uh i prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune . project manager : yeah , that 's true . yeah without obstacles and . industrial designer : okay . project manager : okay . let 's continue . i have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry . marketing : okay . project manager : um . so we will close uh this meeting . industrial designer : okay , just a second . project manager : so we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes . industrial designer : project manager : um . uh . the so i will ask you to do some work . uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and industrial designer : which i which is hamed , ?
