    "answer": "mr. taylor bachrach : mr . chair , i am wondering how the prime minister could explain to a bus driver in vancouver who has been laid off that as a public sector worker , she ca n't access the federal wage subsidy , while an equivalent worker in the airline industry gets to keep her job with the federal help of that program . could the prime minister explain how that is fair ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , i 'm happy to explain to the member and to all canadians that our constitution creates federal areas of jurisdiction and provincial areas of jurisdiction . the airline industry , like banking , like telecommunications , is a federal area of jurisdiction that we have been able to move forward on . more than that , we brought the canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy to all industries across this country , because we knew that as the federal government , it was something that we needed to step up on"
