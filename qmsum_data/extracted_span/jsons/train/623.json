    "answer": "project manager : okay . now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . so i 'm gon na guess that we 've all used remote controls . any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? user interface : well , one thing i 'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there 's there 's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen lcd remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um i mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it 's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the tv to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the v_c_r_ and get it to play once it 's rewound , for instance . project manager : okay . user interface : um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . and therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . project manager : okay , yeah , tha that 's true , with the price range we 're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our user interface : absolutely prohibitive , project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : but you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . user interface : yeah , i mean i would n't like to say you g i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros . project manager : would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the tv , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of user interface : for instance , um let 's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the d_v_d_ player and it turns the tv on and onto the right channel as well , um project manager : okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . um any takes on this ?"
