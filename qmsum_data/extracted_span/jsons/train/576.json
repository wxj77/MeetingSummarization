    "query": "<s> what did kirsty williams am react in response to help students with emotional and mental health difficulties ?",
    "answer": "dawn bowden am : thank you . just two more questions . one is around emotional and mental health difficulties being experienced by children and young people at the moment . now , there was a very welcome announcement of \u00a31.25 million pounds for school counselling . how is that , in practical terms , being applied if those children are not actually in school ? kirsty williams am : you 're right , dawn : we have to consider how we can support children not only in their learning during this time , but also to recognise the very real impact that the pandemic will have on all of our mental health and well-being\u2014recognising , of course , it is absolutely natural for all of us , including children and young people , to have fears and anxieties at this time . that 's a natural reaction to the situation that we find ourselves in . but , of course , there are issues around those children that would have currently been receiving school counselling , and also being able to be in a position to respond to a potential growth in the number of children that are receiving support . so , the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families . in the immediacy , of course , that will have to be done in different ways than perhaps we 've traditionally delivered services in the past , because of social distancing and lockdown rules , but we want to get some of these systems in place now , rather than waiting for everything to go back to normal . we need to be able to plan to offer services in the here and now , but also be able to plan for what potentially could be an increase in the demand of those services . so , we 've been in close touch with local authorities , asking them what they believe that they will need and how they can use additional financial resources , and we 've been very pleased to be able to secure that for them . dawn bowden am : so , that would include things like telephone and video support as well , i guess , then ."
