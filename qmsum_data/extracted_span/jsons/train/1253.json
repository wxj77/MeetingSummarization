    "answer": "user interface : i is there a matter for a new remote control ? project manager : yeah if it 's trendy , original i d fulfil the user needs . user interface : is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ? project manager : we have to discuss that point . on user interface : this is not defined at all ? project manager : yeah you you can suggest points like this . so what what user interface : ah , okay . project manager : so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . so what 's what are your ideas about that ? user interface : project manager : maybe i can have the your opinion from the marketing side ? user interface : well uh do we sell other stuff ? uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . project manager : okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device . user interface : yeah . project manager : do you agree ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . so maybe it should be for multiple devices . and uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ? industrial designer : i think we should n't have too many b for my part . i think user interface : no , i couldn i can not fi think of any requirements right now . industrial designer : if we do n't have so many buttons could be nice . project manager : few buttons . okay . user interface : project manager : and do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? might be a good idea . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . and do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain , what it should n't it should look like , or things like that ? industrial designer : something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box . project manager : with rou okay . like for okay . user interface : something like that , least fits in your hand . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : the basic requirement . project manager : so . fit in your hand , yeah . user interface : only a buck . project manager : and also it have , i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh to , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall . user interface : industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : waterproof . project manager : water-proof as well . industrial designer : and i think we should have a device project manager : maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others ca n't . user interface : marketing : project manager : maybe water-proof would be very original . industrial designer : sorry . marketing : project manager : havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath . that could be uh user interface : b it seems uh so , but uh if you do n't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f project manager : yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very user interface : and , and that 's one of the that 's one of the shock i mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it 's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . project manager : yeah , mayb b user interface : that 's people they actually do it themselves . project manager : but maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . industrial designer : yeah . directly . user interface : i it will look a bulky in that case . project manager : yeah . maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : that might be good uh track to follow . user interface : like as an optional thing . project manager : optional or selled with it ? industrial designer : and i i think we should have something , most of the time i i lose my remote control . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : we should have s uh special bu button on the tv to make the remote control beeping . project manager : maybe we can have uh but we do n't design the tv . marketing : project manager : maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . industrial designer : ah yeah . marketing : user interface : barks . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah , barks , yeah . industrial designer : barks . project manager : so we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ? industrial designer : yeah . yeah whistle . project manager : i do n't know , whistle-able ? th industrial designer : whistle tracking . project manager : whistle tracking yeah . whistle tracking remote control . that 's a good idea , that 's very original and that 's can uh improve . user interface : that 's that 's quite cool , but uh of course we you do n't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ? project manager : yeah d d uh . user interface : so i it 's just going to add t to the cost ."
