    "query": "<s> what did the team agree about kinetic battery when talking about the components concept of industrial design ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : okay so uh the first thing uh i have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : we also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . now project manager : uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . but if we use battery industrial designer : yeah b uh f well uh i meant uh by by battery i meant uh i will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh i did n't fou we did n't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . so uh it 's a point to discuss . then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . but uh well it 's not a a re uh well a real issue for the from the technical uh point of view . concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . and uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . so what i have f found is that i think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because i think solar energy wi wo n't work in a cluttered uh uh environment . so um so i think we can start with these two main things . for the case uh well uh i think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it 's trendy and it 's uh it 's uh well it 's modern and uh user are are are mm will be uh very happy to have a a a nice remote . for the interface uh i think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are uh well cheaper . and s so uh we can move to the next slide . user interface : sorry . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : what is this single curved what does it mean ? industrial designer : well uh uh i i it 's uh it 's the the shape of the um of the remote . user interface : so it 's it 's not industrial designer : you you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the user interface : yo l yeah . when you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold . industrial designer : yeah . it 's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it 's completely flat . user interface : okay . yeah . and the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it does n't matter ? industrial designer : yeah the um that 's the point . the kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um user interface : that that 's what it means by kinetic . industrial designer : yeah and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy . user interface : okay . mm-hmm . okay . industrial designer : but i d i do n't know it 's if it is feasible because i do n't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy . user interface : mm . mm . okay . yeah . yeah . we we might check with our r_ and d_ department to see if they have this product ready for market . industrial designer : yeah . and yeah and so can you go to the next slide please . so and uh that 's uh that summarize well what i have said . user interface : mm mm . wha industrial designer : so uh you 're right we can uh see in our uh r_ and d_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . user interface : ah the department . mm . industrial designer : that 's it . user interface : uh so i um keep in touch with the r_ and d_ department . industrial designer : oh yeah user interface :"
