    "answer": "project manager : hi kate . okay , carry on . industrial designer : just just carry on . project manager : alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . um our agenda should be um that we 're opening the meeting , i have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . um and we should each have a presentation to make . um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . it 's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , um which i 'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . okay . um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we 'll come back to them in a minute after i take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . right um as we remember , i opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting 's minutes were reviewed and approved . um sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . and then steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . i think all of us agreed with those things . kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half pence cost . um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . um and the new requirements that it for be for tv only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . um the corporate image . so we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the tv , but it still should meet those parameters . um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . um at that point we agreed that sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . um and steph was gon na look at ec ergonomics . kate was gon na look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . and i was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : okay . right . so we 're ready to close that and go back to our that one . right . we 're up to the point of the go back . um the three presentations . so we 're going to pull the plug on me and turn to sarah . is that okay ? is that alright with everybody else ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : especially since kate asked to be last . sarah , i 'm sorry if i misspelled your name , i did n't know whether it was s_a_r_a_ or s_a_r_h_ . marketing : i respond to either . project manager : you respond to whatever you get , huh ? marketing : no worries . project manager : okay . um , did you do your hit user interface : yeah , project manager : ah , there it is . ta-da . marketing : okay , first thing i want to address is um one of the points that florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that stephanie uh showed us and and they 're uh twenty to sixty euros , depending on uh branding . user interface : right . marketing : some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . but i think that with the current um price that we 're searching for , we 're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . project manager : mm 'kay . marketing : but i 'm going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things . so , i investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my uh the theme of what i was to work on was uh trend watch . user interface : marketing : and project manager : 'kay . user interface : industrial designer : sorry . user interface : marketing : project manager : user interface : industrial designer : i 'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on . marketing : project manager : marketing : i know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research , industrial designer : marketing : so you know , i 'm just gon na try to cloak it in really professional terms here . what 's hot , fruit and veg . spongy . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : and this is all over the catwalks , paris , milan , and i 'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . industrial designer : marketing : this is really interesting change from past years , user interface : marketing : because it is much more organic , um some would say approachable . and i think if we 're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . so . i also did a little research on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . fancy . functional is out . and f the fancy , and that 's exactly the term , i 'm i 'm thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . this is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . this is interesting , 'cause i think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what 's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . ease of use . again , pretty low , i mean it 's the top three , but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . so i think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves . user interface : industrial designer : i think that 's a good idea . do n't you ? marketing : y yeah , you know project manager : it sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone . marketing : exactly . exactly . i was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . they could be ini initially i thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we 'd just need to get reductionist on it . user interface : marketing : they could be interchangeable , they 're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . so what we 're talking about is changing . this concept . everyone has a tv remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . user interface : marketing : that 's what 's hot on the catwalks . so , this is my this is what i 'm thinking . user interface : project manager : uh-huh mm . in most families , do n't is n't the remote is a remote . marketing : y yeah , but i think i think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , i 'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . user interface : so when your dad 's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we 're gon na watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we 're gon na watch this . marketing : yeah . w and plus i think project manager : mm . well actually some households do have three and four tvs marketing : uh yeah . project manager : and they would have a remote for each one , marketing : yeah . yeah . so this is an idea and i i you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . so i really open this up to uh any other feedback . this spongy fruit and veg . industrial designer : yeah , i i think we 're gon na have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . marketing : thanks . alright . industrial designer : spongy is gon na be difficult , i 'm afraid . user interface : yep . and as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we 're gon na have lots of different interchangeable components . project manager : hmm . marketing : i i just have my ear to the market , guys . user interface : is this to the market ? industrial designer : yeah , i mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . i suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , marketing : is spongiest , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that would add industrial designer : i was thinking titanium myself . user interface : i was thinking titanium , i was thinking it 's just i have been influenced by pictures of ipods , and they 're also minimalist and shiny . marketing : mm-hmm . they are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . i think many of us would associate those with fancy . something else we could do is uh call it something that 's fruit and veg oriented . we could call it uh the name . project manager : are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ? marketing : well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . so project manager : perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management user interface : yeah , but it 's kind of pointless , is n't it ? project manager : and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product . user interface : yeah . marketing : that , you know , that might be user interface : let 's delegate . project manager : wo would that be agreeable ? marketing : and then we could keep it titanium . industrial designer : yeah . w w would it be helpful if um i described the components a bit , because i think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do . user interface : yeah , maybe . or project manager : do you wan na be next or you want kate to go next ? user interface : i think possibly it might be more useful if kate went next . project manager : okay , we 'll move the user interface : um industrial designer : user interface : you can even have them in different flavours as well . so that if you just wan na sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , marketing : yeah . or s or smelly . scratchy user interface : yeah . scratch and sniff . marketing : uh well i was really thinking a lot about the i_ uh the imac kind of gel gem tone . industrial designer : right , well marketing : it 's hot on the streets , guys . industrial designer : i i i think some of this um user interface : industrial designer : you 're gon na be a little disappointed with some of the things i have to tell you , but i 'm afraid this is the real world . so um i 've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and i 've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what 's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they 've got , but i 'm not sure that it 's quite what you want um . now this is n't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . i really need a pen or something but uh does my mouse work ? no . um oh yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ? right . this is this is the a a a remote that 's been opened up and that 's the the back of the interface . and this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they 're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . um and we that 's the basic construction that we 've got to got to accommodate . we got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver . so um i wan i wan na go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made , sarah , but um doing my presentation in the order i wrote it . so first of all um i wan na talk about what possibilities we 've got for the energy source . marketing : industrial designer : um we can have your bog standard double double a_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . we can have a hand sorry user interface : a wind-up . marketing : industrial designer : a wind-up , yeah , which i think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , marketing : project manager : industrial designer : but i it maybe is does n't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . marketing : project manager : alright . industrial designer : um one that one that i think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , marketing : project manager : remember , we only have forty minutes industrial designer : where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . you have to it means that if it 's sitting there for a long time it probably wo n't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , it 'll work . user interface : industrial designer : or we we had talked about solar power , but i thing that we agreed that that 's not so good in the dark . now i 'm afraid this is the options we 've got on on the case . it can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium . marketing : hmm . user interface : industrial designer : um and the nearest we 've got to st to spongy there i guess is rubber , but um i 'm gon na come back to the advantages of titanium , and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but i think if we wan na use standard components , we 're gon na have difficulty with anything much beyond that . okay , what does the interface look like ? um well push button , that 's that 's the one we 're all familiar with . um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something . um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it 's it the technology is there . and we can also incorporate an lcd display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we 've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . if we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . all the other fancy interface designs go out the window , i 'm afraid . um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . if you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that 's what you need if you want the lcd display . and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . now i do n't know what that is , but i think they think it 's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , i have to say , but maybe you think that 's old technology . and well i i think we 've got two options . we can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , i think it , um wo n't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um that may or may not be a good thing . marketing : user interface : industrial designer : sorry . um but it could have an lcd screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company 's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . so , thank you . marketing : that sounds good . any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . industrial designer : yeah , marketing : um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty ? industrial designer : i 'm afraid i do n't have that information available . um manufacturing did n't actually give attach any prices to any of this , i 'm afraid . marketing : hmm . because , you know what , i 'm being quite serious when i say that that um the things i mentioned are hot . but i think the important thing might be to choose one . industrial designer : yeah mm-hmm . marketing : you know , if if what you 're telling me is is um some of these things are n't just f are n't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , blackberry . user interface : bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , marketing : that 's uh user interface : so what i had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . industrial designer : banana ? marketing : alright , well let 's see then . user interface : but um i i do n't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the real reaction company . marketing : yeah . user interface : it 's just what i 'd understood we 'd be doing . that 's before i heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise . marketing : yeah . but yeah , industrial designer : we we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , marketing : i 'm trying to streamline mine a little bit . industrial designer : which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately i see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we ca n't do anything fancier . user interface : shall we wait 'til i 've 'til i 've showed you what well , my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . mm . thank you , kate . project manager : thank you , kate . user interface : you did seem to include just in more detail what i 've got though . so so mine 's a bit pointless . right . industrial designer : user interface : f_n_ and f_ eight , did you say ? project manager : yes . there we go . industrial designer : user interface : i do n't have it on mine though . marketing : oh i think um florence resolved it by industrial designer : i if you do f_ uh f_n_ f_ eight again , it 's it 'll project manager : do it again . marketing : f_ eight again . project manager : keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one , industrial designer : i think it yeah , you you will do an project manager : and then you get it with both . user interface : should i do it again ? project manager : yeah . marketing : maybe . industrial designer : project manager : this time it should come up both . user interface : right then . i do n't actually have a huge amount of different information then what kate says , project manager : okay . user interface : just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including m_p_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . project manager : mm-hmm . mm . user interface : uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . uh i 've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel , which well , i could n't find a the picture of the ipod w only linked to a web browser , so i could n't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . it has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse . so i was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . like i guess an existing sky or cable one does . like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what 's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it 'll show you what 's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up marketing : user interface : and you can see what 's on the other channels while you 're watching the same channel on the screen . uh but i 'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . so project manager : user interface : what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , i mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , i was thinking , yellow and black , just because that 's the company 's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . and when you 've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , it does n't obscure much of the actual picture you 're watching . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . industrial designer : yeah , i 'd i 'd certainly support that idea . user interface : and uh and i definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . i mean titanium would be great , but i think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . if we 're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then i think titanium 's too futuristic . industrial designer : it 's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we ca n't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . user interface : yeah . whereas a plastic 's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . industrial designer : user interface : uh then industrial designer : and the the having the the the screen on the television screen i think is a good idea , 'cause um otherwise we 're we 're putting up the price not only for putting building the lcd in , but for the electronics as well . user interface : and it 's a little bit pointless as well i think . industrial designer : there is that . user interface : like when when when you 've got when you 've got the screen there , it does n't have to be anything fancy , marketing : it 's a duplication . user interface : just a little menu showing yeah , a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wan na change the settings or the you know , your information about programme that 's on at the moment . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i do n't think that 's to taxing to uh s engineer . um . but as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . and i quite like it , 'cause it 's just smooth and hand-held and it 's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out , so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . up , down , left , right . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? user interface : i i was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a i ca n't quite d uh describe it . you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . yeah , see where the mouse is , industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . and enter in the middle , industrial designer : right . user interface : so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . i 'm getting a bit uh specific here . really we 'd have to use something to show you , industrial designer : yeah . i think i think that 's a g nice clean design , user interface : but industrial designer : it 's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology . marketing : to uh m make it . user interface : if i do n't think i can get it up on the screen . ah here we go . right . marketing : oh nice . user interface : well , marketing : um hmm . user interface : the ipod spinning wheel is uh really complicated . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : it does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . what else have we got ? marketing : mm . wow . user interface : them , they 're terrible . but they all have this this feature of this uh it 's not quite a scroll wheel , but it 's a kind of selection in this circle , project manager : it 's a selection wheel . user interface : which i think is a really good idea . industrial designer : but we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper . user interface : yeah , like up , down , left and right . which is good . and then and then yeah , so i mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it 's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . project manager : okay . user interface : so all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . project manager : okay . user interface : and that 's it . industrial designer : in fact user interface : look at look at this one . industrial designer : oh that 's really nice . user interface : almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . project manager : marketing : do you think with um project manager : user interface : might take up your whole living room . marketing : it seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child 's remote . do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? and have it abstract . you know , user interface : possibly . marketing : we could call like a fruit name , user interface : yeah . marketing : but it would be a little more abstract . industrial designer : mm . we we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you 'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy user interface : that also is possible . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : just marketing : i 'm just just throwing out ideas . project manager : or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow . marketing : yeah . i 'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : uh just something else i need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? this is actually the volume up and down , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : but they both say v_ on them , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but it 's actually the v_ to indicate that it 's the volume , so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : nice . good point . user interface : but we would n't have a specific volume up and down . if we 're having the scroll wheel , then it 's gon na double up as all the other up and down functions . project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : but then , that 's complicated . project manager : i wan na thank you all for all your presentations . we have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . um and i think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . so let 's mm . right . they want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which the choices that we 've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . um this is where kate 's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be a little bit guided by kate at this point . industrial designer : project manager : the you were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you 'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . um or solar that you 'd have difficulty with it if it 's a dark day , that it 'll die on you , and no way to do it . that 's the day you wan na use the tv . um so what 's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? industrial designer : oh unfortunately i do n't have costing information . project manager : okay . industrial designer : i i in terms of workability , i i think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , project manager : mm 'kay . industrial designer : but i 'm sorry i do n't figures on the difference in cost . project manager : what 's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ? marketing : i 've used kinetic in terms of watches and it 's very very uh handy , you do n't even notice um that it 's there . user interface : it sounds great . i 've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . sounds like it could be g a really good economical marketing : it 's user interface : it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . marketing : mm-hmm . it could tie in with the fanciful design user interface : yeah . marketing : as uh , you know , user interface : 'cause it 's really a quite attractive thought , marketing : throw the banana , you know , just got ta keep it moving . user interface : is n't it ? it 's like yeah , project manager : so the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it 's at all possible . user interface : a good selling point . but it does depend how much i mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . project manager : it costs . mm . industrial designer : and and how much you do have to keep it moving , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : 'cause i 'm conscious that watching tv can be quite a sed sedentary activity . marketing : yeah . mm-hmm . but i could market that as a um as a a i was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . user interface : do your exercises while you 're watching the tv . industrial designer : yeah . true , yeah , m more more environmentally friendly . user interface : yeah , that 's what i was thinking as well . marketing : mm-hmm . you know , project manager : yeah . marketing : kind of the project manager : thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . industrial designer : oh right , okay , project manager : um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . industrial designer : i 'd that that 's something i maybe should have covered . um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and i would certainly recommend it , i think , because i 'm not sure i have an alternative . project manager : okay . user interface : project manager : what about the ca industrial designer : i i it it 's just the way that the the the uh th the way it 's ac it 's actually built project manager : yeah . oh , the way we uh-huh . industrial designer : and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper . project manager : oh , okay . um what about the case ? i think they 're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , industrial designer : project manager : and i think we 've discussed not having titanium . one , it 's too expensive , um and second , it wo n't do this double um curves . um we 've sort of eliminated wood . we said plastic or rubber . what 's the pleasure ? industrial designer : well if if sarah 's keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we 're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , so it 's marketing : that 's exactly what i was thinking . i 'm sold . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : what about you ? user interface : do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy yeah , s thick spongy cover , marketing : mm . kind of like an internal egg . project manager : cover . user interface : so it feels like the whole thing 's spongy , but actually you 're not damaging anything by squeezing it . project manager : plastic inside . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : because i mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac industrial designer : i 'd i 'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that 's actually possible , but i agree , it 's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is . user interface : yeah . well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wan na stroke them and squeeze them , industrial designer : marketing : and with sports on television . project manager : okay . user interface : and marketing : you know . project manager : um the next part they want is the user interface concept . industrial designer : i should i should r project manager : i 'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to finish with . marketing : then i 'll just say i support either from a marketing point of view i support either decision that the designers make on that . project manager : okay , and it says interface . what type and what supplements ? user interface : just copy the one on the left . no um a scroll well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . industrial designer : which i think technically is just push button and uh i 'd certainly support that that user interface : yeah , industrial designer : that brings the cost down quite a lot user interface : i 'd like push buttons with industrial designer : and it 's something that we 're an ex the company 's an expert on . user interface : so push buttons project manager : okay , um that 's that . um this is gon na sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . whew . industrial designer : project manager : and they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as i can . marketing they want product evaluation . user interface : no , it 's still it 's still plugged in on mine actually . marketing : no we ca n't , actually . project manager : oh . oh my , i 'm sorry . marketing : that 's why i was looking over your shoulder project manager : oh , okay . sorry about that . missed that one . this ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . ah , ta-da . industrial designer : user interface : now it 's gone again . industrial designer : you know , i think the the company 's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately . project manager : yes , because i ca n't even see mine . next meeting starts in thirty minutes , user interface : oh yes . project manager : these are the individual actions . yeah , right . um the look and feel design is for kate , uh steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation . um the two of you get to play with a pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . user interface : great . project manager : uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . marketing : sounds good . project manager : anything else we need to do ? user interface : i do n't think so . project manager : go to it . user interface : play-doh . project manager : and that 's the end of this meeting . that 's for her benefit . marketing : that 's really all i got , guys ."
