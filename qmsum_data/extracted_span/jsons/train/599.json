    "answer": "phd f : how about you , barry ? grad a : um , still working on my my quals preparation stuff . um , so i 'm i 'm thinking about , um , starting some , uh , cheating experiments to , uh , determine the , um the relative effectiveness of , um , some intermediate categories that i want to classify . so , for example , um , if i know where voicing occurs and everything , um , i would do a phone um , phone recognition experiment , um , somehow putting in the the , uh the perfect knowledge that i have about voicing . so , um , in particular i was thinking , um , in in the hybrid framework , just taking those lna files , and , um , setting to zero those probabilities that , um that these phones are not voicing . so say , like , i know this particular segment is voicing , um , i would say , uh , go into the corresponding lna file and zonk out the the posteriors for , um , those phonemes that , um , are not voiced , phd f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : and then see what kinds of improvements i get . and so this would be a useful thing , um , to know in terms of , like , which which , um which of these categories are are good for , um , speech recognition . phd f : hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : so , that 's i hope to get those , uh those experiments done by by the time quals come come around in july . phd f : so do you just take the probabilities of the other ones and spread them out evenly among the the remaining ones ? grad a : yeah . i i i was thinking ok , so just set to set to some really low number , the the non - voiced , um , phones . phd f : mm - hmm . grad a : right ? and then renormalize . right . yeah . phd d : mm - hmm . phd f : cool . that will be really interesting to see , you know . so then you 're gon na feed the those into some standard recognizer . grad a : mm - hmm . phd f : uh , wh are you gon na do digits grad a : yeah , m um , well , i 'm gon na f work with timit phd f : or ? with timit . ok . grad a : timit uh , phone recognition with timit . phd f : mm - hmm . grad a : and , um phd f : oh , so then you 'll feed those sorry . so where do the outputs of the net go into if you 're doing phone recognition ? grad a : oh . um , the outputs of the net go into the standard , h um , icsi hybrid , um , recognizer . so maybe , um , chronos phd f : an - and you 're gon na the you 're gon na do phone recognition with that ? grad a : or phone recognition . right , right . phd f : ok , ok . i see . grad a : so . and , uh , another thing would be to extend this to , uh , digits or something where i can look at whole words . phd f : mm - hmm . grad a : and i would be able to see , uh , not just , like , phoneme events , but , um , inter - phoneme events . so , like , this is from a stop to to a vo a vocalic phd f : mm - hmm . grad a : segment . you know , so something that is transitional in nature . phd f : right . grad a : yeah . phd f : cool . great . grad a : so that 's that 's it . phd f : uh ok . grad a : yeah . phd f : um let 's see , i have n't done a whole lot on anything related to this this week . i 've been focusing mainly on meeting recorder stuff . so , um , i guess i 'll just pass it on to dave . grad g : uh , ok . well , in my lunch talk last week i i said i 'd tried phase normalization and gotten garbage results using that l um , long - term mean subtraction approach . it turned out there was a bug in my matlab code . so i tried it again , um , and , um , the results were were better . i got intelligible speech back . but they still were n't as good as just subtracting the magnitude the log magnitude means . and also i 've been talking to , um , andreas and thilo about the , um , smartkom language model and about coming up with a good model for , um , far mike use of the smartkom system . so i 'm gon na be working on , um , implementing this mean subtraction approach in the far - mike system for the smartkom system , i mean . and , um , one of the experiments we 're gon na do is , um , we 're gon na , um , train the a broadcast news net , which is because that 's what we 've been using so far , and , um , adapt it on some other data . um , an - andreas wants to use , um , data that resembles read speech , like these digit readings , because he feels that the smartkom system interaction is not gon na be exactly conversational ."
