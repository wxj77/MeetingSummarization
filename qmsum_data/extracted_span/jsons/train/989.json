    "answer": "phd a : so is this a histogram across different frequency bins ? professor b : and phd a : or ? professor b : um , i think this i you know , i do n't remember that . do you remember ? phd d : i think they have , yeah , different histograms . i uh something like one per frequency band , professor b : one phd a : so , one histogram per frequency bin . professor b : one per critical phd d : or but i did yeah , i guess . phd a : and that 's phd d : but i should read the paper . i just went through the poster quickly , professor b : yeah . and i do n't remember whether it was filter bank things phd d : and i did n't professor b : or whether it was fft bins or phd a : and and that that , um , histogram represents the different energy levels that have been seen at that frequency ? professor b : i do n't remember that . and how often they you 've seen them . yeah . phd a : uh - huh . professor b : yeah . and they do they said that they could do it for the test so you do n't have to change the training . you just do a measurement over the training . and then , uh , for testing , uh , you can do it for one per utterance . even relatively short utterances . and they claim it it works pretty well . phd a : so they , uh is the idea that you you run a test utterance through some histogram generation thing and then you compare the histograms and that tells you what to do to the utterance to make it more like ? professor b : i guess in pri yeah . in principle ."
