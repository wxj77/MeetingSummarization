    "answer": "grad d : let 's get started . the uh should i go first , with the uh , um , data . can i have the remote control . thank you . ok . so . on friday we had our wizard test data test and um these are some of the results . this was the introduction . i actually uh , even though liz was uh kind enough to offer to be the first subject , i sort of felt that she knew too much , so i asked uh litonya . just on the spur of the moment , and she was uh kind enough to uh serve as the first subject . professor b : mm - hmm . grad d : so , this is what she saw as part of as uh for instr introduction , this is what she had to read aloud . uh , that was really difficult for her and uh grad c : because of l all the names , you mean ? grad d : the names and um this was the uh first three tasks she had to to master after she called the system , and um then of course the system broke down , and those were the l uh uh i should say the system was supposed to break down and then um these were the remaining three tasks that she was going to solve , with a human um . there are here are uh the results . mmm . and i will not we will skip the reading now . d um . and um . the reading was five minutes , exactly . and now comes the this is the phone - in phase of grad c : wait , can i i have a question . so . so there 's no system , right ? like , there was a wizard for both uh both parts , is this right ? grad d : yeah . it was bo it both times the same person . one time , pretending to be a system , one time , to pretending to be a human , which is actually not pretending . grad c : ok . and she did n't grad d : i should grad c : i mean . well . is n't this kind of obvious when it says `` ok now you 're talking to a human `` and then the human has the same voice ? grad d : no no no . we u wait . ok , good question , but uh you you just wait and see . it 's you 're gon na l learn . and um the wizard sometimes will not be audible , because she was actually they there was some uh lapse in the um wireless , we have to move her closer . grad a : is she mispronouncing `` anlage `` ? is it `` anlaga `` or `` anlunga `` grad d : they 're mispronouncing everything , but it 's this is the system breaking down , actually . `` did i call europe ? `` so , this is it . well , if we we um professor b : so , are are you trying to record this meeting ? grad d : there was a strange reflex . i have a headache . i 'm really sort of out of it . ok , the uh lessons learned . the reading needs to be shorter . five minutes is just too long . um , that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here , they 're gon na not they 're subjects are probably not gon na going to follow the order . and uh she did not . grad c : really ? grad d : she no . grad c : oh , it 's surprising . grad d : she she jumped around quite a bit . professor b : s so if you just number them `` one `` , `` two `` , `` three `` it 's grad d : yeah , and make it sort of clear in the uh professor b : ok . right . grad d : um . we need to so that 's one thing . and we need a better introduction for the wizard . that is something that fey actually thought of a in the last second that sh the system should introduce itself , when it 's called . professor b : mm - hmm . true . grad d : and um , um , another suggestion , by liz , was that we uh , through subjects , switch the tasks . so when when they have task - one with the computer , the next person should have task - one with a human , and so forth . professor b : mm - hmm . grad d : so we get nice um data for that . um , we have to refine the tasks more and more , which of course we have n't done at all , so far , in order to avoid this rephrasing , so where , even though w we do n't tell the person `` ask blah - blah - blah - blah - blah `` they still try , or at least litonya tried to um repeat as much of that text as possible . grad c : say exactly what 's on there ? yeah . grad d : and uh my suggestion is of course we we keep the wizard , because i think she did a wonderful job , professor b : great . grad d : in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not asked for , `` how much is a t a bus ticket and a transfer `` so this is gon na happen all the time , we d you can never be sure . professor b : mm - hmm . grad d : um . johno pointed out that uh we have maybe a grammatical gender problem there with wizard . so um . grad a : i was n't was n't sure whether wizard was the correct term for uh `` not a man `` . grad c : there 's no female equivalent of grad d : but uh grad a : are you sure ? grad c : no , i do n't know . professor b : right . grad c : not that i know of . grad d : well , there is witch and warlock , grad a : yeah , that 's so @ @ . professor b : right . grad c : yeah , that 's what i was thinking , but grad d : and uh professor b : right . uh . grad d : ok . and um so , some some work needs to be done , but i think we can uh and this , and in case no you had n't seen it , this is what litonya looked at during the uh um while taking the while partaking in the data collection . professor b : ok , great . so first of all , i agree that um we should hire fey , and start paying her . probably pay for the time she 's put in as well . um , do you know exactly how to do that , or is uh lila i mean , you know what exactly do we do to to put her on the payroll in some way ? grad d : i 'm completely clueless , but i 'm willing to learn . professor b : ok . well , you 'll have to . right . so anyway , um so why do n't you uh ask lila and see what she says about you know exactly what we do for someone in th grad d : student - type worker , professor b : well , yeah she 's un she 's not a a student , grad d : or ? professor b : she just graduated but anyway . so i if yeah , i agree , she sounded fine , she a actually was uh , more uh , present and stuff than than she was in conversation , so she did a better job than i would have guessed from just talking to her . grad d : yeah . professor b : so i think that 's great . grad d : this is sort of what i gave her , so this is for example h how to get to the student prison , professor b : yeah . grad d : and i did n't even spell it out here and in some cases i i spelled it out a little bit um more thoroughly , professor b : right . grad d : this is the information on on the low sunken castle , and the amphitheater that never came up , and um , so i if we give her even more um , instruments to work with i think the results are gon na be even better . professor b : oh , yeah , and then of course as she does it she 'll she 'll learn @ @ . so that 's great . um and also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful . and , uh she 's actually she 's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm , so i think this is all just fine in terms of h her learning things she 's gon na need to know uh , to do her career . so , i my guess is she 'll be r r quite happy to take on that job . and , so grad d : yep . yeah she she did n't explicitly state that so . professor b : great . grad d : and um i told her that we gon na um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s look for the potential sources to find people . she also agrees that you know if it 's all just gon na be students the data is gon na be less valuable because of that so . professor b : well , as i say there is this s set of people next door , it 's not hard to grad d : we 're already yeah . professor b : uh grad d : however , we may run into a problem with a reading task there . and um , we 'll see . professor b : yeah . we could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there 's a task , pays ten bucks or something , grad d : mm - hmm . yeah ."
