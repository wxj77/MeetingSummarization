    "query": "<s> what did industrial designer think of the remote control with bluetooth and other new technology when discussing the possibility of applying different technologies ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : uh yeah yeah , i 'll go , sure . right uh , i 'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . well uh what i did was i dissected uh uh current remote controls and um i viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . and uh after that i put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and i 'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . and i 'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why i think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . um right . uh well what i did was uh i i checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . and the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a tv or uh a stereo or something , and those uh have a transmitter that 's also focused on infrared , so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with bluetooth for instance then uh the tv should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that 's that would n't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us . so that 's probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote . well uh as i mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth well it may be possible , but uh i figured it would n't be possible in within our budget , but that 's not for me to decide , but that 's maybe something for marketing to look into . f because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh bluetooth or or radio waves , although marketing : what do you think about uh incorporating bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the tv , connected to the tv ? industrial designer : yeah , actually i have t marketing : so it 's in the wrong product . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , i actually i figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you 'd still have the uh the infrared function . so in in theory you 'd actually just move the problem , marketing : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : but uh what i did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , user interface : marketing : yeah ."
