    "query": "<s> why was the council disagree about wjec 's decision to delay the welsh/english version ?",
    "answer": "darren millar am : i just want to ask about this eight-week delay . so , you \u2019 re telling us , mr ebbsworth , that the wjec has agreed with hodder and illuminate that , in future , even if an english textbook is available for publication , and it \u2019 s already late , you will further delay the availability of that textbook so that it can be published on the same day as the welsh-medium textbook ? mike ebbsworth : we can only work on those books that are in the process of being developed . naturally , if something is late in english , then that timetable would be affected in terms of a decision that will ultimately have to be taken . but that 's the hope : that when new textbooks are produced in english and authored in english , we would look at that eight-week period as a turnaround . darren millar am : i understand the point that you made earlier about the chapter-by-chapter approach , which seems much more equitable . but to suggest that you will delay books that could be available for students and could be available for teachers to be able to access by two months because you have n't got the systems in place to be able to produce them on the same day , seems to be wholly inappropriate . can i ask , also , why on earth it is n't possible to produce welsh-medium textbooks first and then translate them to english on occasions ? mike ebbsworth : we 're entirely open to that and to that sort of model . darren millar am : so , why has that never ever been done ? gareth pierce : well , of course , it would happen with subjects that stem from wales , but i think the problem is that we work with publishers and those publishers and their authors , therefore , tend to work through the medium of english . but , just to be clear , this idea of delaying an english version is something that the welsh government is eager for us to experiment with , but not with textbooks that are already late . they are within the new programme of textbooks that are contained within the grant that you mentioned of \u00a3500,000 . so , in a way , this is an experiment and the welsh government wants to look at this as one way of responding to the complaint that there are different timetables available . darren millar am : so , you 're being forced to do this by the welsh government , rather than\u2014 gareth pierce : well , we 've agreed to do it in discussion with them . darren millar am : so , are you happy with that approach ? gareth pierce : well , as long as the textbook is n't late in the first place , then yes ; it 's worth trying . there is a challenge on the eight weeks , there is a challenge in the publisher sticking to the timetable in terms of the english version first of all , but we are willing to use this as a test bed , and we 're working on two specific textbooks on this . lynne neagle am : i think the committee is struggling with this idea , so what do you understand to be the rationale behind that , then ? is it that both sets of pupils should be equally disadvantaged ? gareth pierce : well , no , in a way , it uses the same principle as we have regarding our use of digital resources . with the digital materials , the intention is that things are available in time and that they 're available in both languages at the same time . so , trying to imitate that with printed text is what we 're trying to do , but not with texts that are already late . so , if these books keep to the timetable , then they will be available in time in both languages , but that the english version has stayed before going out on the shelves . llyr gruffydd am : so , that 's to say that the english version will be completed eight weeks beforehand so that you have eight weeks for translation . mike ebbsworth : well , ultimately , i may have used the wrong words in saying that we 're holding the english back . the english version would still be in the process , just as the welsh version would be , and then they would catch up as they approach the date for publication and printing . there is an element of editing the english as well as the welsh and that would happen in that eight-week period . so , a draft form might be available , and we do ensure that our draft versions are available on our secure website as soon as possible , but then that has to be held up before publication . lynne neagle am : thank you . john ."
