    "answer": "project manager : user interface : how do you wear this thing ? project manager : hmm . mm mm mm . user interface : not too many cables and stuff . project manager : user interface : original . project manager : is recorded ? okay ? okay so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . so i will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff , user interface : project manager : then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . so user interface : uh . just one thing . uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but i have something else to do uh , so got ta have another meeting uh soon , project manager : user interface : so maybe you could hurry up a bit project manager : sorry ? user interface : it 's true . i have another meeting so if you could uh project manager : you have another meeting soon ? user interface : yeah . project manager : so you have to be quick . industrial designer : user interface : yeah , for the lawnmower project . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . project manager : so the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . user interface : project manager : so uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . first it will be the functional design . third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . so the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . and then we will move to f conceptual design where we 'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . industrial designer : project manager : and then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we 've uh made in the second point . so i will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board . user interface : what an original idea . project manager : do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ? user interface : orangutan . project manager : okay that 's good . industrial designer : user interface : industrial designer : no no n project manager : n n user interface : can i give you the project manager : you should user interface : no ? but i do n't have to say anything . when i 'm drawing the orangutan . project manager : if you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh i 'll let you uh comment . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : user interface : it 's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . project manager : okay it 's an abstract drawing . i think it 's nice and original . industrial designer : you should write y the name i think . marketing : user interface : i do n't have a red colour . usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but i do n't have red pen , so project manager : okay . user interface : yes . project manager : you want to draw something christine ? marketing : user interface : marketing : okay uh sorry . you have to imagine a little bit um . project manager : marketing : this project manager : of course your animal is recorded so it 's not lost . marketing : sorry too uh . user interface : yes . i know . project manager : marketing : user interface : industrial designer : marketing : user interface : project manager : is this uh user interface : wha what is this strange beast ? marketing : is it beautiful ? project manager : industrial designer : user interface : is it a monster ? project manager : marketing : do you know ? it 's a cat . user interface : it 's a cat ? industrial designer : marketing : is n't it ? user interface : i thought these things did not exist . project manager : marketing : yes yes industrial designer : me marketing : is it like that . user interface : ah yeah industrial designer : ah yeah . yeah . marketing : is it better ? project manager : ah okay it 's pretty . marketing : okay . project manager : okay it 's your cat . marketing : it 's my cat . user interface : does have a name ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : the name is caramel . user interface : caramel . ah-ha . industrial designer : caramel . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . olivier , do you want to industrial designer : and you i think i 'm too short for the cables . marketing : project manager : okay i go , but next time you 'll do something i 'm sure . i 'm a bit short on cable . user interface : next time i concentrate . industrial designer : project manager : okay . so what could i draw ? maybe i can draw like a very simplified cow . i do n't know if it looks like a cow user interface : he looks like a bong . marketing : industrial designer : project manager : like a what ? user interface : okay . sorry . no . industrial designer : quite squarey . user interface : scary ? project manager : industrial designer : he also . marketing : project manager : i dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact i would say . user interface : marketing : user interface : i i think we will be finished this uh project manager : okay so i hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control . user interface : is it for uh for putting a for logos , no . project manager : okay . user interface : that 's project manager : let 's move on . so here the uh financial objective of our project . that is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million euros . user interface : i is there a matter for a new remote control ? project manager : yeah if it 's trendy , original i d fulfil the user needs . user interface : is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ? project manager : we have to discuss that point . on user interface : this is not defined at all ? project manager : yeah you you can suggest points like this . so what what user interface : ah , okay . project manager : so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . so what 's what are your ideas about that ? user interface : project manager : maybe i can have the your opinion from the marketing side ? user interface : well uh do we sell other stuff ? uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . project manager : okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device . user interface : yeah . project manager : do you agree ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . so maybe it should be for multiple devices . and uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ? industrial designer : i think we should n't have too many b for my part . i think user interface : no , i couldn i can not fi think of any requirements right now . industrial designer : if we do n't have so many buttons could be nice . project manager : few buttons . okay . user interface : project manager : and do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? might be a good idea . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . and do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain , what it should n't it should look like , or things like that ? industrial designer : something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box . project manager : with rou okay . like for okay . user interface : something like that , least fits in your hand . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : the basic requirement . project manager : so . fit in your hand , yeah . user interface : only a buck . project manager : and also it have , i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh to , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall . user interface : industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : waterproof . project manager : water-proof as well . industrial designer : and i think we should have a device project manager : maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others ca n't . user interface : marketing : project manager : maybe water-proof would be very original . industrial designer : sorry . marketing : project manager : havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath . that could be uh user interface : b it seems uh so , but uh if you do n't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f project manager : yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very user interface : and , and that 's one of the that 's one of the shock i mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it 's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . project manager : yeah , mayb b user interface : that 's people they actually do it themselves . project manager : but maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . industrial designer : yeah . directly . user interface : i it will look a bulky in that case . project manager : yeah . maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : that might be good uh track to follow . user interface : like as an optional thing . project manager : optional or selled with it ? industrial designer : and i i think we should have something , most of the time i i lose my remote control . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : we should have s uh special bu button on the tv to make the remote control beeping . project manager : maybe we can have uh but we do n't design the tv . marketing : project manager : maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . industrial designer : ah yeah . marketing : user interface : barks . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah , barks , yeah . industrial designer : barks . project manager : so we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ? industrial designer : yeah . yeah whistle . project manager : i do n't know , whistle-able ? th industrial designer : whistle tracking . project manager : whistle tracking yeah . whistle tracking remote control . that 's a good idea , that 's very original and that 's can uh improve . user interface : that 's that 's quite cool , but uh of course we you do n't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ? project manager : yeah d d uh . user interface : so i it 's just going to add t to the cost . project manager : yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors . i think this is a good advantage . user interface : it 's cool . i think i like the idea , but i 'm not sure about the what you , project manager : yeah . we have to ask user interface : who is giving who 's giving who 's giving our budget . who 's project manager : yeah . we have to ask the quest of that 's uh design to the uh industrial um designer . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah project manager : which is you . user interface : 'kay . project manager : okay so try to find that for next meeting . industrial designer : okay . project manager : okay . so next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh . do n't pani . industrial designer : do n't panic . project manager : so so i will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : so then i will ask the user interf interface designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : and also um i will ask the market expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . so . and then uh i will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . so . thank you i think that 's all for this point . user interface : good . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : marketing : thank you user interface : uh , so we come back in five minutes ? half an hour . project manager : anyway you will receive some messages . be careful . you eat it ? does it move uh ? okay , but i do n't know if it uh is still correctly uh we 'll see ."
