    "query": "<s> what did project manager think of the scroll wheel suggested by user interface ?",
    "answer": "user interface : yep . um okay , so , i think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . so if we can have a higher priced uh remote control i think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing . um mm there 's the lcd screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but i think also at the scroll wheel , i have n't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an lcd screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . i think even that , project manager : user interface : i mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an lcd screen , to implement , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : um but i think that would be quite useful as well . and the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but i think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there 's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology , and maybe we wan na make it something that 's extensible to do other tasks . say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . you know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it does n't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you also , selling the potential of the device . then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , i dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , i think that 's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we 're putting the fashion in electronics . project manager : okay . okay . okay , thanks . you want to go ? industrial designer : yep . so yeah . so most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own i project manager : this one ? industrial designer : yeah , it should be . project manager : great . no , not that one . you are two . alright . industrial designer : okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . so he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote . so the old kind of users who do n't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our marketing expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing . project manager : okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel . industrial designer : that 's right . so anyway , that did n't come into my mind , project manager : okay . industrial designer : so th that is a possibility . these could be other kind of interfaces . project manager : industrial designer : means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . so spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . so if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five euros money which we are thinking . otherwise we are just like others in the market . so anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which can not be done now actually . so apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . and for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote . project manager : yeah . that increases the the cost also . industrial designer : uh that 's right . but uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that . project manager : do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ? industrial designer : uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it 's enough . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc project manager : well wh uh i imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control . industrial designer : that 's right . no it it could be little d yeah it could be project manager : so it could be s a few centimetres . user interface : well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though , industrial designer : that 's right . that 's right . user interface : because , i 'm not sure exactly where we 're gon na sell this , but i presume it 's not gon na just be english speaking countries . project manager : yeah . user interface : so then you have to s you know , you have to train models for industrial designer : mm-hmm mm-hmm . uh it 's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so d_t_w_ could be kind of which is the easiest . so you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and it 's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide . industrial designer : yeah , that 's right . yeah . project manager : this is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion . industrial designer : so we can that 's right . yep . project manager : okay , next . uh that finished ? industrial designer : no no . components . project manager : components ? industrial designer : yeah . so , will you go to the next slide ? project manager : yes sure . user interface : industrial designer : yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . we are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , user interface : industrial designer : and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . and then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time . user interface : industrial designer : so we could not put that . so now where the a_s_r_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . so there is a_s_r_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . and then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so this is the easiest design the there could be . so th an a_s_r_ decoder we can have things in . to have different technologies . so this was the my personal preference was that we can have a_s_r_ sitting there on the remote control . project manager : user interface : you know i guess you could actually train the remote control as you 're using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button industrial designer : yeah . user interface : like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing industrial designer : yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so these are the slight problems . project manager : so your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ? industrial designer : because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though i do n't have much idea , but as he the uh marketing expert presentation was marketing : i 'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo everyone will s will buy it . user interface : actually i 'm not so sure industrial designer : so if we go with just the user interface : because i 'm the marketing : i 'm sure . user interface : you know if i was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because i ca n't hear it very well , i do n't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when i 'm when i 'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control . you know if there 's some there 's some dialogue all of a sudden that i ca n't hear , i 'm trying to actually find out what 's being said , project manager : yeah . user interface : so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps . project manager : okay so marketing : yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it 's about user interface : well it depends if it 's a remote control th marketing : it 's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that . user interface : maybe if the remote control is something that y you do n't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion . marketing : user interface : if you can leave it sitting on the table and you do n't actually have to find it , then that could be . industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now . industrial designer : alright . project manager : um so if i if i kind of summarise everything we 've de we we said . we are targeting tv . we need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . um we have marketing : with a good shape for the"
