    "answer": "project manager : okay , back to this meeting . um we 're down to the prototype presentation . industrial designer : ta-da . user interface : alright . project manager : over to you . industrial designer : right . user interface : well . project manager : ooh , two . user interface : yeah , well you see , each made one , we did n't have enough yellow dough . industrial designer : user interface : this is the one that i made . project manager : uh-huh . user interface : it is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . this is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus . of course we need someone who 's experienced with the television . i mean this is the infrared thing that 's gon na zap at the television . uh i 'm not quite sure how to make that , but i 'm sure it will work . uh this is on off switch , 'cause i think we do need that , and i think it gives it a nice balance . project manager : 'kay . user interface : and it 's gon na have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . project manager : okay . user interface : um as for what it 's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus . project manager : okay . user interface : uh position , i presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . the main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . right ? form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold . uh material , i think kate 's gon na tackle that quite a bit , but i think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it 's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . project manager : user interface : also with on off switch and infrared uh i had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . so like uh well , i dunno , what 's it like ? i guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . whereas otherwise we 'd thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gon na see what you thought , the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . so we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . and what we well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . uh material yeah , that 's what i have to say about material . can i scroll down on there and see what else industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : well colour , i think i definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that 's the company colours , but if anybody 's got any other suggestions , i 'm quite willing to consider them as well . so , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if i 'm yeah , maybe , kate , you better say what you think about them . industrial designer : um well i do n't have very much to add . um the the case oops , that 's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . user interface : industrial designer : the the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . we 're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . we have the technology to do that . um and as for the the actual components um , uh steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . we have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it 's the stalk of the banana , or it 's just the thing at the end of this version . um so that 's for material . colour , well uh steph 's the expert on colour . um we we do n't have any particular restrictions on that . yeah , i think that 's all we 've got to say really . user interface : i thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , i guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . industrial designer : a banana . user interface : this one has n banana , yeah . this one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it 's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it 's more like yeah , you 'd expect it to be like a child 's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which i quite like that sort of image . 'cause it 's very big and chunky and child-friendly and industrial designer : would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? user interface : hold them , you see , you know . curvature , is it to your liking ? project manager : oh i see , the on-off 's in the back . industrial designer : yes , that 's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . user interface : if you do n't wan na tire out your thumbs after all . project manager : and then you can use your thumb . industrial designer : and it was partly we thought the design looked better , user interface : yeah . project manager : i could see this thing , unless it 's reinforced , having a problem with the you know user interface : breaking , project manager : yeah . user interface : oh right . well you see , that 's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it 'd just be rigid . marketing : i like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . user interface : yeah , we really like we really like that design , marketing : it 's really kind of a user interface : i mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . like a c like a compass point , you know , marketing : mm-hmm mm-hmm . user interface : just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . and it 's like the the ipod scroll wheel , but better . marketing : yeah . but it 's also like texting , user interface : yeah . yeah , yeah , marketing : you do n't user interface : i mean it that 's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , marketing : industrial designer : user interface : i was try i was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? industrial designer : and it 's a very simple design , marketing : yeah . user interface : it 's texting . industrial designer : there 's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make . marketing : it 's also in terms of um being lost it 's it 's quite it looks quite different . you know , i i d i have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to user interface : yeah . marketing : you know , this is really identifiable . user interface : i mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of i mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gon na appear at the bottom of the screen , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : but we do definitely think that it 's a viable option . project manager : okay . the next item is evaluation . marketing : no , okay . project manager : uh if that 's if you 're finished ."
