    "answer": "grad g : what if you preload them all ? grad e : right ? i mean , so so we could use like x waves instead of transcriber , postdoc a : yeah . grad e : and it loads faster , certainly . grad g : what if you were to preload all the channels or or initially grad e : well that 's what i tried originally . grad g : like does n't grad e : so i i actually before , uh , dave gelbart did this , i did an interface which showed each waveform and ea a ribbon for each waveform , grad g : mm - hmm . grad e : but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll . so you just scroll a screen and it would , you know go `` kur - chunk ! `` grad g : oh , ok . postdoc a : mm - hmm . grad e : and so it just was not doable with the current interface . postdoc a : you know , i am thinking if we have a meeting with only four speakers and , you know , you could fire up a transcriber interface for , y you know , in different windows , multiple ones , one for each channel . and it 's sort of a a hack but i mean it would be one way of seeing the visual form . grad e : i think that if we decide that we need that they need to see the visuals , we need to change the interface so that they can do that . postdoc a : yeah . yeah . professor c : so phd d : that 's actually what i thought of , loading the chopped up waveforms , i mean , you know , that that would make it faster grad e : an but is n't the chopped up waveforms ."
