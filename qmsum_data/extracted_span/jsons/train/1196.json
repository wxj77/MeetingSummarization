    "answer": "professor b : ok so uh today we 're looking at a number of uh things we 're trying and uh fortunately for listeners to this uh we lost some of it 's visual but um got tables in front of us . um what is what does combo mean ? phd c : so combo is um a system where we have these features that go through a network and then this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in the msg features . and so these low - pass filtered goes through m eh another mlp and then the linear output of these two mlp 's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this klt . um the output is used as uh features as well . professor b : um so let me try to restate this and see if i have it right . there is uh there is the features uh there 's the ogi features and then um those features um go through a contextual uh l l let 's take this bottom arr one pointed to by the bottom arrow . um those features go through a contextualized klt . then these features also uh get um low - pass filtered phd c : yeah . yeah so yeah i could perhaps draw this on the blackboard professor b : sure . yeah . yeah . phd c : yeah . phd d : the graph , yeah another one . professor b : yeah , that 's good . phd c : so we have these features from ogi that goes through the three paths . professor b : yeah . three , ok . phd c : the first is a klt using several frames of the features . professor b : yeah . yeah . phd c : the second path is uh mlp also using nine frames several frames of features professor b : yeah . uh - huh . phd c : the third path is this low - pass filter . professor b : uh - huh . phd c : uh , mlp professor b : aha ! aha ! phd c : adding the outputs just like in the second propose the the proposal from for the first evaluation . professor b : yeah ? yeah . yeah . phd c : and then the klt and then the two together again . professor b : no , the klt . and those two together . that 's it . phd d : two htk . professor b : ok so that 's that 's this bottom one . phd c : um . so this is yeah professor b : and so uh and then the the the one at the top and i presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they 're the best ? phd c : yeah that 's the reason , yeah . professor b : oh let 's focus on them then so what 's the block diagram for the one above it ? phd c : for the f the f first yellow line you mean ? professor b : yeah . phd c : yeah so it 's uh basically s the same except that we do n't have this uh low - pass filtering so we have only two streams . phd d : step . phd c : well . there 's there 's no low low - pass processing used as additional feature stream . professor b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . do you e um they mentioned made some uh when i was on the phone with sunil they they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers . phd c : yeah . uh actually the way things seems to um well it 's uh forty percent for ti - digit , sixty for all the speechdat - cars , well all these languages . ehm the well match is forty , medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty - five . yeah . professor b : um and we do n't have the ti - digits part yet ? phd c : uh , no . but yeah . generally what you observe with ti - digits is that the result are very close whatever the the system . professor b : ok . and so have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that ? phd c : yeah . professor b : i mean not phd c : uh not yet . professor b : ok so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good phd c : no . mmm yeah , yeah . professor b : then we could compare the two and say what was better . phd c : mmm . yeah . professor b : um and how does this compare to the numbers oh so ogi two is just the top top row ? phd d : yeah . phd c : so yeah to actually ogi two is the the baseline with the ogi features but this is not exactly the result that they have because they 've they 're still made some changes in the features and well but uh actually our results are better than their results . um i do n't know by how much because they did not send us the new results professor b : uh ok so the one one place where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched italian . phd c : yeah . yeah . yeah there is something funny happening here because yeah . professor b : yeah . phd c : but there are thirty - six and then sometimes we are we are we are around forty - two and professor b : now up uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a a second um silence detection . phd c : yeah . so there are some results here phd d : for the italian . phd c : uh so the third and the fifth line of the table phd d : for this one . professor b : so filt is what that is ? phd c : filt , yeah phd d : yeah . phd c : um yeah so it seems f for the the well match and mismatched condition it 's uh it brings something . uh but uh actually apparently there are there 's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay . uh well professor b : oh we ca n't do it . oh ok . phd d : for that for that we professor b : too bad . good idea , but ca n't do it . phd c : yeah . except i do n't know because they i think they are still working well . professor b : uh - huh . phd c : uh t two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector so but yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh some kind of compromise between the delay that 's on the handset and on the server side . perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and but well hmm for the moment they have this large delay on the the feature computation and so we do n't professor b : ok . so alright so for now at least that 's not there you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum does n't have a huge effect but it but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places . uh little bit . phd c : yeah . professor b : um and um um yeah and uh let 's see what else did we have in there ? uh i guess it makes a l um at this point this is i i guess i should probably look at these others a little bit uh and you you yellowed these out uh but uh uh oh i see yeah that that one you ca n't use because of the delay . those look pretty good . um let 's see that one well even the just the the second row does n't look that bad right ? that 's just uh yeah ? and and that looks like an interesting one too . phd d : mmm yeah . phd c : actually the yeah the second line is uh pretty much like the first line in yellow except that we do n't have this klt on the first on the left part of the diagram . we just have the features as they are . professor b : mm - hmm . yeah . yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better . and it 's it 's it 's a little slightly simpler . phd c : mm - hmm . yeah . professor b : so so there 's so i i would put that one also as a as a maybe . uh and it yeah and it 's actually does does significantly better on the uh uh highly mismatched italian , so s and little worse on the mis on the mm case , but uh well yeah it 's worse than a few things phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : so uh let 's see how that c that c c see how that comes out on their their measure and are are we running this uh for ti - digits or uh phd c : yeah . professor b : now is ti di is is that part of the result that they get for the uh development th the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of end of the month , the ti - digits are there also ? phd c : yeah . yeah . it 's included , yeah . professor b : oh ok . ok . and see what else there is here . um oh i see the one i was looking down here at the the o the row below the lower yellowed one . uh that 's uh that 's with the reduced uh klt size reduced dimensionality . phd c : mm - hmm ? yeah . yeah . professor b : what happens there is it 's around the same and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps . phd c : yeah , it 's it 's significantly worse well but mm - hmm . professor b : it 's significantly worse it 's it 's uh it 's it 's mostly worse . phd c : exc - except for the hm phd d : for many a mismatch it 's worse . professor b : yeah . but it is little . i mean not not by a huge amount , i do n't know . what are what are the sizes of any of these sets , i i 'm i 'm sure you told me before , but i 've forgotten . so you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ? phd d : i do n't remember . professor b : about ? phd c : um it 's it depends well the well matched is generally larger than the other sets and i think it 's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps , at least . phd d : ye but words well word i do n't know . phd c : hmm ? the words , yeah . s sentences . phd d : sentences . phd c : some sets have five hundred sentences , so . phd d : yeah . professor b : so the so the sets so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences , let 's say and each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it most of them longer or phd c : yeah . phd d : yeah for the italian even seven digits y more or less phd c : it it d seven digits . phd d : but sometime the sentence have only one digit and sometime uh like uh the number of uh credit cards , something like that . professor b : mm - hmm . right , so between one and sixteen . see the i mean the reason i 'm asking is is is we have all these small differences and i do n't know how seriously to take them , right ? phd c : mm - hmm ? professor b : so uh i if if you had uh just you know to give an example , if you had uh um if you had a thousand words then uh a a tenth of a percent would just be one word , phd c : yeah . professor b : right ? so so it would n't mean anything . phd d : yeah . phd c : yeah . professor b : um so um yeah it be kind of i 'd kind of like to know what the sizes of these test sets were actually . phd c : yeah . phd d : the size that we have ? phd c : we could we could run run some kind of significance tests professor b : yeah since these well also just to know the numbers , phd d : yeah . professor b : right . so these these are word error rates phd c : yeah . professor b : so this is on how many words . phd d : yeah we have the result that the output of the htk professor b : yeah . phd d : the number of of sentences , no it 's the number is n't . phd c : yeah sure sure . yeah sure . professor b : yeah so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then then that that be great . phd c : yeah . phd d : yeah . professor b : um what else is there here ? um see the second second from the bottom it says sil , but this is some different kind of silence or thing or what was that ? phd d : it the the output silence of the mlp . phd c : oh yeah i see . phd d : it 's only one small experiment to know what happened . to apply also to in include also the the silence of the mlp we have the fifty - six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those . professor b : yes . uh - huh , uh - huh . the silence plus the klt output ? oh so you 're only using the silence . phd c : yeah . phd d : yeah , because when we apply the klt phd c : no they 're i think there is this silence in addition to the um klt outputs phd d : in addition , yes . phd c : it is because we we we just keep uh we do n't keep all the dimensions after the klt phd d : in addition t phd c : and yeah . phd d : and we not s we are not sure if we pick we have the silence . phd c : so we try to add the silence also in addition to the these twenty - eight dimensions . professor b : i see . ok . and what and what 's ogi forty - five ? the bottom one there ? phd c : uh it 's o it 's ogi two , it 's so the th it 's the features from the first line phd d : it 's in fact ogi two . phd c : and yeah . professor b : right , but i mean what 's the what does the last row mean ? phd c : so it 's uh basically this but without the klt on the from the left path . professor b : i thought that was the one i thought that was the second row . so what 's the difference between the second phd c : uh the second line you do n't have this combo stuff so you just professor b : so this is like the second line but with with the combo stuff . phd c : yeah . yeah . phd d : and with the all the output of the combo . professor b : ok . yeah . phd c : yeah . professor b : ok , so alright so it looks to me i guess the same given that we have to take the filt ones out of the the running because of this delay problem so it looks to me like the ones you said i agree are are the ones to look at phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : but i just would add the the the second row one phd c : yeah . professor b : and then um if we can um oh yeah also when when they 're using this weighting scheme of forty , thirty - five , twenty - five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors ? i guess it 's probably on the percentages right ? phd c : uh i guess , yeah . professor b : yeah ok . phd c : i guess , yeah . mmm . professor b : alright . phd c : it 's not clear here . professor b : ok . maybe maybe they 'll argue about it . um ok so if we can know what how many words are in each and then um dave uh dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they 've gotten friday phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : and then we 'll operate with that phd c : yeah . professor b : and uh how long did it i guess if we 're not doing all these things if we 're only doing um um i guess since this is development data it 's legitimate to do more than one , right ? i mean ordinarily if in final test data you do n't want to do several and and take the best phd c : yeah . mmm . professor b : that 's that 's that 's not proper but if this is development data we could still look at a couple . phd c : yeah . we can yeah . sure . but we have to decide i mean we have to fix the system on this d on this data , to choose the best professor b : yeah . i right . phd c : and these professor b : but the question is when when do we fix the system , phd c : but we could professor b : do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on tuesday ? i yeah , ok except that we do have to write it up . phd c : i think we fixed on tuesday , yeah . yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : also , so phd c : yeah . yeah . uh yeah well . well basically it 's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some some other @ @ . professor b : right so maybe what we do is we we we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth phd c : yeah but mm - hmm . professor b : but we start the write - up right away because as you say there there 's only minor differences between these . phd c : i think you we could we could start soon , yeah . professor b : yeah . phd c : write up something . professor b : yeah , and and i i would you know , i would i 'd kind of like to see it phd c : um yeah . mm - hmm . professor b : maybe i can i can edit it a bit uh sure . the my what in this si i in this situation is my forte which is english . phd c : yeah . professor b : uh h yeah . have y have you seen alt d do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ? phd c : uh not really . um there is the format of the table which is quite impressive . professor b : yeah ? uh i see . yes , for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it 's not really that impressive , it 's just tiny . it 's all these little categories set a , set b , set c , multi - condition , clean . uh no mitigation . wow . do you know what no what no mitigation means here ? phd c : um it should be the the problem with the error channel error professor b : oh that 's probably the this is probably channel error stuff phd c : well , you professor b : huh ? oh this is i right , it says right above here channel channel error resilience , phd c : yeah . yeah . professor b : yeah . so recognition performance is just the top part , actually . uh and they have yes , split between seen databases and non - seen so basically between development and and evaluation . phd c : yeah . professor b : and so right , it 's presumed there 's all sorts of tuning that 's gone on on the see what they call seen databases and there wo n't be tuning for the uh unseen . multi - condition multi - condition . so they have looks like they have uh uh phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : so they splitting up between the ti - digits and everything else , i see . so the everything else is the speechdat - car , that 's the multi multilingual phd c : yeah , so it 's not divided between languages you mean or professor b : well , it is . phd c : it just professor b : it is , but there 's also there 's these tables over here for the for the ti - digits and these tables over here for the car data which is which is i guess all the multilingual stuff phd c : oh yeah . professor b : and then uh there 's they also split up between multi - condition and clean only . phd c : yeah . for ti - digits . yeah , actually yeah . for the ti - digits they want to train on clean and on noisy professor b : yeah . phd c : and yeah . professor b : so we 're doing that also , i guess . phd c : uh yeah . but uh we actually do we have the features ? yeah . for the clean ti - digits but we did not test it yet . uh the clean training stuff . professor b : well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh next few days phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : i guess they have to send it out let 's see the thirty - first is uh uh wednesday and i think the it has to be there by some hour uh european time on wednesday phd c : hmm - hmm . professor b : so i think basically phd d : we lost time uh wednesday maybe because that the difference in the time may be is a long different of the time . professor b : e excuse me ? phd d : maybe the thursday the twelfth of the night of the thurs - thirty - one is is not valid in europe . phd c : yeah . phd d : we do n't know is happening . professor b : yes , so i mean i think we have to actually get it done tuesday phd d : tuesday . professor b : right because i i think phd c : yeah , well . except if if it 's the thirty - one at midnight or i do n't know we can still do some work on wednesday morning . professor b : yeah well . w i is but is is it midni i thought it was actually something like five pm on phd c : yeah , well . yeah . phd d : yeah . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : was like i thought it was five pm or something , i did n't think it was midnight . i thought they said they wanted everything by phd d : yeah , five pm . professor b : well , so five pm their time is is if phd d : not five pm , three pm . professor b : three pm . phd d : three pm . professor b : alright , that 's six in the morning here . phd c : it 's d no . phd d : uh no three three a - three pm ? phd c : no , we are wondering about the the the hour that we have to eh i do n't know if it 's three pm it 's phd d : oh yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . three pm here is in europe midnight . phd c : yeah , it 's it 's midnight but professor b : yes , yes , but i did n't think it was midnight that it was due , i thought it was due at some hour during the day like five pm or something . phd d : oh ok . mm - hmm . mm - hmm , professor b : in which case phd d : maybe . professor b : so i i uh well we should look but my assumption is that we basically have to be done tuesday . um so then next thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath phd d : yeah . professor b : but then then we 'll actually have the new data which is the german and the danish phd c : yeah . professor b : but that really will be much less work because uh the system will be fixed phd c : yeah . professor b : so all we 'll do is take whatever they have and and uh and run it through the process . phd c : yeah . professor b : uh we wo n't be changing the training on anything phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : so there 'll be no new training , there 'll just be new htk runs , so that 's means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after after tuesday and and uh maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of uh the research . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : um you know what things uh did you think of when you were uh doing this process that uh you just did n't really have time to adequately work on uh uh so phd c : mm - hmm . yeah . professor b : what ? grad a : oh , stephane always has these great ideas and oh , but uh we do n't have time . phd c : sure . professor b : yeah . grad a : yeah . professor b : yeah . phd c : i 'm not sure these are great ideas . professor b : but they 're ideas . yeah ? oh , that was good . phd c : yeah . grad a : yeah . professor b : and and uh also it 's still true that uh i think it 's true that that we we at least got fairly consistent i improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features rather than uh in sequence which was was your suggestion and that that that seems to have been borne out . phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : the fact that none of these are are you know , enormous is is is not too surprising most improvements are n't enormous and uh phd c : yeah . professor b : some of them are but uh i mean you have something really really wrong and you fix it you can get big and really enormous improvements phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : but uh um cuz our best improvements over the years that we 've gotten from finding bugs , but anyway ok well i i think i see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about or or are we done ? phd c : mm - hmm . i think it 's ok um . we so basically we will i think we 'll try to to focus on these three architectures and and perhaps i was thinking also a fourth one with just just a single klt because we did not really test that professor b : uh - huh . phd c : removing all these klt 's and putting one single klt at the end . professor b : yeah , i mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it . phd c : yeah . professor b : uh if you can fit it in . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : oh i have yeah i do have one other piece of information which uh i should tell people outside of this group too uh i do n't know if we 're gon na need it uh but uh jeff up at the uh university of washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh ibm machines rs six thousands phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : and and uh so i think each one is four processors or something or i do n't know , eight hundred megahertz or something and there 's four processors in a box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some kind of ti so if you know he 's got a lot of processing power and um we 'd have to schedule it but if we have some big jobs and we wan na wan na wan na run them he 's he 's offering it . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : so . it 's uh when he was here eh uh he he used i not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as i could tell , so so in some ways he just got his payback , but uh again i i do n't know if we 'll end up with if we 're gon na be cpu limited on anything that we 're doing in this group phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : but but if if we are that 's an offer . ok well uh you guys doing great stuff so that 's that that 's really neat and uh we 'll uh uh g do n't think we need to uh um oh well the other thing i guess that i will say is that uh the digits that we 're gon na record momentarily is starting to get are starting to get into a pretty good size collection and um in addition to the speechdat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now so that 's that 's another source of data . um which is s under somewhat better control and that we can we can make measurements of the room the uh that you know if we feel there 's other measurements we do n't have that we 'd like to have we can make them and uh dave and i were just talking about that a little while ago so uh that 's another another possibility for this this kind of work . phd c : mm - hmm ."
