    "answer": "grad b : um and uh shared with him the ideas about um extending the larry saul work and um i asked him some questions about factorial h m so like later down the line when we 've come up with these these feature detectors , how do we how do we uh you know , uh model the time series that that happens um and and we talked a little bit about factorial h m ms and how um when you 're doing inference or w when you 're doing recognition , there 's like simple viterbi stuff that you can do for for these h m and the uh the great advantages that um a lot of times the factorial h m ms do n't um do n't over - alert the problem there they have a limited number of parameters and they focus directly on on uh the sub - problems at hand so you can imagine um five or so parallel um features um transitioning independently and then at the end you you uh couple these factorial h m ms with uh with uh undirected links um based on based on some more data . so he he seemed he seemed like really interested in in um in this and said said this is this is something very do - able and can learn a lot and um yeah , i 've just been continue reading um about certain things . professor a : mm - hmm . grad b : um thinking of maybe using um um m modulation spectrum stuff to um as features um also in the in the sub - bands professor a : mm - hmm ."
