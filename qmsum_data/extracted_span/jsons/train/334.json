    "answer": "grad c : and so we had a meeting on friday talking about how to avoid that , and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the the subject m to really have intentions and sort of to act upon those , and um there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job because it it 's getting more complicated . so if you know anyone interested in in what i 'm about to describe , tell that person to to write a mail to me or jerry soon , fast . um the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks `` go shopping `` um `` take in uh a batch of art `` um `` visit do some sightseeing `` blah - blah - blah - blah - blah , sort of analogous to what fey has started in in in compiling compiling here and already she has already gone to the trouble of of anchoring it with specific um o { comment } um entities and real world places you will find in heidelberg . and um . so out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple , such as if if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film , the person can then decide `` ok , i wan na do that at this place `` , sort of make up their own itinerary a and and tasks and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h high level category list with them , but uh the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with with symbols for the objects . and so , the person can maybe make a mental note that `` ah yeah i wanted to go shopping here `` and `` i wanted to maybe take a picture of that `` and `` maybe um eat here `` and then goes in and solves the task with the system , ie { comment } fey , and um and we 're gon na try out that any questions ? grad g : so um y you 'll have those say somewhere what their intention was so you still have the the nice thing about having data where you know what the actual intention was ? grad c : mm - hmm . yeah . grad g : but they will um there 's nothing that says you know `` these are the things you want to do `` so they 'll say `` well these are the things i want to do `` and right , so they 'll have a little bit more natural interaction ? grad c : hopefully . grad g : ok . mm - hmm . grad f : so they 'll be given this map , which means that they wo n't have to like ask the system for in for like high level information about where things are ? grad c : yeah it 's a schematic tourist map . so it 'll be uh i it 'll still require the that information and an grad g : it w it does n't have like streets on it that would allow them to figure out their way grad c : n not not not really the street network . nuh . grad e : so you 're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever ? grad c : yeah a and um the map is more a means for them to have the buildings and their names and maybe some ma ma major streets and their names grad g : mm - hmm . grad c : and we want to maybe ask them , if you have get it sort of isolated street the the , whatever , `` river street `` , and they know that they have decided that , yes , that 's where they want to do this kind of action um that they have it with them and they can actually read them or sort of have the label for the object because it 's too hard to memorize all these st strange german names . and then we 're going to have another we 're gon na have w another trial run ie the first with that new setup tomorrow at two and we have a real interesting subject which is ron kay for who those who know him , he 's the founder of ici . so he 'll he 's around seven seventy years old , or something . grad g : i did n't know he was the founder . that 's ok . grad c : and he also approached me and he offered to help um our project and he was more thinking about some high level thinking tasks and i said `` sure we need help you can come in as a subject `` and he said `` ok `` . so that 's what 's gon na happen , tomorrow , data . grad g : using this new new um plan , grad c : new new set up . yeah . which i 'll hopefully sort of scrape together t but , thanks to fey , we already have sort of a nice blueprint and i can work with that . questions ? comments on that ? if not , we can move on . no ? no more questions ? grad e : i 'm not sure i totally understand this grad g : so what 's the s this is what you made , fey ? grad e : but i 'm not sure i totally understand everything that 's being talked about grad g : like so so it 's just based on like the materials you had about heidelberg . grad c : um are you familiar with with the with the very rough setup of the data ? grad e : but i i imagine i 'll c just catch on . undergrad d : based on the web site , yeah , at the grad g : oh ok there 's a web site grad c : experiment ? undergrad d : right . grad g : and then you could like um figure out what the cate undergrad d : it 's a tourist information web site , grad e : uh , this is where they 're supposed to grad c : talk to a machine and it breaks down and then the human comes on . grad e : yeah . yeah . grad c : the question is just sort of how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task . grad e : ok . ok . ok . grad c : because what will happen then is that people repeat repeat , { comment } or as much as they can , of that phrasing . grad g : hmm . um , are you worried about being able to identify um . the the goals that we 've d you guys have been talking about are this these you know identifying which of three modes um their question uh concerns . grad c : mm - hmm . grad g : so it 's like the enter versus view grad c : yeah , we we we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction , grad g : uh - huh . grad c : right ? that 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things grad g : uh - huh . mm - hmm . grad c : and so th the q first question for the subject is , `` so these are things , you know , we thought a tourist can do . is there anything that interests you ? `` grad g : mm - hmm . grad c : and the person can say `` yeah , sure sh this is something i would do . i would go shopping `` . yeah ? and then we can sort of this s instructor can say `` well , uh then you you may want to find out how to get over here grad g : mm - hmm . grad c : because this is where the shopping district is `` . grad g : so the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session ? grad c : no . just sort of ok , what what what would you like to buy and then um ok there you wan na buy a whatever cuckoos clocks grad g : yeah . grad c : ok and the there is a store there . grad e : mm - hmm . grad c : so the task then for that person is t finding out how to get there , right ? grad g : mm - hmm . grad c : that 's sort of what 's left . grad g : mm - hmm . grad c : and we know that the intention is to enter because we know that the person wants to buy a cuckoos clock . grad g : ok , that 's what i mean so like those tasks are all gon na be um unambiguous about which of the three modes . grad c : hopefully . grad g : right . ok . so . phd a : well , so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words . grad c : hopefully . grad g : t that they 'll be here ? grad c : yes . in a sense that 's exactly the the the idea , which is never possible in a in a s in a lab situation , phd a : well , u u the one experiment th that that that i 've read somewhere , it was they u used pictures . so to to uh actually um uh specify the the tasks . grad e : mm - hmm . phd a : uh , but you know i i grad c : yeah . we had exactly that on our list of possible way things so we uh i even made a sort of a silly thing how that could work , how you control you are here you you want to know how to get someplace , and this is the place and it 's a museum and you want to do some and and and there 's a person looking at pictures . so , you know , this is exactly getting someplace with the intention of entering and looking at pictures . phd a : right . grad c : however , not only was the common census were among all participants of friday 's meeting was it 's gon na be very laborious to to make these drawings for each different things , phd a : right . grad c : all the different actions , if at all possible , and also people will get caught up in the pictures . so all of a sudden we 'll get descriptions of pictures in there . phd a : right . grad c : and people talking about pictures and pictorial representations and um phd a : right . grad c : i would s i would still be willing to try it . phd a : i mean , i i 'm i 'm not saying it 's necessary but but uh i uh uh i you might be able to combine you know text uh and and some sort of picture and also uh i think it it will be a good idea to show them the text and kind of chew the task and then take the test away the the the the the text away grad c : mm - hmm . yeah . phd a : so that they are not uh guided by by by what you wrote , grad c : we will phd a : but can come up with their with their own"
