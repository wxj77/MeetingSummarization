    "answer": "user interface : um i do n't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . i mean it might be nice for changing the volume . project manager : it would be nice for changing the volume , industrial designer : oh . user interface : uh but project manager : but i do n't know how useful it 'd be for changing the channel . 'cause you do n't have control over numbers user interface : i do n't think it would really work . marketing : yeah , it 's a project manager : or industrial designer : yeah , user interface : yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel . industrial designer : th it 'd be it 'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . marketing : but if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : we have five minutes left for the meeting , so . marketing : and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as i 'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we 're gon na have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no it 's gon na inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . user interface : yeah . project manager : so , have a scroll for volume ? industrial designer : f or for all those secret functions ? when you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . user interface : i think yeah , i think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it 's not necessary . um industrial designer : right . so we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later . i do n't know . project manager : i think w well i think when we go on to the une userface , we 're gon na have to decide the interface we 're gon na have to decide um whether we 're gon na have a scroll or not ."
