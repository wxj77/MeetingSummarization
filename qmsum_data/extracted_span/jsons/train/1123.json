    "query": "<s> what was emphasized on the more able and talented stream ?",
    "answer": "john griffiths am : mark , did you want to pursue these matters further ? mark reckless am : yes . i just wanted to ask about the more able and talented stream . it was good to read in your report an increased emphasis on this and to see your awareness of its importance in the pdg as well . can i just ask\u2014 ? would you look at one area regarding schools ' engagement with the seren network , particularly for the more able and talented , and what more estyn can do through its inspection criteria and otherwise to encourage this from schools ? meilyr rowlands : well , i think estyn has always been very strongly focused on improving the performance of more able pupils . for example , in last year 's annual report i raised it , and a lot of the debate around this now , i think , was generated by some of the things i 've said in previous annual reports . we gave a lot of evidence to the\u2014 . paul flynn , i think , did the\u2014no , who did the report ? paul murphy did the report . so , we gave evidence to that . and on seren , i 'm particularly proud that my alma mater , jesus college , is a very strong supporter of the seren work . so , i 'm personally quite interested in the work of seren . and we look at the performance of more able pupils in all our inspections . it 's a particular part of our inspection framework\u2014looking at the relative performance of different groups . so , we look at the different performance of boys and girls , free school meals and non-free school meals , ethnic minorities , but we also look at the performance of more able pupils in particular , and we question schools about how they provide for the more able pupils , and we 've referred to seren in several of our inspection reports . mark reckless am : and where schools work particularly hard to engage with seren and take up opportunities from that and push as many pupils as appropriate to work with that , is that something that you would recognise within your inspection reports ? and , on the other side , where schools do n't do that , is that something you would pull them up on ? meilyr rowlands : yes , we 've done that . we 've done it in several reports . claire morgan : throughout our inspections , we are looking for best practice , because part of our strategy is always to identify where there are weaknesses , but actually to point schools in the direction of where they can find a solution . so , capturing different approaches to more able and talented is part of the role of inspection . mark reckless am : thank you . llyr gruffydd am : just briefly , you touched earlier on using the measure of those who are eligible for free school meals as a way to identify children from disadvantaged backgrounds so that you can target this funding . varied evidence has been given to us on this . do you have an opinion on whether that 's the best way ?"
