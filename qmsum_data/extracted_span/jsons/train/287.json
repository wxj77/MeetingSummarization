there are some notes in it already i see , some documents . uh i 'll start with the presentation kick off . is being modified by the administrator . uh okay . user interface : marketing : hmm , that 's interesting . project manager : let 's do it read only . well i do n't know if you 've noticed , but uh we 're working for real reaction . uh it 's a company in uh electronics . we put fashion in electronics , uh we make it work , uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . i 'm bart the project manager so i 'll direct you through the project . this is our agenda . uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . marketing : project manager : uh maybe i can sit down , then i can take some notes or let 's see . maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . marketing : sure . project manager : i dunno it 's not a lot of work , but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . uh as you can see uh it 's the opening , aquaintance tool training . aquaintance is a point we 've done a bit . um have you all seen the corporate website already ? yeah . marketing : yep . visit it . project manager : have you seen any flaws in it ? i think i found one . no ? marketing : ca n't say i paid much attention to it , project manager : i can see if it works this way . no , it does n't work here . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : okay no problem . but um on the corporate information side there 's a th uh there was real remote instead of real reaction . marketing : oh yeah . project manager : real remote is not really the company we 're we are , but it 's just a little fault . user interface : okay . yeah . project manager : um okay , what are we going to do ? uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . it has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . so these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . we 've got the marketing expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look . marketing : okay . project manager : and industrial designer uh there 's also user friendly and a bit original . and we 've got our user interface designer . he 's also uh that 's about the new remote control . uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . first is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . after the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . i had some role indications on here . but i think you know it already by yourself . the industrial designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . uh the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation . so that 's a bit what you 're going to do . but that will be all worked out in uh other meetings . marketing : project manager : then we 've got our first tool training . we are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it 's ab it 's handy if we have a little bit of training first . as you can see we 've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . um in the white board here there 's a little tool bar on this side . here are some functions . you can save . n uh these functions we do n't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing . a blank new document for each person . uh select a pen , eraser . capture we do n't have to do anything with . uh then we 've got our pen . this pen . it 's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of . marketing : 'kay . project manager : you can also select the current colour and the line width . but then first you have to select the pen function . but we 're going to work with it in a minute . so okay . uh that 's very simple and it 's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there . uh then a short thing about documents . we 've got our shared folder , project project what was it ? project documents i think . but all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . and these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wan na show , just open it from the folder . user interface : okay . yeah . project manager : here is a simple tool bar . it 's what i just said , it 's save , print , move back or forward one page . you can switch between the different drawings . and then we 're going to try out the white board . industrial designer : project manager : so as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it . user interface : project manager : mouse was n't running away . marketing : user interface : marketing : that was interesting . project manager : is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ? no . marketing : innocent . project manager : okay . user interface : project manager : we 're going to uh draw animal . and uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . marketing : project manager : um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . marketing : project manager : uh there 's i can start from now . i will . you can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing wo n't get good . user interface : okay . marketing : 'kay . project manager : another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 'cause if you 're going to draw like really fast then um the pen wo n't hold up . so we choose form of current colour uh i think grey is appropriate . then the line width . i think seven will be nice . now you 'll see my drawing capabilities . user interface : project manager : these are not very much , but uh uh , see you have to do it real slow . oh industrial designer : project manager : user interface : marketing : user interface : sure . project manager : ah i was trying to draw a dolphin , user interface : project manager : but i think his nose has to be a little bit marketing : user interface : project manager : but it 's close . marketing : i 'm thinking about a swordfish . project manager : so what yeah it 's this is bit of the swordfish . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : project manager : yeah , he has n't got an eye . user interface : industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : woah . now we 've got another function . we 've got the eraser . marketing : . project manager : and then you can undo this easily . marketing : meat . project manager : ah it 's okay . user interface : project manager : and i 've got to write down a few of its characteristics . uh is they 've got no text tool , no . uh . okay . user interface : marketing : project manager : this is typically a undo action , i think . marketing : yeah . project manager : pen . maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . i think that 's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . but i do n't know , i 'm just trying . this is not my work , industrial designer : marketing : project manager : okay . maybe you have to use oh . marketing : project manager : uh . i think it 's a it wants to draw a another animal ? i do n't know . it lives for the fun . so it 's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . it lives for the fun . so now i 'm gon na hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . user interface : okay . marketing : okay . user interface : project manager : go ahead . marketing : thank you . okay . gon na use a different line width . and i 'm gon na draw in black . there . 'kay , i 'm not much of an artist , but here we go . project manager : maybe it 's easier to draw the smaller line width , i think . because this is going a lot better than uh i did . industrial designer : user interface : a sheep . industrial designer : marketing : okay . user interface : project manager : marketing : this is my um hmm . sheep . project manager : it 's nice . marketing : with of course project manager : uh . marketing : little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts . project manager : it 's a real dead sheep , user interface : marketing : there . project manager : yeah . for recognition , marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , i see . um maybe you can also write your name somewhere . marketing : 'kay . project manager : on just a marketing : they are project manager : marketing : come on . you have to go really slow when you 're writing . project manager : yeah . marketing : they 're brilliant animal animals . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : and that 's just a little me thingy . so . guess i 'll pass the pen to our user interface designer . project manager : nice . user interface : okay . um i 'm just gon na draw its uh head , but mm let 's see . mm . uh . okay . project manager : sweet . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : interesting . user interface : you know what that is ? or who ? industrial designer : garfield . marketing : a rabbit ? user interface : ah okay , yeah . marketing : garfield . yeah . user interface : just a mm . guess . so uh yeah . that 's enough . um , you say a blank , project manager : yeah , just a blank sheet . user interface : or okay . industrial designer : well i was gon na draw a cat too , so . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : i 'll just try something else . project manager : no . industrial designer : something different than garfield . user interface : industrial designer : mine is a bit more skinny . project manager : yeah , it 's pretty skinny cat . user interface : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but uh marketing : and the most interesting tail . project manager : is your cat , or did you find him on the street ? industrial designer : user interface : marketing : industrial designer : well , it 's supposed to be a cat . i like cats because uh they are uh independent . project manager : ah . industrial designer : the pen . so . project manager : okay . that 's pretty clear . so everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? so if you have any ideas or if you wan na draw anything on the white board , just ask marketing : yeah . industrial designer : the pen . project manager : and go ahead . it 's pretty uh easy . marketing : project manager : 'kay . user interface : project manager : s marketing : we 're being haunted . project manager : haunted white board . so we 've got the tool uh introduction . we move along to the project finance . marketing : project manager : um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five euros . our selling price . uh our profit aim is fifty million euros . uh that 's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . um but that 's all in the later stadium . our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half euros , so that 's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we wo n't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . it wo n't work . so just try to remember these points . selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we 're trying to focus on . and production cost uh maximal twelve and a half euros . so that 's leads us to our little discussion . we 've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . so i 'm gon na sit down , i think . it 's easier . marketing : yeah , you got a message . project manager : i 've got a message . five minutes . okay , user interface : five minutes , okay . project manager : that 's uh good timing . marketing : so just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? project manager : uh maybe you have to say the magic word . user interface : marketing : yeah . right . project manager : does it do anything ? maybe you have to just clap it down ? mm back up again . no slide show . hmm . marketing : it 's off now . project manager : it 's off . now you have to put it back o oh yeah . you 'll be okay , i think . marketing : well , it was on , but project manager : well it 's those laptops . marketing : ah , there we are . project manager : nice . okay . but so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and i mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? like you can use for other ? marketing : user interface : mm . oh really ? project manager : you ? user interface : it 's a industrial designer : no , me neither . marketing : well , we have a kind of broad tv at home , and a d_v_d_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the tv , one for the video recorder , one for the d_v_d_ player . project manager : ah yeah . marketing : and i think it 's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . project manager : yep . yeah user interface : sure . yeah . project manager : i 've i 've got one at home . and you can uh program i think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . user interface : okay , yeah . yeah . project manager : and it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . user interface : okay , yeah . project manager : so that 's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d_v_d_ player downstairs and you 've got a link to your tv on the second floor . so that 's a pretty handy um marketing : really . user interface : hmm . oh . mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . project manager : thing . um but only the i think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . it 's uh marketing : yeah . project manager : that 's good to remember . marketing : so i think you can take minutes again . project manager : yeah , that 's nice , i think . marketing : since it 's your job . project manager : so we 've we want different functions marketing : yeah . project manager : uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . but i do n't know if that will exceed the production costs . so that uh that 's something we have to find out , i think . marketing : yeah . but that would be really good if we could do that . project manager : and other functions for a remote control ? maybe we can make it uh uh user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : um . think it has to be shock proof user interface : sure , yeah . marketing : 'cause project manager : shock proof . marketing : my remote control tends to fall a lot . user interface : waterproof , or uh project manager : sure . user interface : uh , you never no know uh , marketing : so user interface : i w i mean uh project manager : waterproof . okay . so these are our um a few things we can think of . um i will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder . user interface : 'kay . marketing : yeah , one other little thing . thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it . project manager : that 's a marketing : so you can see project manager : battery stays . user interface : okay , yeah . marketing : how much is left in the battery . but they 'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we 'll have to see about that too . project manager : yeah . marketing : but maybe just a little led , i do n't know . project manager : that 's an idea as well . other ideas ? quick ideas . industrial designer : nope . they were all mentioned , project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so project manager : any questions about this uh presentation ? kick off presentation . marketing : um . nope , do n't think so . project manager : okay , then i 'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . finish meeting now . okay . marketing : okay . project manager : and we can all work uh on our own projects . marketing : aye sir . project manager : okay then i 'll meet you in about a half an hour , i think . marketing : half an hour . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so good luck . user interface : okay ."
