    "answer": "professor b : well . but like we 're saying , if there 's four or five things like that then pretty sho soon you 're talking real improvement . phd e : yeah . yeah . and it yeah . and then we have to be careful with that also with the neural net professor b : yeah . phd e : because in { comment } the proposal the neural net was also , uh , working on after frame - dropping . professor b : mm - hmm . oh , that 's a real good point . phd e : so . well , we 'll have to be to do the same kind of correction . professor b : it might be hard if it 's at the server side . right ? phd e : mmm . well , we can do the frame - dropping on the server side or we can just be careful at the terminal side to send a couple of more frames before and after , and so . i think it 's ok . phd a : you have , um so when you uh , maybe i do n't quite understand how this works , but , um , could n't you just send all of the frames , but mark the ones that are supposed to be dropped ? cuz you have a bunch more bandwidth . right ? professor b : well , you could . yeah . i mean , it it always seemed to us that it would be kind of nice to in addition to , uh , reducing insertions , actually use up less bandwidth . phd a : yeah . yeah . professor b : but nobody seems to have cared about that in this evaluation . phd a : and that way the net could use if the net 's on the server side then it could use all of the frames ."
