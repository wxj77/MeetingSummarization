'kay that 's we 're not doing so badly . um easy to use oh okay , let 's forget that one . fancy looking . project manager : as he models the user interface : it does n't get much fancier . marketing : sure . and we could do whatever we like with the l_ lcd . yeah let 's just assume it 's a good lcd display . project manager : marketing : maybe i was panicking for no reason . industrial designer : are we going one on ? marketing : yeah , industrial designer : i 'd say we go two , 'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved . project manager : i 'd industrial designer : would n't it ? marketing : w maybe you 'd be a bit too project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . there we go . yeah , industrial designer : with the articulators . with bells on it . marketing : that 's m that 's that 's better too . more accurate numbers . technologically innovative . well , we 're getting rid of the locator thing project manager : which is a shame . marketing : which which user interface : mm . i 'd give it a three for this for that . marketing : yeah industrial designer : no need for teletext . marketing : . user interface : yeah . i mean the menus thing is something you do n't normally see on um on a remote , marketing : 'kay . user interface : but you see it in a lot of other places . marketing : yeah , mobile phones . and y what you 're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control , so it 's user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : you say three ? i might go as far as two on that . three . user interface : i 'd give it a three . project manager : i 'd be tempted with three , yeah . marketing : three . okay . project manager : we 'll get panned on the next one , anyway . marketing : okay . materials that people find pleasing . industrial designer : project manager : yeah , w marketing : sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently . project manager : it is , yeah . do n't blame them . marketing : project manager : um because of the way that we 've minimalised the number of buttons and such . marketing : yeah . project manager : plastic , it sucks . but it 's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have . marketing : that 's true . it 's not a step backwards . industrial designer : five ? user interface : mm-hmm . i 'd s i i 'd give it a six , to be honest . project manager : marketing : yeah , okay let 's give it a six . industrial designer : six , . marketing : okay , that 's totally thrown everything off balance . inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . w we could . what colour were we gon na make it ? industrial designer : put a leopard print on it . user interface : well i i i would sa i would say give a s give a selection of colours . marketing : i know , user interface : um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype marketing : but user interface : 'cause we had yellow . if i were buying one , i 'd go for purple . leopard print would be cool . marketing : but um by this i think it 's more a case of fruit and veg , industrial designer : yeah we got ta . i 'd say the colour of the border there world you 'd find that , that 's that 'd stand out . marketing : yeah . project manager : like yellow , yeah . it would also help keep the the product placement s industrial designer : logo , brand . project manager : yeah . is it inspired by clothing fashion ? marketing : but th th they 're referring to the fruit and veg thing . industrial designer : mm 'kay . project manager : yes . marketing : is this like a banana type colour ? could we stretch no still , it 's not shaped like a banana is user interface : that 's kinda i project manager : it 's kind o it user interface : it wo n't be when it 's been project manager : probably marketing : oh is that 'cause it 's flat ? user interface : budgeted . marketing : what is what fruit or veg is flat ? user interface : i i think s i i think this is n't not particularly fruit and veggie . um . marketing : yeah . or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well . industrial designer : yellow courgette . user interface : project manager : well industrial designer : project manager : i mean it 's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , so , what , four ? marketing : four ? oh that 's it 's very ambitious , project manager : is that being too generous ? user interface : mm . i 'd i 'd i do n't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions . marketing : yeah , um . project manager : oh dear , . marketing : sure . inspired by . user interface : um i 'd g i 'd rate i 'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually . industrial designer : well this this what we 're gon na t this is their motto , like . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and we 're we 're not doing well on it . marketing : this is their strategy . i m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gon na be proportional to the marks . might we might wan na be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one . project manager : what would you think yourself ? marketing : i would say i mean it 's it 's not at all , right ? in any way or shape or form . project manager : well , it 's kind of curved marketing : we did n't m project manager : and we can make it yellow , and that 's pretty much banana like . marketing : okay , the the yellow banana like thing is i think is okay . project manager : si it 's got a curve to it . marketing : right five . is that sound reasonable ? project manager : am i do you think i 'm stretching the uh the use of the banana ? industrial designer : yeah , i 'll go with five . marketing : five . yeah . 'kay , so we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . so five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one . which gives us an average of three . it 's well this would be in the middle . so we it 's it 's not bad . it 's in the good section . project manager : it 's not bad and considering the do n't pick the pen . um . marketing : oops . sorry . i 'm i 'm sorry . industrial designer : project manager : y oh and you 've knocked batteries out . marketing : project manager : um right okay it 's industrial designer : 's bad design , that thing . project manager : considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . project manager : it was gon na be quite hard to get anything standing out i 'd say possibly , based on um the the cost features . industrial designer : mm , yeah . marketing : even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down a grade to to four , we would have to do i mean we did n't we were n't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . you know like we did n't we did n't add we did n't subtract a whole seven points from these things , so i think we 're definitely on the good bit . user interface : marketing : even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that 's still only three extra points over seven . you know , it 's yeah , user interface : mm . personally , i think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control marketing : we did it w it was okay . it was good . user interface : that you 've already got , are people really gon na shell out twenty five euros for something that 's only marginally good ? industrial designer : well , it depends who your who 's what the target people are , like you 'd say maybe the fashion conscious project manager : maybe it 's been targeted industrial designer : women would be going , oh look at that , 's cool , it looks like a marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : it 's yellow , looks like a banana , it 's cool it 's got ta look good in the sitting room . project manager : hide it in the fruit basket . industrial designer : rather than the lcd whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology it 's good , it 's got an lcd screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick . so , which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ? project manager : probably the people technologically . they 're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff . user interface : marketing : i think so . industrial designer : marketing : i mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , and she 's had it for a long time , you know . she uses it to make phone calls and that 's it . industrial designer : . marketing : yeah . so i think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , i mean that 'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , you know . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : she 'd be like is this a remote control , i do n't how do you use it , and stuff like that . so even if it is really user friendly to us , but we 're used to using menus all the time . user interface : mm-hmm . i s i suppose one thing is that b because it 's technically innovative , um for someone who 's sort of technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting . marketing : yeah . yeah . i think it 's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah ."
