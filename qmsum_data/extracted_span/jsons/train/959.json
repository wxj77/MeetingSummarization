    "answer": "mr. luc berthold ( mganticl'rable , cpc ) : thank you very much , mr.chair . i am going to keep talking about the area of jurisdiction that the prime minister likes to talk about , except that i want to point out the incompetence of the liberals in keeping their commitments on infrastructure projects . my question is very simple . as the provinces gradually restart their economies , can the prime minister tell us how many projects that the provinces have submitted are waiting for approval from his government ? mr. luc berthold : mr.chair , i hope that the length of the pause will not be taken out of my time . the chair : no , i stopped the clock for your time . ms.mckenna , you have the floor . hon . catherine mckenna ( minister of infrastructure and communities ) : i 'm sorry , mr.chair , i was on mute . i 'm very pleased with how we are working with the provinces and territories . i have spoken with all of my provincial and territorial counterparts over the last couple of weeks . work on our historic infrastructure program is progressing well . my department has worked very hard to approve projects , and we will continue to do so . it is very important to build projects that will create good jobs the chair : we are returning to mr.berthold . mr. luc berthold : we still have n't had a response . how many projects are currently awaiting government approval ? i know that the minister has been meeting virtually with the provinces over the last few days . however , there are still hundreds of projects waiting for approval from the liberal government . rather than wait for the right political opportunity to approve these files , will the minister commit today to respecting the provinces and approving by next week all the projects that are sitting on her desk ? hon . catherine mckenna : mr.chair , i 'm pleased with how we are working with the provinces and territories . we are approving projects . if the hon . member speaks to the provinces and territories , he will see how well we are working together . we will announce the approval of projects because it 's very important for our economy , our communities and creating good jobs . mr. luc berthold : does the minister understand that she has n't told us how many projects are still pending ? the construction season is very short . approval of a project in july means that work ca n't begin until next year , which wo n't help revive our economy ."
