    "query": "<s> what was the debate about government providing direct financial assistance to people living with disabilities ?",
    "answer": "the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll now go to mr. blaikie , elmwoodtranscona . mr. daniel blaikie ( elmwoodtranscona , ndp ) : thank you very much , mr . chair . twice , following negotiations with the ndp , the government has committed to provide direct financial assistance to people living with disabilities . i 'm wondering when those people can expect the government to announce the details of that assistance . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable minister . hon . ahmed hussen : mr . chair , we are committed to advancing on the issues that have been identified by canadians with disabilities . we are continuing that engagement , and we will have more to say on that very soon . mr. daniel blaikie : i think that answer is entirely inadequate . i have a lot of sympathy for people across the country who are living with disabilities and are getting impatient with the fact that alongside its initial commitment to seniors , for instance , the government made a commitment to helping people living with disabilities with the same kind of direct financial assistance , and it has n't come . why has it taken so long for the government to get around to helping people who are in a crisis right now ? i want to know the reason why this has n't been announced yet . hon . ahmed hussen : mr . chair , we have established the covid-19 disability advisory group , comprising experts in disability inclusion . we 're moving forward with the canada emergency student benefit , which will provide $ 2,000 per month for eligible students with permanent disabilities . we are doubling the canada student grants for students with disabilities in the coming academic year . we have done a lot , but we will continue to do more , and we will have more to share on our continuing efforts to support persons with disabilities . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : go ahead , mr. blaikie . you have time for one short question . mr. daniel blaikie : their commitment was not around an advisory commitment . their commitment was for direct financial assistance to people living with disabilities who are facing additional costs because of the pandemic . they have committed twice and they have done nothing . when are they going to get around to it ? why should people living with disabilities have to wait any longer than they already have ? the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable minister ."
