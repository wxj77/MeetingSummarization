    "answer": "phd b : cuz in two - party conversations , like switchboard , there 's an awful lot too if you just look at backchannels , if you consider those overlaps ? it 's also ver it 's huge . it 's just that people have n't been looking at that because they 've been doing single - channel processing for speech recognition . grad h : mm - hmm . professor d : mm - hmm ? phd b : so , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps do you have of , say the two - person type , by adding more people . to a meeting , and it may be a lot more but i it may it may not be . professor d : well , but see , i find it interesting even if it was n't any more , because since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in switchboard where it was just all separated out we just everything was just nice , phd b : mm - hmm ? professor d : so that so the issue is in in a situation where th that 's phd b : well , it 's not really `` nice `` . it depends what you 're doing . so if you were actually having , uh depends what you 're doing , if right now we 're do we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting . so the question is , you know `` are there really more overlaps happening than there would be in a two - person party `` . professor d : mm - hmm ? phd b : and and there well may be , but professor d : let let m let me rephrase what i 'm saying cuz i do n't think i 'm getting it across . what what i what i should n't use words like `` nice `` because maybe that 's too i too imprecise . but what i mean is that , um in switchboard , despite the many many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap . and what we 're doing now is , aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap and one of the reasons that we 're considering it , you know , one of them not all of them , one of them is that w uh at least , you know i 'm very interested in the scenario in which , uh both people talking are pretty much equally audible , and from a single microphone . and so , in that case , it does get mixed in , and it 's pretty hard to jus to just ignore it , to just do processing on one and not on the other . phd b : i i agree that it 's an issue here but it 's also an issue for switchboard and if you think of meetings being recorded over the telephone , which i think , you know , this whole point of studying meetings is n't just to have people in a room but to also have meetings over different phone lines . professor d : mm - hmm . phd b : maybe far field mike people would n't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply , professor d : mm - hmm . phd b : so if each of us was calling and having a meeting that way you kn you know like a conference call . and , just the question is , y you know , in switchboard you would think that 's the simplest case of a meeting of more than one person , professor d : mm - hmm . phd b : and i 'm wondering how much more overlap of the types that that jane described happen with more people present . so it may be that having three people is very different from having two people or it may not be . professor d : that 's an important question to ask . i think what i 'm all i 'm s really saying is that i do n't think we were considering that in switchboard . phd b : not you , me . but uh but but professor d : were you ? grad h : though it was n't in the design . professor d : were you were you were you were you measuring it ? i mean , w w were phd b : there there 's actually to tell you the truth , the reason why it 's hard to measure is because of so , from the point of view of studying dialogue , i mean , which dan jurafsky and andreas and i had some projects on , you want to know the sequence of turns . professor d : yeah . phd b : so what happens is if you 're talking and i have a backchannel in the middle of your turn , and then you keep going what it looks like in a dialogue model is your turn and then my backchannel , professor d : yeah . phd b : even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn . professor d : yeah ? phd b : so , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling it 's we know that that 's wrong in real time . professor d : yeah ? phd b : but , because of the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in switchboard were missing , people could n't study it , but that does n't mean in the real world that people do n't talk that way . so , it 's um professor d : yeah , i was n't saying that . right ? i was just saying that w now we 're looking at it . phd b : well , we 've als professor d : and and and , you you maybe wanted to look at it before but , for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you were n't . phd b : right . we 're looking at it here . professor d : so that 's why it 's coming to us as new even though it may well be you know , if your if your hypothes the hypothesis you were offering eh right ? if it 's the null poth { comment } hypothesis , and if actually you have as much overlap in a two - person , we do n't know the answer to that . the reason we do n't know the answer to is cuz it was n't studied and it was n't studied because it was n't set up . right ? phd b : yeah , all i meant is that if you 're asking the question from the point of view of what 's different about a meeting , studying meetings of , say , more than two people versus what kinds of questions you could ask with a two - person meeting . professor d : mm - hmm ? phd b : it 's important to distinguish that , you know , this project is getting a lot of overlap but other projects were too , but we just could n't study them . and and so uh professor d : may have been . may have been . right ? phd b : well , there is a high rate , professor d : we do kn we do n't know the numbers . phd b : so . it 's but i do n't know how high , in fact phd a : well , here i have a question . phd b : that would be interesting to know . professor d : see , i mean , i i le let me t i mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , `` what have we learned about overlaps here ? `` just never mind comparison with something else , phd b : mm - hmm . professor d : what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that the first the first - order thing i would say is that there 's a lot of them . right ? phd e : yeah . professor d : in in the sense that i if you said if i i i phd b : yeah , i i do n't di i agree with that . professor d : in a way , i guess what i 'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of how how much people overlap . uh you know the fact that when when when , uh , adam was looking for a stretch of of speech before , that did n't have any overlaps , and he w he was having such a hard time and now i look at this and i go , `` well , i can see why he was having such a hard time `` . phd b : right . that 's also true of switchboard . professor d : it 's happening a lot . phd b : it may not be professor d : i was n't saying it was n't . phd b : right . so it 's just , um professor d : right ? i was commenting about this . phd b : ok . all i 'm saying is that from the professor d : i 'm saying if i i 'm saying if i have this complicated thing in front of me , and we sh which , you know we 're gon na get much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data , but then , if i was gon na describe to somebody what did you learn right here , about , you know , the the modest amount of data that was analyzed i 'd say , `` well , the first - order thing was there was a lot of overlaps `` . in fact and it 's not just an overlap bunch of overlaps second - order thing is it 's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point , but that there 's overlaps , uh throughout the thing . grad h : right . phd b : right . no , i i agree with that . professor d : and that 's interesting . that 's all . phd b : i 'm just saying that it may the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting . professor d : oh yeah . phd b : and that 's all . professor d : yeah . yeah , i was n't making any statement about that . phd b : and and it would actually be interesting to find out professor d : yeah . phd b : because some of the data say switchboard , which is n't exactly the same kind of context , i mean these are two people who do n't know each other and so forth , but we should still be able to somehow say what what is the added contra contribution to sort of overlap time of each additional person , or something like that . professor d : yeah , that would be good to know , phd a : what professor d : but w we postdoc f : ok , now . grad h : i could certainly see it going either way . postdoc f : wh - yeah , i i agree i agree with adam . phd b : but yeah . phd e : yeah . postdoc f : and the reason is because i think there 's a limit there 's an upper bound on how many you can have , simply from the standpoint of audibility . when we speak we we do make a judgment of `` can `` you know , as adults . phd b : right . professor d : mm - hmm . postdoc f : i mean , children do n't adjust so well , i mean , if a truck goes rolling past , adults will well , depending , but mostly , adults will will will hold off to what to finish the end of the sentence till the till the noise is past . professor d : mm - hmm . postdoc f : and i think we generally do monitor things like that , about whether we whether our utterance will be in the clear or not . phd b : right . postdoc f : and partly it 's related to rhythmic structure in conversation , so , you know , you you t yeah , this is d also um , people tend to time their their their , um when they come into the conversation based on the overall rhythmic , uh uh , ambient thing . phd a : well phd b : right . postdoc f : so you do n't want to be c cross - cutting . and and , just to finish this , that um that i think that there may be an upper bound on how many overlaps you can have , simply from the standpoint of audibility and how loud the other people are who are already in the fray . but i you know , of certain types . now if it 's just backchannels , people may be doing that with less intention of being heard , just sort of spontaneously doing backchannels , in which case that those might there may be no upper bound on those . phd g : i i have a feeling that backchannels , which are the vast majority of overlaps in switchboard , uh , do n't play as big a role here , because it 's very unnatural i think , to backchannel if in a multi - audience you know , in a multi - person audience . phd b : if you can see them , actually . it 's interesting , so if you watch people are going like { comment } { comment } right right , like this here , phd g : right . phd e : yeah . phd b : but that may not be the case if you could n't see them . phd g : but but , it 's sort of odd if one person 's speaking and everybody 's listening , and it 's unusual to have everybody going `` uh - huh , uh - huh `` professor d : actually , i think i 've done it a fair number of times today . phd b : yeah . there 's a lot of head - nodding , in this phd g : yeah . grad h : yep , we need to put trackers on it . phd a : in in the two - person phd e : yeah , yeah , yeah . postdoc f : he could , he could . phd g : plus plus plus the yeah . so so actually , um that 's in part because the nodding , if you have visual contact , the nodding has the same function , but on the phone , in switchboard you you that would n't work . so so you need to use the backchannel . grad h : yeah , you do n't have it . your mike is phd a : so , in the two - person conversations , when there 's backchannel , is there a great deal of overlap in the speech ? grad h : that is an earphone , so if you just put it so it 's on your ear . phd a : or cuz my impression is sometimes it happens when there 's a pause , grad h : there you go . phd b : yeah . postdoc f : e for example . grad h : thank you . phd a : you know , like you you get a lot of backchannel , when somebody 's pausing phd b : yes . right . postdoc f : she 's doing that . phd b : sorry , what were you saying ? phd a : it 's hard to do both , huh ? um no , when when when there 's backchannel , i mean , just i was just listening , and and when there 's two people talking and there 's backchannel it seems like , um the backchannel happens when , you know , the pitch drops and the first person and a lot of times , the first person actually stops talking and then there 's a backchannel and then they start up again , and so i 'm wondering about h i just wonder how much overlap there is . is there a lot ? phd b : i think there 's a lot of the kind that jose was talking about , where i mean , this is called `` precision timing `` in conversation analysis , where they come in overlapping , but at a point where the information is mostly complete . so all you 're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words . phd a : mmm . mm - hmm . phd b : so technically , it 's an overlap . phd a : but maybe a just a small overlap ? phd b : but you know , from information flow point of view it 's not an overlap in the predictable information . phd e : more , yeah . grad h : it 'd be interesting if we could do prediction . phd a : i was just thinking more in terms of alignment , alignment overlap . phd b : yeah . grad h : language model prediction of overlap , that would be really interesting . phd g : so so phd b : well , that 's exactly , exactly why we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps ins in uh switchboard , professor d : yeah . phd g : right . grad h : right . phd b : say , because there 's a lot of that . phd g : so so here 's a here 's a first interesting labeling task . uh , to distinguish between , say , backchannels precision timing sort of you know , benevolent overlaps , and and and w and and sort of , um i do n't know , hostile overlaps , where someone is trying to grab the floor from someone else . grad h : mm - hmm . let 's pick a different word . phd e : yeah . phd g : uh , that that might be an interesting , um problem to look at . phd a : hostile takeovers . phd e : yeah . professor d : yeah . phd e : yeah . yeah . postdoc f : well , i mean you could do that . i ju i i think that in this meeting i really had the feeling that was n't happening , that the hostile hostile type . these were these were benevolent types , as people finishing each other 's sentences , and stuff . phd b : mm - hmm . phd g : um , i could imagine that as there 's a fair number of um cases where , and this is sort of , not really hostile , but sort of competitive , where one person is finishing something and you have , like , two or three people jumping trying to trying to trying to , uh grab the next turn . grad h : trying to get the floor . professor d : yeah . phd g : and so it 's not against the person who talks first because actually we 're all waiting for that person to finish . but they all want to be next . professor d : i have a feeling most of these things are that that are not a benevolent kind are are are , uh um are are competitive as opposed to real really really hostile . phd g : right . phd a : i wonder what determines who gets the floor ? postdoc f : yeah , i agree . i agree . phd a : i mean postdoc f : well , there are various things , you you have the professor d : uh a vote vote in florida . grad h : it 's been studied a lot . professor d : yeah . phd e : voting for professor d : um , o one thing i i wanted to or you can tell a good joke and then everybody 's laughing and you get a chance to g break in . phd g : seniority . professor d : but . but . um . you know , the other thing i was thinking was that , um these all these interesting questions are , of course , pretty hard to answer with , uh u you know , a small amount of data . so , um i wonder if what you 're saying suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have , um a a fair number of meetings with , uh a smaller number of people . right ? i mean we most of our meetings are uh , meetings currently with say five , six , seven , eight people should we really try to have some two - person meetings , or some three - person meetings and re record them just to to to beef up the the statistics on that ? postdoc f : that 's a control . well , it seems like there are two possibilities there , i mean i it seems like if you have just two people it 's not really , y like a meeting , w is not as similar as the rest of the of the sample . it depends on what you 're after , of course , but it seems like that would be more a case of the control condition , compared to , uh an experimental condition , with more than two . grad h : mm - hmm . professor d : well , liz was raising the question of of whether i it 's the number there 's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there , postdoc f : mm - hmm ."
