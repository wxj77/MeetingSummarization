    "answer": "lynne neagle am : hefin . hefin david am : is that all right , chair ? lynne neagle am : you 've got the floor , hefin . hefin david am : thank you , chair . you make a commitment to embedding physical activity at an early stage in primary school education . what would that look like ? dr frank atherton : just in terms of the physical activity , i have to say it 's a really important dimension and we need to move further on . we know not enough of our children are physically active and they 're not meeting the various guidelines , so it 's really important . it does n't actually have as much of an impact on weight as the dietary issue . i 'd just say that . it 's really important for all sorts of reasons . it does have an impact on healthy weight , but it has a huge impact in terms of socialisation , in terms of mental health issues , et cetera , you know . so\u2014i 'm sorry , i 've lost track of your question . nathan cook : i 'd just say that one thing we have got in train is , obviously , sport wales , public health wales and natural resources wales\u2014we have them working together as a collaborative at the moment to look at how their joint delivery on physical activity can be taken forward more efficiently . so , one of the things they are looking at is obviously the schools programmes they do through eco-schools , the welsh network of healthy schools and the sports programme to really think about that physical activity and how we can have better join up in terms of the programmes that we 're already delivering as well . hefin david am : with that in mind , i 'm going to confess to you , chief medical officer , i did anything in school i could to avoid physical education lessons . i hated it . i did n't feel engaged with it . yet , two weeks ago , i played for the assembly rugby team\u2014i wanted to get that in . the school sports survey , that would suggest that we 're still not hitting those targets with children . how can we get children more engaged with physical education in ways that\u2014 ? i felt completely alienated in school . dr frank atherton : well , you 're right , and many people go through that same journey and come to physical activity later in life , and that 's great if they do that . the sad reality is that many people do n't , and we also know that there are issues around the dropping off , particularly for girls , of physical activity towards the teenage years . so , there are specific moments that we need to understand . we do have a lot of information about these kinds of things . public health wales is very good at collating the information . we do need to turn that into programmes . i mean , at the heart of it , it 's about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive to people . sometimes that 's easier , i sense , for boys than for girls , but we need to tailor things to different audiences . hefin david am : yes , that 's the trick , is n't it ? it 's about finding out what children enjoy doing . that could be quite a wide and varied range of things . is that the key ? dawn bowden am : it 's not all about organised team sports . hefin david am : yes . as dawn said , it 's not just about organised team sports . there are some very individual activities you could do . dr frank atherton : absolutely , yes . and that 's where i think\u2014 . i 'm delighted that sport wales has moved beyond . it 's not just about elite sports ; it 's about getting everybody engaged and active in sports , and that partnership with public health wales that nathan talked about is really important , because we need a population approach to driving physical activity . hefin david am : so , do you think , with that in mind , we need statutory guidance for schools on physical education ? dr frank atherton : again , i 'd look to the consultation as to whether there was an appetite for any kind of guidance . it may well be that that is something that could be considered . hefin david am : okay . and finally , with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools , do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils ? dr frank atherton : i do n't have a personal view on that . i think it 's the quality of the food that kids are getting , whether that comes from home or through school , and whether it 's free or whether it 's paid for . i think it 's the quality of the food that we need to focus on . the question of children being hungry at school is a really important one and needs to be addressed at a national level . i think that 's a\u2014 hefin david am : so , you think that 's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet . dr frank atherton : i think it 's important that children have access to food , absolutely , if that 's your question , but we also need to look at the quality of the food and what 's in that food offer . hefin david am : but you do n't necessarily think universal provision would\u2014 . dr frank atherton : i do n't have a clear view on that . i know there 's a larger debate about that ."
