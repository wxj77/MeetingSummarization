    "answer": "project manager : would n't wan na be project manager . uh , what we going to do . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : um , once again i 'm uh gon na take minutes . so , um no presentation for me . uh , first we have a prototype presentation by g_ and g_ . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : afterwards some uh marketing : j_ and j_ . project manager : eval eval evalu industrial designer : evaluation . project manager : evaluation user interface : evaluation criteria . marketing : evaluation . project manager : s sorry . industrial designer : project manager : uh evaluation crit criteria . uh , in combination with the finance i um uh i received uh a an uh an excel uh file user interface : project manager : which we have to fill in later on . um , you see . uh , and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half euro . marketing : hmm . interesting . ah , okay . project manager : so , that 's uh that 's a big user interface : oops . marketing : cool . industrial designer : mm-hmm . that 's gon na be t problem . project manager : l so let 's uh wait it uh um marketing : project manager : we have we have must uh , user interface : some creative uh project manager : we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah , quite a lot of mathematics . user interface : oh . yeah . project manager : and after that , uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the smartboard , with the with our laptops , with the all uh all this . and uh afterwards , uh we closing . once again , forty minutes , so uh let 's start . user interface : ok okay . project manager : i would g give the word to um g_ and g_ for the prototype presentation . user interface : shall i give a short introduction and then uh industrial designer : yeah , well sure . marketing : j_ and j_ . project manager : j_ and j_ . user interface : okay . j_ and j_ , okay . marketing : jane and jane . project manager : marketing : 'kay guys , take it away . user interface : take it away . project manager : marketing : user interface : um , this was our first concept . we decided to use a single touch-screen . so , we 've worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and stuff . and um , well , we began with uh with a form of shape , that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . industrial designer : user interface : so , we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some ar artistic meaning . no ? this uh is n't nothing . marketing : project manager : user interface : idea maybe uh is better . project manager : user interface : um well , during the meeting i showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand , so it 's just gon na hold it easily . project manager : user interface : and it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too , of course . project manager : user interface : so we began uh working out a concept . industrial designer : yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel lcd uh screen . well , these would be the main buttons , h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to . but , well it 's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up . we have the more advanced menu uh setting right here . we have the sub-menus and stu stuff . we made a top oh , or a front view . just so like you wan na uh back view . as you can see , this uh there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : this is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic . and uh this is for the artistic effect . project manager : industrial designer : well , what we figured is uh we 'll show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that . but , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two . and so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . it wo n't uh roll around or stuff . but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old uh phones . y you you may get the idea . so thi this is about uh how we figured it should be . the s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers , like we discussed early on . uh , you would s you would n't see the uh straight panel , but more fluidly and round . user interface : yeah , the panel just uh of course goes like this . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff . project manager : no , okay . marketing : okay . industrial designer : and uh , in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics uh that would you can make a more thinner uh design , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and that would actually look very nice , yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and uh , about the colour , what have user interface : yeah . oh , we added that this um can be held with your hands for this maximum is om yeah , one and a half centimetres . so , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips . s and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip . marketing : okay . hmm . industrial designer : yeah , f uh , as colours , do you do you have the picture in uh user interface : yeah . industrial designer : oh yeah . now , well this is the idea about uh the bumps . uh , you can see there 's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior . it uh you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us . marketing : 's l it 's like an uh easter egg . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , it 's like an e but this is for children . we we want a more adult version . but , this is like a remote control for children . marketing : project manager : it 's called a weemote industrial designer : . a weemote . marketing : weemote . project manager : weemote . industrial designer : yeah . hey , that 's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand . user interface : project manager : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh , but marketing : wait what i w got in mind . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : so this actually basic the idea . we we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this . project manager : yeah , i can imagine that . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey . those are the technological colours actually , user interface : yeah . it would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , industrial designer : so it d user interface : so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , industrial designer : or blue or whatever . user interface : but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . and young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , ah i 'll buy for a couple of euros some noi nice hip uh marketing : hmm . maybe it 's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop . user interface : well , um i think a cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you 'll just have the lcd screen . marketing : yeah , okay . yeah , okay . user interface : so , there must be some cheap standard cover , um maybe white or something , marketing : hmm . mm . user interface : that 's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money . project manager : yeah , but uh you d you must n't forget that uh our target aim is younger people . marketing : oui okay . project manager : uh , we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it , uh and uh in the survey from uh milan and paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features . so i think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard , user interface : okay . the other way around , you mean . industrial designer : oh yeah . project manager : and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they 're willing to pay uh that . user interface : uh-huh . project manager : they want uh they want more luxury stuff , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so , maybe it 's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard . user interface : okay . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , maybe yeah , perhaps you 're right . uh , i i would i would actually agree with this sounds logical . user interface : okay , yeah . marketing : an another idea . uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style . project manager : yeah . marketing : they 'll please the elder users as well . project manager : yeah . user interface : well yeah , a colour of a wood style , a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours . project manager : yeah . user interface : and lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much . industrial designer : nah . yeah . marketing : yes . not not too uh yeah . user interface : this is banana and mango , not not purple or p orange and yellow . marketing : yeah , exactly . project manager : yeah . but , the mai i think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours . marketing : yeah . or blue or project manager : not too , but w a little , user interface : ah . mm-hmm . project manager : because that 's our aim . industrial designer : yeah , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : li like like this like this . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : this is n't this is n't too much , is it ? user interface : yeah , okay . no . yeah . marketing : . project manager : well , the buttons do n't have to be uh all uh all of industrial designer : yeah . the buttons , marketing : well i i i think so . industrial designer : i marketing : yeah , except for the buttons it 's it could be a standard model . project manager : yeah . it yeah . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah , uh something like this would be nice . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . industrial designer : okay , that 's that 's it from us . project manager : thank you . marketing : 'kay , it 's my time now . user interface : it 's my turn . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : the marketing expert . industrial designer : uh-oh . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : marketing : okay . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : during the user interface : industrial designer : marketing : oh . during the design uh design life-cycle we uh project manager : sorry . user interface : marketing : we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff . um , now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements . so we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . um , we 're going to do that with a seven point scale . opening a word document now . okay . one oh , okay , uh i have to expla explain something . we have to uh be consensive about about things . so , it has to be a group uh group decision . project manager : okay , marketing : okay ? project manager : so we gon we gon na evaluate the marketing : uh we 're going to vote . we project manager : yeah , the the thing we saw . marketing : yeah ? the prototype . project manager : okay , just saw . marketing : yeah . okay , one . the remote control is designed for people with age below forty . project manager : yeah . seven ? marketing : user interface : marketing : seven is false . project manager : uh , true . sorry . marketing : yeah , b one or project manager : yeah , one i think . marketing : most true ? industrial designer : yeah , it 's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty . it 's also designed for people above forty . marketing : yeah , project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so industrial designer : so marketing : so a o one is appropriate ? user interface : no no , a little more in the middle . marketing : or , more like a four . user interface : no , uh three or yeah . industrial designer : i have i 've marketing : three . industrial designer : yeah , two or three , because it 's not just uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . project manager : okay . industrial designer : but it 's also designed for people of age above forty . so , marketing : ah , exactly . exactly . industrial designer : i 'll say it 's about three . user interface : yeah , project manager : okay . user interface : it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty , but also appealing to marketing : three . project manager : marketing : yeah . but also for yeah , okay . uh , second . the remote control is beautiful . user interface : yeah . project manager : user interface : it 's industrial designer : marketing : yeah , acco according to us , it 's one ? or project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , industrial designer : yeah , i i think user interface : it 's the marketing uh angle on television . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , user interface : we have a wonderful marketing : p s of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product . user interface : yeah . project manager : user interface : well , it 's also fancy then . marketing : three . uh , the remote control looks fancy . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . of course . we have a perfect remote . marketing : good . four . the remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons . user interface : yes . yeah yeah , oh they have to agree but industrial designer : yeah . leads to user face , yeah . user interface : i 'm the user interface uh expert . marketing : daniel . uh , teletext buttons and volume buttons ? user interface : um , uh no . project manager : no teletext buttons . teletext is in the menu . user interface : you you 've different menu . industrial designer : yeah , false . marketing : false ? user interface : and volume is impo marketing : and volume ? project manager : volume is true . user interface : yeah . marketing : true . industrial designer : uh , hmm . marketing : big and clear ? project manager : industrial designer : yeah , the they are big and clear . . user interface : yeah yeah , big and clear . project manager : yeah , big and clear . user interface : but you could make a teletext button uh six . otherwise , the people who read this uh are gon na think we have no teletext button . marketing : hey . hide . project manager : industrial designer : yeah , but but the teletext button . yeah , you can ch that 's in a menu . marketing : it 's it 's not industrial designer : so , it 's w yeah , it it it marketing : yeah , it industrial designer : it is n't entirely unclear , but so , i would n't give it a seven . i would give it a more a five or a six . user interface : yeah . marketing : five ? industrial designer : uh , i don i do n't know . marketing : okay . industrial designer : what do you think , uh mister project manager ? marketing : yeah , it 's it 's yeah . project manager : oh , okay . well , i agree . i was thinking very black and white . marketing : user interface : black and red . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : project manager : thank you j_ . industrial designer : user interface : okay , do n't forget to save it . uh project manager : industrial designer : marketing : red . okay . volume . the remote control is easy to be found . user interface : uh well , when we put in fancy colours , yeah project manager : fruity . user interface : and marketing : industrial designer : yeah , it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so , if you so if you have trouble finding it user interface : but , um it it 's not making any sound uh , marketing : user interface : have we deciding ? marketing : oh , okay , user interface : so marketing : but if you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ? user interface : it 'll make a difference . we have the better re i do n't know . yeah , i think so . my remote control 's black . marketing : a li little bit maybe ? user interface : a little bit , but yeah . project manager : yeah . well , we p we can do it glow in the dark . marketing : four ? user interface : uh project manager : so , if it 's in the dark place , you still see it glowing . user interface : k yeah . marketing : i user interface : fo fo yeah fo five is . marketing : ah , i i i think five . it 's it 's it does n't really make a lot of industrial designer : well , then uh then i 'll go for four . marketing : four ? industrial designer : because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false . user interface : yeah , okay , you 're right . marketing : yes , but five is between four and six . project manager : i think industrial designer : so i 'll i 'll go for four . project manager : ah , you must see it as uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh tv room , this one will stand out , i think . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : yeah , that that 's a better question actually . marketing : yeah , project manager : exa i think that that 's what it 's about . user interface : yeah . marketing : it it 's user interface : if your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer , uh you find it , yeah ? project manager : if it if this lying on your couch , you 're you 're you think what 's that for kinda orange uh thing . marketing : yeah , yeah . project manager : so marketing : but but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , that 's stupid . industrial designer : marketing : like , no not uh not seeing it , but lost it in the house or something . project manager : okay . user interface : uh , but when you lost it you 're just not marketing : but , okay . industrial designer : well , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , uh then you 'd uh recognise it as , whoa , that is strange . project manager : that 's our remote control . user interface : yeah , mostly when you lose your remote control , it it 's under your marketing : yeah , okay . yeah , i i agree , i agree . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , what is that . uh , user interface : most of times when you lose it you 're sitting on it . uh industrial designer : so it 's marketing : okay . eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours . project manager : true . user interface : um i would call uh choose two , industrial designer : user interface : 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not . marketing : yeah , yeah , not too flashy . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : the remote control is made of soft material . project manager : industrial designer : yeah , rubber , is kind of soft . project manager : yeah , but not too soft we have decided . user interface : kinda soft , but but not this . yeah . marketing : three ? project manager : three , yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah yeah , easy to use , project manager : easy to use . one . user interface : very afford . marketing : easy to use ? project manager : yeah , can it be zero ? industrial designer : well , i don yeah , it is kind of marketing : top easy to use ? industrial designer : it marketing : it 's it 's not the most easy to use user interface : no , you can do two , because um industrial designer : no . uh marketing : it can be easier . user interface : it can be easier . but then you 're l industrial designer : it could yeah . marketing : jus just with ten buttons , that 's the easiest . user interface : yeah , but then you 'll lose project manager : yeah . user interface : function f yeah , functionality and our fancy uh look , so . industrial designer : functional ability . marketing : yeah , but the most uh easy to use is just with one button user interface : but it is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible . project manager : marketing : on t yeah , okay , but easy n not not the most easy to use , i think . industrial designer : . no , it 's it i i 'll go for two . my vote 's on two . project manager : okay , two . yeah , two . user interface : yeah , m mine too . marketing : we also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays . so user interface : yeah , but waits just a minutes . inspiration . project manager : what 's the time ? we also have uh to do the evaluation , uh the production costs and uh stuff . user interface : these are the m regular remotes . marketing : yeah yeah , i 'm uh hurrying . project manager : marketing : okay , eleven . the remote control is innovative . project manager : yeah . user interface : yes , true , one . project manager : you 're agree , tim ? marketing : a very of course . project manager : you have n't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh paris ? marketing : the remote control has m remova removable from multilux . industrial designer : user interface : yes , one . very multifunctional . project manager : marketing : the remote control , i it has speech recognition . project manager : false . marketing : false . industrial designer : it user interface : this is used with speech recognition , this . marketing : the remote control has built-in games ? project manager : user interface : yes . but uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh it 's not an entire game . project manager : yeah , but they are built in , so it 's one . industrial designer : yeah , they are built in . user interface : yeah , okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : not down . marketing : and the last , paren parental advisory function . industrial designer : you really like the parental advisory . project manager : freak . marketing : yes , i do . user interface : th did you make this or the marketing : save as . industrial designer : yeah , he made it . user interface : yeah , it changes it maybe . marketing : okay , i will uh user interface : oh yay . marketing : do the the math . user interface : oh dear . marketing : now it 's your turn . project manager : okay , thank you . marketing : project manager : we 'll see . mm . okay , we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost . if it 's under uh twelve and half euro , then it 's uh ok uh okay . but i is it if it is b huh ? no , this is n't right . okay so , . redesign . user interface : if they 're under twelve fifty . project manager : oh yeah , if they under yeah . no . oh yeah . yeah , it 's user interface : yeah ? cau 'cause so it 's okay . industrial designer : project manager : sorry . yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it . otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy . so uh , we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components . we have to uh fil uh , want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half euro . so , do we have uh a hand dynamo ? no . that 's zero . industrial designer : me , too . user interface : battery , yes . one . project manager : battery , one ? user interface : one , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . kinetic , one ? user interface : kinetic , one . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : okay , solar cells , zero . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay , uh simple chip on print ? industrial designer : uh , n no . project manager : no ? no , advanced chip . marketing : advanced chip . project manager : sample sensor sample speaker ? user interface : no , the advanced chip is uh marketing : advanced chip is three . project manager : three ? marketing : three euros , yep . project manager : yeah uh , but it it 's one one thing , it 's three euro . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh , we have one . we have one marketing : okay , one piece , yeah . industrial designer : . project manager : uh , what 's the sample sensor ? industrial designer : no , sev zero . well , that 's um marketing : speech recognition , i think . user interface : yeah , you give it a sample , uh one . industrial designer : yeah , speech recognition project manager : okay . zero . uh , uncurved flat . industrial designer : a zero . project manager : but is it s it 's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh and then uh user interface : you no . industrial designer : no . no . marketing : thingy . project manager : no ? okay . so it 's only uh once double-curved . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , 'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the uh the back of the marketing : three . eight . project manager : okay . we 're now in a problem , 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven euro yet . industrial designer : user interface : uh , we do n't have anything else . so industrial designer : marketing : okay , go on . just go on . project manager : okay , but uh we have industrial designer : just go on . then we 'll see uh we 'll we 'll see uh wha how much we are over budget . project manager : okay . user interface : could you step a little to the right ma yeah . oh , sorry . project manager : uh , rubber . user interface : or industrial designer : zero . project manager : titanium , no ? user interface : and zero . special uh is the special colour ? project manager : special colour ? industrial designer : i do n't think so . no , this is a standard colour . project manager : yeah , but we want to make uh the wood colours , uh that uh user interface : yeah . marketing : s industrial designer : yes , this is a special colour . user interface : yeah , if if you 're honest , we 'll uh type one , special colour . marketing : yeah , but but d but daniel , tha that 's that 's another brand . industrial designer : that 's an add-on . project manager : yeah , one . marketing : that 's another article to sell . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , but we we going to yeah yeah , that 's true . but yeah , it 's it 's it user interface : uh , j maybe we 'll finish uh the the list first and then look back , aye ? marketing : that does n't account for this . producing this . project manager : okay , the push-button , no . user interface : no . scroll wheel , no . project manager : scroll-wheel , no . user interface : no . project manager : no . oh , no . yes , one . user interface : project manager : uh , button , no . user interface : one , yeah . project manager : no , the the user interface : mm , is it project manager : we do n't have a s user interface : no . no . industrial designer : these three . project manager : no . okay . industrial designer : well , we 're only four euro over budget . project manager : oh , okay . so , um what 's the thing we can change ? user interface : so industrial designer : but user interface : no . no . industrial designer : well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved . project manager : uh , can i uh i say something ? user interface : mm , single-curves . marketing : yeah . project manager : no , can i say something uh as project manager ? marketing : yeah , of course . user interface : yeah . project manager : the kinetic thing , can we just skip it , user interface : just cut off the kine yeah . project manager : because uh you have to shake it , but that 's not really innovative . user interface : or industrial designer : yeah . okay , sure . user interface : yeah . yeah , we just put a good battery it it . marketing : yeah . user interface : mobile phones nowadays . project manager : yeah . marketing : daniel . daniel , project manager : yo . sorry , marketing : what do you think about here . project manager : yeah , yes . marketing : what do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station project manager : yeah . marketing : just apart from the from the thing , so that you can uh put uh project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : rechargeable batteries in it and just project manager : okay . user interface : but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual . project manager : yeah , and not really . marketing : yeah , yeah , okay . project manager : but we if you forget about the kinetic , marketing : just an idea . user interface : yeah , that 's a cost reduc industrial designer : yeah , sure . marketing : yeah . project manager : well if we do that , we shall . user interface : ah . industrial designer : okay , project manager : so um industrial designer : well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . marketing : yeah , of course . industrial designer : and that would solve the budget problem . project manager : uh , b but i but the single-curved is just oh user interface : yeah , so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then industrial designer : yeah . user interface : no , it 's it 's just one curve and not a back uh curved i think . or industrial designer : it 's just yeah well , the single-curve that project manager : oh , okay , okay . industrial designer : yeah . exactly , yeah . project manager : so that 's wh tha that 's one option . user interface : or are these two curves ? uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : and then w yeah , and then we could have it , but uh it 's its ' well it 's it 's r it is the main point of the the the the look . marketing : yeah , user interface : yeah , but what else uh do we have to cut out ? no advanced chip , uh that 's a little bit of problem . industrial designer : we going to cut project manager : no , tho uh that that can be done . marketing : yeah . project manager : so uh , user interface : although , can we make it with a regular chip ? project manager : okay , a little less uh conversation . user interface : curvy . marketing : hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? project manager : sorry ? marketing : the blue blue uh project manager : fill in just a user interface : explanation . marketing : okay . project manager : explanation . user interface : twelve fifty . project manager : i can delete it for you if you want . user interface : well industrial designer : marketing : no , no no . project manager : so , if we do this , uh we 're on uh twelve and a half euro . and we 're done . user interface : yeah , but does it fit with our design ? project manager : uh well , the only uh thing that do n't user interface : do we have to u adapt it ? it 's single-curves . project manager : yeah , single-curved , but there 's a curve in it . so marketing : yeah . user interface : w could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back , and then we 're uh has industrial designer : yeah , we just make it flat . user interface : okay . industrial designer : but , you do l marketing : but , wha 'kay , look , what is the uh if you make it double-curved , it costs one euro more . user interface : more . yeah . you make it optional . marketing : but no , but does it have a lot of extra uh industrial designer : function . user interface : functional . marketing : fun function more like industrial designer : worth , does it have added worth ? user interface : uh , there 's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : no , um project manager : yeah , it 's really a static value . yeah . marketing : yeah , uh aesthetic . i mean , uh you make like eleven and a half euros profit instead of twelve and a half . but i do n't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price . project manager : yeah , it is . oh . industrial designer : yeah , well let 's assume it is . marketing : no , we ca n't go above that . industrial designer : we we should assume it i that it is . marketing : yeah ? project manager : yeah , okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but i i figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . marketing : yeah , okay . then it 's okay . industrial designer : r if you uh promote a kinetic um i kinetic remote control , i mean , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : do you think ? well , now you can shake your remote control . marketing : yeah , i think so . industrial designer : no , well , y i mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic . project manager : kinetic . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you have standard old battery control uh remote con marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : what a what about all the m the environment freaks ? user interface : yeah , but it does n't fit in our co cost profile . so marketing : not freaks , industrial designer : marketing : the envi no . industrial designer : true . marketing : i i think it 's it 's it look like this one . user interface : you ma can make an an especialised extra gold version . project manager : yeah ? who because if you want to go to kinetic , you 're uh you 're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , marketing : project manager : and i think now it 's it 's more of uh a compromise user interface : yeah . project manager : thing . marketing : yeah . project manager : and if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , then it 's uh then it 's uh marketing : user interface : yeah , just one big curve . project manager : yeah , one big good curve . industrial designer : project manager : i was going to uh say nasty words , but i do n't . industrial designer : project manager : this is strange by the way . marketing : project manager : wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber . we thought that wood would be more expensive . marketing : yeah . user interface : uh , this uh american figures . you just cut down some trees . project manager : yeah , maybe . but uh that this is this is it ? yeah . okay , this is it . marketing : this is it . user interface : whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium . project manager : i 'm gon na save it . yeah . user interface : yes . industrial designer : it is possible , but you ca n't use double uh curves for titanium . that 's one of the functionability uh project manager : okay , well , considering we have marketing : ah no , we have to do all those hours again . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : go back . one back ? costs on uh no redesign . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : well , we were above , so we did a little redesign marketing : yeah . user interface : we sue . we yeah , we 'll start her all o all over again . marketing : yeah , okay , yeah . project manager : okay , um now uh it 's about time to uh talk about uh this project . uh , some uh things . were there uh room for uh was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? user interface : um marketing : hmm . i i did n't think so . that there was a lot of room for it . but , that 's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us . project manager : yeah . marketing : it was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , and i could n't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . bu project manager : yeah . yeah , yeah , yeah . that 's true . i agree with that . industrial designer : well , i th i think you two , uh especially you and uh and uh daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project . project manager : yeah . that 's true . marketing : yeah . user interface : for us , there was a lot of creativity . industrial designer : 'cause i think m user interface : we could just sign up an uh remote if we liked . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , that 's true . industrial designer : i think jeroen and i , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . yeah , that 's true . project manager : okay . uh how about the leadership ? user interface : uh industrial designer : ha . marketing : leadership was uh crappy . project manager : user interface : crappy . cra industrial designer : nah , the leadership was n't crappy , it was the leader that was crappy . project manager : okay , thank you very much . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : nah . no , the leadership was okay . marketing : project manager : now we 're done . user interface : yeah , example of crappy leadershi marketing : no , leadership was uh user interface : okay , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , it was good . marketing : okay , i thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . project manager : yeah , that 's true . marketing : uh , you could have but uh , it was your first , no uh no disrespect or something , project manager : industrial designer : marketing : but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more . project manager : yeah . marketing : so like , i i was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and user interface : you could of said , shut up you fool . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . i notice it too . marketing : but project manager : i was a i was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the marketing : about me . project manager : about the first meeting . industrial designer : project manager : so , uh i hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh industrial designer : try to learn from your mistake . and we will never do it again . marketing : yeah , you made up . project manager : get better and uh i think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk marketing : no , it you did better . user interface : yeah , more more consensus . project manager : yeah . user interface : ev everybody w was agreeing every marketing : yeah . much more constructive . project manager : okay , so uh that 's cool . user interface : yeah . project manager : uh , teamwork ? well , maybe that 's uh only yeah well , it 's for us , because uh user interface : well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . project manager : yeah . yeah and it 's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . user interface : so , it is a little bit marketing : project manager : but , really teamwork were you two uh user interface : yeah . no well , it went okay . marketing : two guys . project manager : the industrial designer : yeah , that went w it went well . project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : it 's it 's just uh user interface : stupid stupid pen , but uh project manager : no hard feelings . industrial designer : nah . yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but project manager : yeah . now you you must push a little while . user interface : yeah , but but draw something uh difficult . industrial designer : yeah , but us user interface : d uh just write your name right now . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : try to write your name , project manager : okay . user interface : in in writing letters , of course , yeah ? yeah , normally , uh this uh the w block letter sign it , yeah ? project manager : o just uh user interface : just just write your name in in one line . project manager : okay . user interface : if it 's a little bit too small bit quicker now . project manager : you can be you can go quicker , 'cause then it it wo n't notice it . user interface : it did n't uh he he knows how it works , yeah . industrial designer : oh . project manager : i follow the master class for the smartboard , so i think that 's the that 's the main issue . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : okay . project manager : um , so uh about this one you were uh you 're dealing with , marketing : means . industrial designer : project manager : um the the the the digital pen . user interface : y well , yeah . th the i the idea is great , but it does n't work properly . uh project manager : okay . yeah . marketing : digital pen , i thought uh th the first time i did individual work , i used it . project manager : yeah . marketing : but , a and the first two meetings i brought it with me , but i did n't use it at all after the first the first meeting . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : no , i have it working . but , uh yeah , well uh marketing : it 's it 's not real real use for me . industrial designer : no , it does n't have that much added value to the project manager : huh . well user interface : nee . as uh as i said a m a c few moments ago , it i would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must um yeah , it 's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . project manager : yeah . user interface : i it 's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow . project manager : m yeah . yeah . and it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh word . user interface : yes . no , and it does n't give any added value . project manager : no , uh that 's true . no . marketing : not really , no . project manager : and uh the smartboard is uh useful , but the the pen is i uh not user-friendly , i think . user interface : yeah , not user-friendly . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , marketing : user interface : yeah , and it 's it 's not very precise . project manager : and that 's the user interface : we 're trying to m to marketing : yeah , like when you do this . user interface : yeah , it may um yeah , and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size , yeah . smaller . marketing : smaller ? user interface : yeah , smaller . just like when you 're writing on a letter . project manager : yeah , but that 's not th the the you when you at a foreign audience , you b do n't gon na wr uh write uh small . user interface : no , a as you saw on on this drawing , just open open this one or that one . it 's uh th it it yeah , uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it 's almost impossible to get clear uh when you 're uh project manager : yeah . marketing : oh . sorry . project manager : but maybe there 's some function with no , it is n't . with uh user interface : and the eraser was another problem . it w t is is this large . and when you try to erase this line , y project manager : yeah . well , i 'm gon na erase my uh name . user interface : i 'm gon na erase my name there . project manager : yeah , it 's a big uh big eraser . marketing : okay . new ideas ? user interface : m abo what kind of new ideas ? project manager : um well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh marketing : do you ? user interface : yeah , uh project manager : marketing : go on . project manager : i 'm just uh user interface : new ideas about uh the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or marketing : yeah . mm , yeah , i think so . project manager : i do n't know what what i mean . no . user interface : hello . industrial designer : marketing : did you heard what he said ? industrial designer : know what i mean . marketing : i do n't i do n't know what i mean . oh , i have some figure . industrial designer : marketing : here . project manager : oh . marketing : the eva the evaluation , project manager : oh yeah . marketing : the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six . project manager : that 's interesting . marketing : so that 's fairly uh fairly good , i think . project manager : okay , user interface : yeah . project manager : because what does it mean ? user interface : so true . marketing : uh , that uh project manager : all the mo yeah , are between one and two . marketing : all the requirements uh are true or very true , right . yep . project manager : yeah . oh , okay . yeah , okay . thank you , expert . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : but the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software ? user interface : not really , just they have to improve it . project manager : not really , yeah ? user interface : uh , the concept is okay , project manager : yeah , i think user interface : but it has to be quicker . uh , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process project manager : yeah . user interface : and it , yeah , just takes too many time . people will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and project manager : yeah . you had expected it to to be uh more more uh user interface : more user-friendly . project manager : yeah . user interface : 'cause when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : and you do marketing : may maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here . user interface : yeah . marketing : and draw it , and it 's it 's placed over there . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , that l project manager : yeah . user interface : would be easier . or at least when you you do n't have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . and now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you 're drawing on this screen . marketing : hmm ? no . user interface : and that 's a very bad concept . project manager : yep , yep . yeah , that 's true . marketing : ah , very bad . user interface : nah , okay , i i it 's my opinion that i marketing : but i think this is better than regular flip-overs , but user interface : yeah , it 's can be saved easier . marketing : yeah . user interface : but if you 're in normal flip-over you a lot of people write text . there 's no text option . marketing : yeah . user interface : and writing text uh , yeah , you 've got ta really do your best to write some project manager : yeah , and and maybe some uh functions for uh uh uh circle or uh a square . you have to draw it yourself now . user interface : yeah . or maybe even insert picture . marketing : yeah . user interface : if you have uh some presentation , and you have some f project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or text function . just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mean marketing : yeah , but insert image is n't available ? user interface : 'cause then you could marketing : here . picture from scanner , clip-art . project manager : yeah , that that can be done already . user interface : oh , okay . project manager : but not the the the the predefined uh squares i think uh user interface : so you can marketing : hyperlink ? hey , what if you do like hyperlink ? user interface : with uh w_w_ dot google dot com . marketing : type type it ? user interface : oh yeah . maybe . marketing : re real reaction dot n_l_ . project manager : hmm ? sorry ? marketing : yes , is now is okay . okay ? user interface : you 'll just make a link in yeah . project manager : well , that 's nice . user interface : there 's one way to uh project manager : is it marketing : 'kay , double-click it . user interface : maybe if if you 're not using the eraser project manager : here . oh . oh , sorry . marketing : you 're erasing . user interface : something else th yeah , arrow . project manager : yeah . here , that . marketing : double-click it . user interface : okay . project manager : so you have user interface : well , it 's project manager : as you saw , you have a little uh oh , you can yeah , thank you . you can go uh user interface : yeah , okay . project manager : there . so there the the the functionality is there , but it 's not it 's not ideal , user interface : but project manager : and it 's it 's very user interface : . project manager : it costs a lot of time to uh user interface : to use , yeah . project manager : to use . and that 's a pity , marketing : yeah . project manager : if you uh if you have uh thirty , forty minutes uh for this kind of things , user interface : yeah . project manager : and we are now with four people , user interface : and that 's m project manager : but it well , imagine you are here you 're with the ten people and everyone uh user interface : that 's mostly the case , from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , project manager : yeah . user interface : and if you have to do all this kind project manager : two minutes of drawing , yeah . user interface : you 'll rather use powerpoint and work it out in advance . project manager : yeah . user interface : and th the one or two things you have to draw when you 're there , just use a flip-board . project manager : yeah . marketing : what i really miss also is uh industrial designer : project manager : marketing : is a d is a turtle industrial designer : marketing : is a decision uh decision system like um with the evaluation , you have to polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , project manager : yeah yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven . project manager : yeah , just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write , also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism . marketing : yeah , j ju ju yeah , v voting application . project manager : yeah . marketing : just a little group group decision application . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but uh , problem is , well you ca n't discuss anything well you you ca uh you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . we i mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but , well uh i we said uh , no i w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react uh on it . marketing : yeah , okay . industrial designer : but if you you put a three on it , uh just figure well , everybody knows what i 'm knowing , so they 'll all just put a two on . marketing : yeah , of course . but , uh you can still discuss about it , industrial designer : yeah , but it would yeah . marketing : but but click it in an application , that 's a lot easier to process . industrial designer : yeah okay , the for processing part . marketing : the digit . yeah . industrial designer : but then uh , i think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it , that uh is n't that bad idea , actually . project manager : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : not that your opinion is n't valued , but but still . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : yeah . okay , so user interface : okay . marketing : okay . user interface : yo , manager . marketing : that 's it ? project manager : uh well , just about , user interface : when are w industrial designer : project manager : because uh marketing : user interface : when are we going to produce it ? project manager : yeah , tomorrow ? uh , the costs are within the budget . marketing : celebration . project manager : uh , the project is evaluated . marketing : yeah . project manager : but , before we going to celebrate , uh i have uh a little question which you ca n't answer , marketing : yeah . project manager : because uh there must be some kind of end report . i am busy with the end report right now . you might thinking what the hell was he doing uh marketing : what is an end report ? project manager : uh about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r r a report of this day . marketing : yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : uh , that must be made , but i do n't know , here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is marketing : oh , you ha you have ten minutes left , i uh read . you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report . project manager : okay well , that uh that can be done . maybe we can do it uh together . you can see what i 've uh yeah ? marketing : yeah . project manager : so i i s i will uh put it on a story-board . industrial designer : yeah , sure . project manager : you can see it . because i think it will uh it must be uh marketing : um you you already made a beta version , or project manager : yeah , it 's a three uh with seventy five uh marketing : pages . project manager : yeah , just about . industrial designer : y yikes . seventy five pages . project manager : well , just a moment . end report . marketing : okay , daniel . industrial designer : marketing : do you want a chair maybe ? user interface : a chairman . industrial designer : project manager : no no no , i 'm just uh marketing : oh , okay . project manager : you can s you can read it and uh here here it is . end report . industrial designer : so you you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ? project manager : well , this not nit it user interface : yes . project manager : read-only . but it 's not uh fully finished yet . marketing : five minutes for finishing . project manager : um , this is about the functional design , the things yeah yeah . marketing : management expert , you have to change that . project manager : oh yeah . i 'm uh when i said it , i remember i had it here . marketing : marketing . user interface : it 's a read-only version . marketing : yeah , but you can save it u the under another name . user interface : oh , okay . project manager : marketing expert , okay . um about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control . um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . so , this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh yeah . marketing : maybe um the user interface : uh project manager : yeah , i understand you , i can talk a little bit dutch . marketing : the yeah . user interface : marketing : you yeah . industrial designer : marketing : no , you have to put uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that 's the most used function and teletext at the second project manager : oka okay , okay , i i really did n't knew that . marketing : oh nay , a volume changing , second . project manager : so , this one 's first . marketing : s switch , yes . project manager : you go there and you go there . so , okay . marketing : yeah . okay , go on . project manager : well , maybe i can then do it one two three . marketing : yes , very good . user interface : one two three . project manager : if the order is in uh is is uh important , marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : that 's the word for . marketing : the order . project manager : then the conceptual design . uh , well all the things we have uh discussed , uh the energy , which uh turn out to be uh batteries , so that 's user interface : yeah . well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost . project manager : yeah , because yeah . uh , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable . marketing : single-curves . project manager : uh , the buttons industrial designer : it 's not double . project manager : hmm ? user interface : a single-curved . industrial designer : uh , it 's not double anymore , eh ? project manager : not double anymore . marketing : no , okay . project manager : nay but that this is what um industrial designer : yeah , okay . marketing : was initial , the plan . the initial plan . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and the the added functions like tetris snake , it 's under the parental control , the touch-screen . industrial designer : project manager : so , it 's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh industrial designer : on thing uh one small thing uh , the added functions . uh , was it included in the cost ? i do n't think so , eh ? user interface : ah , it 's very cheap . project manager : uh , it 's very cheap , industrial designer : it 's very cheap . marketing : project manager : you you maybe you you you you come at uh marketing : no , it 's it 's not very cheap , but that project manager : it 's very necessary . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : no , but it 's a development inside corporation . like , uh w we do n't have to buy parental control . our own people can make that , i think . project manager : yeah , but it still has some user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , it it has some cost , but project manager : yeah . okay , but so we can discuss that uh user interface : he 'll do it in his free time . so uh project manager : we can discuss that kind of things i think with the with the the board of uh industrial designer : marketing : yeah . user interface : of directur or directors . project manager : what 's it what 's the company called ? i just keep forgetting it . marketing : real reaction . project manager : real real reaction . industrial designer : marketing : user interface : yeah . project manager : real reaction , yeah . user interface : you can ask your personal industrial designer

's that 's what i 'm gon na write b between now . marketing : okay . still the end conclusion . that 's all , i think . project manager : but , i in here nothing uh user interface : um , the decision to make um the buttons on the top , and the menu on the project manager : mm-hmm . yes . user interface : on the bottom . and clearly yeah , touch-screen you 've mentioned . project manager : yeah , touch-screen i 've mentioned . marketing : yeah , but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion , i think . user interface : okay . marketing : why we decided to use a flat uh lcd . user interface : okay , this n yeah . project manager : yeah , okay , well i gon na redesign uh something now . no . marketing : yeah . um user interface : party party . project manager : because i think
