    "answer": "marketing : um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . and basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh were n't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well . so we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . and fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there 's many buttons and it 's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . um and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . we also asked some users about some specific features that they 'd like to see in the on the remote control . in particular , do they want an lcd d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . project manager : marketing : um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . they want these features , they want these high technology features . industrial designer : marketing : um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . so i guess it depends on where we 're focusing our our market . um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um i think we 're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . that 's my dic that 's my presentation . thank you . project manager : thank you . industrial designer : user interface : okay . project manager : so , um maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . so uh pet peter , can you talk say something about that ? industrial designer : well , okay , yeah . yeah , but the user user interface is responsible . user interface : b you think uh i i 'm user interface manager . industrial designer : okay , so . marketing : project manager : sorry , i 'm sorry . sorry . user interface : okay . okay . if i could go there with this cable . industrial designer : you 're scaring me with lcd man . and speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive . marketing : yeah , it 's true , but , you know , they 're features that users want , industrial designer : marketing : so it 's industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and our production cost of twelve fifty euros per per unit is fairly high i think , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so i think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote . industrial designer : at least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . but i 'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . this i prefer that we should make ourselves . marketing : okay . industrial designer : but it depends whether we take a decision to use it . same thing . it 's fairly expensive to use these circuits . so , speech recognition well , lcd it 's okay because it 's common nowadays to use lcd , project manager : industrial designer : so i agree on using any kind of lcd , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know . project manager : yeah . so what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? industrial designer : yeah , i 'm project manager : or it would be maybe feasible ? industrial designer : oh . i was not thinking too much about the price . but if we use the lcd uh even the radio frequency communication with the tv set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . if we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we 'll see afterwards . user interface : and uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ? industrial designer : yes yes . project manager : i think user interface : i i thin i think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it 's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . it does n't take that much place and also that much it does n't cost that much . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life , then . if we use the speech recognition . project manager : so maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time . user interface : mm-hmm ."
