    "answer": "user interface : okay . um okay , so the interface concept um . yeah . the interface specification , what people um how they interact with it basically , i think . um so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what 's good about them , what 's bad about them , um i looked at their flaws , so we 're going to look at their flaws , everything . um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : uh the findings , i 've got some pictures to show you as well . project manager : either . industrial designer : user interface : yeah . okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . project manager : uh okay . user interface : um and we also found that there 's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . so i think for our remote control there is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but i think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , project manager : right , okay . yeah . user interface : i think , people find that important , 'cause then it 's easy to use . project manager : user interface : and we 've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . project manager : excellent . user interface : do i press escape f_ five ? or just project manager : uh no just escape should uh user interface : escape , okay . um , oh i still have n't got my glasses on . yeah , okay . so these are the some of the pictures of existing ones . project manager : user interface : i 'll just walk you through them . this one is a voice recognition . project manager : 'kay . user interface : and that 's the kind of idea we 're going for . project manager : looks pretty complicated . user interface : there 's um an lcd thing , which we thought could i thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . project manager : right , okay . user interface : this one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , project manager : mm-hmm , like the middle button . user interface : which yeah . project manager : okay . user interface : um and but i 'm not exactly sure how you 'd use that , industrial designer : project manager : ah it 's kinda like scrolling user interface : like would the computer come project manager : uh right , well , if i s if i 'm thinking of the right one , i 've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . user interface : uh-huh , that 's like the lcd one , project manager : right , okay . user interface : is it ? but the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . but i presume that the functions must come up on the tv screen . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , presumably . user interface : i think that 's what that is . so these are just a few ideas . again that 's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , i think on that one . industrial designer : uh it looks threatening . project manager : yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . user interface : yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . industrial designer : it looks like yeah . user interface : um this one i thought was really cool . it 's w it 's got the programmability function that we talked about . industrial designer : user interface : you can put it in there , it 's for your kids , and it 's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . project manager : okay . user interface : and that 's really easy to use , bright , so i like this one lot for our design . i think something like that would be good . project manager : yeah , i m i mean the one thing i think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , i 've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . user interface : of course yellow . project manager : so like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . user interface : right , yeah . yeah , that 's true . yeah . um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the tv or something . and this one , the over-sized one , i do n't know about you , but i think it 's a bit too gimmicky . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : i do n't think that will sell very well . project manager : i mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? user interface : i guess so . i do n't know . industrial designer : then d blind do n't watch tv . project manager : strange . user interface : i think that 's a bit yeah exactly . project manager : no they do , they do . industrial designer : they do ? project manager : they listen to it . yeah . user interface : yeah . and um this one is just pointing out . i like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . project manager : right , okay . user interface : so that could that 's a bit confusing . um but the buttons on this i think are it 's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . they do n't have to be all the same . so that 's quite cool . um . project manager : 'kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , do n't they ? user interface : yeah , exactly . um f_ five . yes . so there are some of the findings . so we need to combine those ones um industrial designer : user interface : and i 've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . project manager : brilliant . that 's handy . user interface : um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . um so i think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good ."
