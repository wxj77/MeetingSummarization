    "answer": "sian gwenllian am : as we know , of course , the work with her majesty 's revenue and customs has ended , and i know you were n't the minister who initiated this process , but what exactly has gone wrong ? what are these issues that have come to light that have made you suspend that ? it 's very frustrating for us , as a committee , who scrutinised that extensively and raised a lot of concerns about that . and a lot of time has been spent talking about this funding bill , and money\u2014\u00a31 million , i understand\u2014has been wasted , if you like , unnecessarily . so , what exactly has gone wrong ? why are n't you discussing these things with hmrc ? yes . so , thank you for that explanation . julie morgan am : i 've got more to say as well . sian gwenllian am : yes , but for your transparency around your particular view that it needs to be more flexible and expanded upon and , therefore , going down the hmrc route was\u2014 julie morgan am : it would have restricted us a lot . sian gwenllian am : yes . we knew that from the beginning . i mean , that 's , you know\u2014 . so , it was a principle decision rather than any sort of technical matters to do with the welsh language standards . that 's been cited as one kind of\u2014 . but i 'm really understanding more now that , really , what it 's about is that you want to have a more flexible , and expand on the offer and that this would curtail\u2014going through hmrc would put limits on that . julie morgan am : that is one of the reasons , but there were issues about the welsh language , which we can go into in detail , if you 'd like . there were some issues about that . they would be able to process things bilingually , and i think that was probably told to the committee when we looked at the hmrc . but , in terms of the welsh language standards that the minister has to use , there would be some difficulties in them doing it . sian gwenllian am : but would you say that your main change came about because you wanted to be more flexible rather than any difficulties\u2014 julie morgan am : one of the major reasons , i think\u2014 sian gwenllian am : okay . good . julie morgan am : but there are\u2014 . as i say , there are other reasons . those technical reasons probably do end up being quite important\u2014 sian gwenllian am : but the committee was told by the previous minister that hmrc would n't have any problem at all with delivering according to the welsh language standards . julie morgan am : do you want to add something to this ? nicola edwards : so , in terms of some of the technical issues we had , if you want to start with the bilingual provision and the welsh language standards , hmrc do provide a bilingual service at the moment for their customers in line with their welsh language scheme , and i think we can all appreciate that schemes are quite different from the requirements of the standards . and there were some issues when we got into the detail of the standards that the welsh ministers are required to deliver to that caused some concerns in terms of how hmrc were going to do it , particularly in terms of the multiple it systems that go into building up the childcare services . so , for example , there are a number of what are called 'special characters ' in the welsh alphabet , such as the to bach , for example . the hmrc it system has some issues with that . sian gwenllian am : yes , well , with due respect , the to bach has always been there\u2014 nicola edwards : oh , yes , i completely agree . unfortunately , however\u2014 sian gwenllian am : \u2014and hmrc would have been able to tell you , really early on , you would have thought , that it was\u2014 . i do n't really want to go into it , because i think we 've got to the crux of why hmrc was dropped . i think it 's been dropped because julie feels that the offer needs to be more flexible , and i can understand why you would say that ."
