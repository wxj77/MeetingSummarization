    "answer": "sian gwenllian am : do you , therefore , believe that this needs to be on the face of the bill ? that is , you do n't say this in your evidence . i 'd like to know your opinion on that . scotland is going to be making it a duty for scottish ministers to raise awareness of the impact of the bill . so far , the welsh government says that we do n't need to do that in wales . would n't it make it clearer for you if it was a clear duty on the face of the bill , for example as it was with the human transplantation ( wales ) act 2013 ? there was a duty in that act for ministers to promote transplantation . surely , that awareness raising aspect would be clearer for everyone if it was on the face of the bill . do you have an opinion on that ? huw david : well , welsh government have given that commitment , and i know the welsh government honour every commitment that they make\u2014 [ laughter . ] sian gwenllian am : that 's why i 'm asking . huw david : i do n't know whether that is necessary\u2014i 'm not a legislator . i think that there 's obviously an inherent interest in welsh government raising awareness , because we have to raise awareness effectively for this to be successful , otherwise we will have parents who feel that they 're being criminalised , and that 's the last thing we want . i think it 's worthy of consideration , but , as i say , i 'm not a legislator or a lawyer , so i do n't know what implications that will have long term . but to be fair to welsh government , i think that commitment is one that i 'm sure will be honoured , because welsh government will want to make a success of this bill if it does receive royal assent . sian gwenllian am : okay . but is it clear who would pay for all of that ? huw david : i 've suddenly changed my mind\u2014 [ laughter . ] i think it should be a duty on welsh government ministers\u2014absolutely . i do n't need to check with lawyers or legislators . there we go . and that 's the wlga position ; i do n't need to ask the other 21 leaders on that either . [ laughter . ] sian gwenllian am : would n't it make it clearer if there was a clear duty on the face of the bill that awareness raising had to happen ? it would be clearer , then , for local authorities and people in the front-line services what needs to happen ."
