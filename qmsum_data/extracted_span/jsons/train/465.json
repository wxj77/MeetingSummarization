user interface : um , it did n't work anymore . marketing : the laptop ? user interface : the entire windows uh marketing : it hang hung . user interface : it it hung . project manager : marketing : ha-ha . oh . project manager . project manager : yes . yes . industrial designer : marketing : you 're our project manager . project manager : your project manager . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : welcome to the conceptual design meeting industrial designer : marketing : project manager : for real reaction . marketing : project manager : uh , hello again . uh it 's uh the same as the last time . uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations . industrial designer : project manager : and we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . um uh , and at the end , uh i uh , when i finish it off i have some uh input from uh a master class i uh visited . information . marketing : industrial designer : user interface : during lunch , yeah . marketing : master . user interface : he 's the master , yeah . project manager : industrial designer : project manager : the the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on . um uh , our from uh are of two sorts . marketing : master of project manager : components concepts and user interface concepts . uh , the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh well , we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so uh it wo n't be uh uh as breakable . uh how how about the energy ? can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange ? uh , the user interface concept . uh , with the type and uh the the supplements . so uh where to put what button . and uh uh i would say uh jans , can you begin ? industrial designer : yeah , sure . project manager : okay . marketing : project manager : at the end , uh i will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder . industrial designer : okay . uh , let me see . i think it 's this one . ha . right . uh , well , i 'll be talking about the components . marketing : industrial designer : uh , what i did was i reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh below forty five and above . and uh i just uh watch what the differences are and i checked uh , well , what what d do we want , and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group . well uh what i found was that a senior um project manager : industrial designer : senior citizens uh marketing : i 'm sorry . industrial designer : ye ah , it 's it 's okay . marketing : okay . go on . industrial designer : uh they , well , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more . marketing : industrial designer : wood and chrome . project manager : industrial designer : and uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . um , uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials . think of the teletubbies , for instance . project manager : industrial designer : uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and marketing : industrial designer : well uh , shapes are curved and round . marketing : industrial designer : y y you get the picture . and uh they like sports and gaming , and that gives them uh the vitality . uh , so w well uh , firs project manager : one one little question . um about the the material . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh a soft material for a remote control ? industrial designer : no , i 'll i 'll get to that . project manager : okay . yeah . industrial designer : you you 'll see . yeah . project manager : thank you . industrial designer : uh , well f first off , let 's start start with the energy . w i uh i had a choice between uh a few different uh sources . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but uh the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . uh kinetic , that 's when you move something , then uh it gets energy . i figured , well that 's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power . that would be actually very nice , uh i figured . well , we could also use a battery , that 's a bit marketing : yeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ? project manager : user interface : industrial designer : yeah . yeah yeah , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit . marketing : uh , and uh uh industrial designer : and then then it d then it has some more uh energy . project manager : industrial designer : well , y you could just go for a battery . or you can go for both ? user interface : oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? industrial designer : yeah , i actually did . but uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . well , sunlight preferably . user interface : w nah . industrial designer : uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you would n't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . user interface : mm . yeah . industrial designer : uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels , you could actually use uh you could use uh solar panels , but uh you ha you 'd have to implement them into uh the remote control , leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface . marketing : mm yeah . it 's too less space . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so uh so i i it it wo what 's actually i i c just in f i 've figured it out that well , uh seeing that you 'll always be uh within the l uh distance of tv , and the from tv there comes a a a whole bunch of light . so it would actually power itself uh from a tv . marketing : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but , well you just take up all the space , and you would n't uh have the full amount of power actually used . user interface : okay . project manager : but you prefer kinetic ? industrial designer : so i i prefer kinetic because it 's uh well , the costs are n't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . project manager : okay . yeah , but you do n't move a a remote control too much . industrial designer : i mean , if no , but uh d well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y well , you project manager : and that 's enough to to keep the energy level uh industrial designer : yeah , well uh actually it is . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and it it if it is n't , you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again . marketing : project manager : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but , what l what jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you 'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . and for rest , you 'd just add juice on the battery . project manager : okay . marketing : and when the battery does n't work , i usually shake it too . so project manager : thank you , tim . user interface : industrial designer : exactly . marketing : like slamming on it . it 's exactly the same . industrial designer : and so that uh uh well , user interface : industrial designer : f furthermore , you you we uh checked uh the cases . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : we have uh different options uh concerning the cases . you ha i you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh i figured that 's a bit boring . so you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . um , single curve , it 's just a well , uh , you know , it 's just uh a nice curve . or but but you could go in a in an double curves . and that 's like several different dimensions . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : that gives you an whole new uh effec project manager : dynamic dynamic look ? industrial designer : yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , i f i figured . but , that uh we 'll discuss later . marketing : but , are you going to draw it ? industrial designer : what ? user interface : th th yeah . yeah . industrial designer : you want me to draw in three-d_ ? marketing : the yeah . yeah . project manager : marketing : uh , i c i ca n't imagine . industrial designer : uh , yeah , i ca i ca i could i could show you . i could show you . marketing : i ca n't imagine how how how it looks like . user interface : industrial designer : well uh let 's say y uh you uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : let 's say that 's your standard uh marketing : design . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : that 's a bit your d standard design . but you could actually go like uh something like this . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and then uh in three-d_ effect you could go user interface : um marketing : uh project manager : industrial designer : so y you you just yeah , this is a this bit uh difficulty in marketing : user interface : industrial designer : i did n't take a major in art . so but but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth , you could you could uh just play around a bit with . marketing : oh , okay . okay . industrial designer : you you do n't have to use standard uh marketing : oh , okay . project manager : a little artistic . industrial designer : yeah you could y it leaves more space for creativity . project manager : okay . industrial designer : uh that might be an idea , marketing : okay . industrial designer : but just a well , furthermore , uh well , uh plastic versus rubber ? you we could choose uh what uh what 's better , plastic um or rubber . i i ch prefer rubber because it feels uh yeah . project manager : it 's soft . industrial designer : yeah , it 's soft and it 's that i like soft . project manager : that 's the material the younger people want uh , ai n't it ? user interface : industrial designer : yeah , yeah i mean uh plastic uh is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic uh your your i usually associate plastic with uh something that 's cheap . uh that 's maybe just me , but uh , we could uh uh , oh , talk about it later . uh furthermore , buttons . uh traditional uh or a touch screen . well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so i figured i 'll just leave it at the lcd . and uh chip set , well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go uh with a simple chip set . but uh if we decide to go on a n uh um lcd screen , we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set . and that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it . so that 's something we th have to keep in mind . if it is n't uh manageable uh budget-wise , we 'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons . marketing : well , i think uh we 're going to sell tell ten millions of them . so uh i bet a big company in uh korea or taiwan , like uh samsung , can give us uh a big discount on the chips , so industrial designer : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , probably . marketing : u usually , chips are uh are n't more expensive than one dollar . industrial designer : yeah , probably , but but uh yeah , that 's that 's marketing : so that that should n't be a real issue , i think . industrial designer : that should n't should n't be uh that big a issue . i 'll i 'll i 'll just add , uh uh i put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . uh what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ? marketing : user interface : um , i think you should use kinetic as a back-up . industrial designer : yeah , you you you should we should marketing : yeah , a combination . user interface : a combination , yeah . industrial designer : a combination . uh , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . when you pick it up , it charges up . marketing : yeah . like an uh aku uh industrial designer : yeah . marketing : acu uh , yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah , i know . user interface : okay . yeah . project manager : just like the watch from seiko . marketing : well , . yeah . user interface : psycho-kinetic . yeah . industrial designer : yeah , i con exactly . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : what uh what do you think ? project manager : i i uh i would prefer uh both uh too . industrial designer : you agree ? project manager : yeah . combine them . industrial designer : yeah ? both ? marketing : combine them . industrial designer : okay . uh , well that would bring the m m some more costs , but i mean the marketing : okay . industrial designer : who cares , right . project manager : industrial designer : that 's the project manager 's problem . user interface : buy a fifty cents battery and uh marketing : of course . fifty cent . project manager : industrial designer : yeah , well fifty cent uh user interface : industrial designer : uh , why does n't and then we have single-curved versus double-curved . user interface : well maybe i have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that . industrial designer : that okay . no , we 'll we 'll just wait and uh uh , plastic versus rubber . any ideas ? marketing : rubber . project manager : rubber . yeah . industrial designer : uh , rubber ? user interface : um , is n't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you 've got a . industrial designer : you user interface : or do you think it industrial designer : uh , i figured it will be m rather than hard user interface : rubber casing , yeah . industrial designer : nah , rubber c uh this is a casing , yeah . rubber casing , marketing : rather hard . industrial designer : because well if you use an uh d a touch-screen , uh it 's just a casing uh around it . so um , you could go for plastic , but i figured user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : um , well d maybe i can ask it right now the question that i have . industrial designer : i i i would choose rubber . user interface : uh , is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? it is n't , i think , yeah ? industrial designer : well , m i do n't know . no . marketing : well , i think that touch-screens are generally square . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but it 's the case you put around it that makes the shape . user interface : we 're we put fashion in electronics , industrial designer : that is n't user interface : so maybe we can uh marketing : hmm ? yeah okay , but if you have a square uh lcd screen , and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the lcd screen . user interface : mm yeah . industrial designer : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , that would cover it . marketing : that industrial designer : that that would solve the problem . user interface : oh , yeah . okay , i i get it . marketing : that 's it 's custom customisable and project manager : mm yeah . industrial designer : so mm uh uh so uh so what are the opinions ? uh rubber or plastic ? i i i prefer rubber . marketing : yeah , me too . project manager : me too . user interface : okay . project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : yeah , you too ? user interface : that 's good . industrial designer : you sure ? you you you seemed to hesitate a bit . user interface : well , as long a as long as it 's it 's uh it 's firm , and you do n't uh it 's not bendable or something , project manager : marketing : mm yeah . user interface : i th i think that goes too far . industrial designer : yeah , it it should n't it should n't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh project manager : okay . user interface : oh . industrial designer : no , that that that that 's gon na the the chip set will hold it firm in place , marketing : user interface : okay . industrial designer : and uh and and uh and a lcd screen also user interface : it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . industrial designer : yeah it m might it might . project manager : user interface : okay . marketing : industrial designer : uh , tra uh traditional versus lcd , well i figured we we all set on that . marketing : industrial designer : and uh , then also the simple versus advanced . well i figure if we go for l_ lcd , we we should have the advanced . project manager : mm yeah . industrial designer : so that should n't be a problem . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : okay , well that 's my uh project manager : thank you . industrial designer : uh , you 're welcome . marketing : can i uh do my thing ? project manager : yeah . do your thing , tim . marketing : it uh user interface : do your thing . industrial designer : project manager : bring it on . marketing : expert map . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : okay uh last week project manager : marketing : i went to uh paris and milan for some trend-watching . industrial designer : marketing : for marketing . our research and development department and i went to paris and milan . in paris and milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um what they like in design uh and material nowadays . findings . our main audience , uh so that 's people below forty , uh prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . project manager : marketing : very basic colours , like janus explained . um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow . project manager : marketing : um , considering material , um yeah . they like spongy material , industrial designer : user interface : spongeball . marketing : like yeah a sponge-ball . user interface : marketing : like a s soft material . project manager : yeah . marketing : janus m uh mentioned it also . i think he did some uh some findings himself . industrial designer : well , the teletubbies sh project manager : marketing : you wer you were n't in paris ? okay . like this . like big uh g flashy colours . fresh . project manager : flashy . yeah . marketing : it 's nice , i think . okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . uh yeah , uh materials like wood that project manager : yeah , but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of . industrial designer : well , you could . you you could . marketing : no n j just j just a w project manager : yeah but never seen one . user interface : it 'll float . marketing : no , okay , but just just a wooden uh look . project manager : case . oh , a wooden look , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor . user interface : tables . project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : the that is n't wood anyway , but okay ? but , that 's our secondary audience . project manager : yeah . marketing : so , uh we decided to take mm yeah the people below forty . project manager : yeah . marketing : so , that this does n't apply . 'kay , the third . uh , there 're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . they have to look fancy . um , they should be technological in innovative . that means uh there have to be fancy things in . uh , and easy to use . but that 's common . my personal preferences . we have to aim at a mu at the main audience . and uh , therefore use fresh colours . project manager : would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or marketing : uh , i 'll i 'll come to that in a second point . project manager : okay . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : like the nokia uh the removable covers , uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . project manager : yeah . okay . marketing : uh , a third , material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber . um , two advantages . uh , it fits within the current market trends . and uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it . so uh to come back to your question , i think uh and the people in milan and paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard . like uh seen on regular mobile phones . actually , they have a lot in common . the phones and the project manager : industrial designer : well , i actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so yeah . marketing : yeah . yeah . okay . project manager : maybe you could use your remote as a phone . user interface : hey . project manager : there are numbers on it , so uh industrial designer : that might be a next step . marketing : yeah , exactly . project manager : marketing : uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition . user interface : marketing : uh , it 's very innovative . innovative . project manager : so that you say um s_p_s_s_ , and it goes to uh marketing : yeah , like something . project manager : okay . marketing : you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak uh speech recognition and stuff . but , we have to keep the cost in uh in mind , but it user interface : twelve fifty uh marketing : yeah , it it can be uh very expensive . project manager : marketing : 'kay , second . project manager : marketing : uh , building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . industrial designer : marketing : uh , also the link with uh mobile phones . uh project manager : yeah , but you do n't use that th games when you watching television , i think . industrial designer : well , yeah . marketing : no , but no , okay . but you do n't use games when you 're d when you 're making a telephone call . it 's just the same . user interface : when your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . project manager : marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , okay . marketing : when you 're at college . project manager : you take your remote control with you . user interface : take it . industrial designer : you take your uh remote with you to school . marketing : uh no . you al you also take uh t industrial designer : yeah . marketing : you take your ipac and go uh play games . yeah . yeah . well , i do that , but okay , and um project manager : industrial designer : marketing : and third , i stick with it , the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . user interface : ooh . s industrial designer : very nice . marketing : that 's it . project manager : uh great . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : marketing : project manager : user interface : in okay . um the interface contents . well that 's a just simple powerpoint mock-up i want to m make it more as dynamic for you so i 'll draw there . but , the main concept is um take one big touch screen . um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space . and uh make the menu structure changeable . so if you press um system , that 's marketing : user interface : yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in . or maybe even a step further when you want to um t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . and um other buttons can may be displayed here if that 's necessary . and um well , how do uh do we want to look at uh uh f um yeah does a remote look well , it 's you 've got ta hold it in one hand . so um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . and some remotes you can use with your thumb . but i think that 's too difficult for this one . so you can make it s a little broader . yeah . and here ? and maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons . and use your other hands on the menu structure . so here are gon na be the program buttons . one , two , three , four , et cetera . and the the volume control and program control maybe . and , down here , um , i added , this could be one uh big lcd . um , the menu structure . so you can use it in uh in this way . um one thing you 've got ta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . project manager : user interface : um , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , um and well , i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . but if you 're programming the colour of the tv , do not display twenty other options that are possible . just keep it as simple as uh as possible . and do not use too many levels . do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and um push plus twenty times . project manager : user interface : but just the um uh just in one button if possible . and um , well , you kn you all know the tv levels . um , channel one , two . and when you get to n to uh to ten , ye and want to go back , uh well you have a problem . just m most most modern tvs , you you press one zero , and it goes to ten . and else , to one and through after that . so the s a button less . and um , things like teletext , put them in the menu . things like um um yeah . marketing : yeah . uh , what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button ? project manager : user interface : yeah , yeah w yeah , i i find i must trying to uh tell it . marketing : l like in uh internet explorer . user interface : is uh volume plus and minus ? and this is program uh plus and minus . uh marketing : yeah okay , but does it that is for uh going from four to five . but if you go from two to eight , and you want user interface : or if you 're watching studio sports on uh on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two marketing : yeah , and on two . that you can switch switch easy . user interface : well yes , i think that 's a good idea . but um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . marketing : yeah it is . yeah . user interface : and if you 're using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . you just do n't have to play games uh in-between . but if you 're really switching between two channels , you wo n't have time uh to d use the other options . marketing : mm no . user interface : um , yeah already already told that . marketing : that 's it . user interface : yeah . that 's my conclusion . project manager : oh , okay ."
