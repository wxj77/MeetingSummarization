    "answer": "project manager : okay . so , now more design . user interface : right . thank you . mine 's not quite as complicated as all that . project manager : that 's what we like to hear . user interface : did i press function ? yeah . project manager : is it control function ei oh , th there you go . user interface : oh . um . okay so i 'm gon na talk a bit about the technical functions design . i 'm louisa , the user interface designer , as you know . um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . um here are two example remotes . um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so i think they incorporate a kind of video function which we wo n't have to worry about . uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . um so my personal preference would be the right remote . so , it 's got nice big buttons , it 's got a very limited number of buttons . um they 're nice , kinda clearly labelled . um i like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . so it 's very very user friendly , and it 's got a little splash of colour . could maybe do with some more colour . um . project manager : well there 's a couple of things there . um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . so basically we 'd have to uh we 'd have to be putting that on um the the product . user interface : hmm . do we get to see that ? project manager : i have n't as yet , no . user interface : will you be presenting that in a bit ? project manager : but uh i got uh i got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . so uh i 'm guessing that uh uh i notice on the bottom there it 's got uh what 's that ? a_p_o_g_e_e_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour i can see in that is the red . industrial designer : would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . so we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . possibly ? user interface : what do you mean by the circular section ? industrial designer : j yeah yeah yeah j yeah user interface : like all of that bottom bit ? project manager : industrial designer : just this little bit is that i think that 's still um a video remote part , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so maybe we could get rid of that as well . user interface : yeah . and i do n't really think that you need nine numbers . project manager : well b uh w user interface : i mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? i think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . project manager : well th the on the user interface : like how often do you hit nine ? project manager : well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and we 'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . but but industrial designer : it 's just people are used to seeing that , so if we did n't have them then they might think it 's project manager : but , well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but uh i mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? i would have thought that uh it 's forever expanding and at the moment we 've got although you 've onl you 've got the five standard , you 've got the b_b_c_ have come up with a further six industrial designer : project manager : and uh there 's uh i do n't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh sky and various other um various others . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so i would 've thought that we would n't , you know , rather okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it 'll take a second user interface : project manager : 'cause you have to be able to stop it . maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . y you 'd want you 'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted . industrial designer : user interface : um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that 's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah , i s i suppose in a sense you could have um if you 've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and that would cut down your time . user interface : mm . um . project manager : anyway . user interface : but i think a lot of um like cable and sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you 'd have another remote for all of those channels . industrial designer : okay , yeah . user interface : like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers project manager : whatever . user interface : yeah . marketing : project manager : okay . okay . limit the number of buttons , user friendly . user interface : but i suppose nine 's not really excessive . industrial designer : i suppose with nine you 've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it 's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . user interface : i suppose it does make a good pattern . industrial designer : so with that we 'd kind of by-pass any problems with project manager : yeah well that 's true , yeah , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that that makes sense . industrial designer : yeah . 'cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need . project manager : yeah . does . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so w so what was the circular thing that you were user interface : okay . um i think that 's just for a video , so we would n't need any of that at all . industrial designer : so we could get it down to what ? project manager : if it 's just for tv , which is what it is at the moment . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so we get to how many buttons have we got ? we 've just got ten , eleven twelve th we got fourteen that we need . i guess . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um which is n't really too many . that 'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote . project manager : mm-hmm . well we 've we 've got um that it 's remote for tv only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . industrial designer : 'kay . project manager : i 'm i do n't know d did you have that information behind the marketing , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : or was i meant to give you that information ? marketing : um i 'm not sure . i had i 've had some market information , project manager : right . marketing : but not from the company , no . project manager : right , okay , so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery . industrial designer : 'kay . project manager : we 've only got about another four hours left . user interface : marketing : user interface : okay , so is everyone happy with that ? industrial designer : ah yes yes , that seems good . marketing : okay ."
