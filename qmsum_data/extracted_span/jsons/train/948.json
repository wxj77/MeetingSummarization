    "query": "<s> what was the current situation about hefcw 's powers of intervention ?",
    "answer": "dawn bowden am : i think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome . they explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator , and they 've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed . how can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers ? kirsty williams am : well , looking ahead to the new bill , i would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise . those powers , for instance , could include the ability to offer advice and guidance , rather than , maybe , punitive interventions , and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions . so , i would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene , from the soft , flexible type , which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions , through to something that would be , as i said , more punitive , if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure . hefin david am : can i just come in there , on the point that was made ? the issue that seemed to me to come from hefcw and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps . so , rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take , it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee ' to\u2014 kirsty williams am : that 's a very hefcw thing to say . hefin david am : \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt , and there do n't seem to be many steps in between that . i 'd invite you to say whether you 'd like to remedy that in future . kirsty williams am : i think , as i said at the beginning of the session , this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful , because we can reflect on that feedback . as i said , i would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to , as i said , issue , perhaps , advice and guidance to an institution , so there would be a more graduated escalation . huw , is there anything else that i 've missed out ?"
