    "answer": "project manager : okay . hi team . hope you had a good lunch . okay we 're back for the conceptual design meeting . um let 's get started . 'kay , here is the agenda for today 's meeting . um we 're gon na open it and i 'm gon na keep the minutes as project manager . we 're gon na have three presentations , one from each of you again . and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we 're gon na close it up . and we have forty minutes again . 'kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . okay . let 's go ahead and start off with your presentations . who would like to go first ? industrial designer : just trying to move mine right now . project manager : okay . um courtney would you mind starting us off ? marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . trend watching ? 'kay . marketing : yeah . okay , so trend watching . uh since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . so i guess we can go ahead and go to the next . so what they want . right now customers want fancy versus functional . um basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . so the customer basically is confused . they do n't know exactly what they want . they want us to tell them . industrial designer : they want everything , but simply . marketing : yes . exactly . industrial designer : okay . marketing : so we can go to next . project manager : mm 'kay . marketing : okay . so in milan and paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : so i do n't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . i do n't know really , i mean i guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to project manager : mm . mm . marketing : rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you 'd want like a softer touch . i mean do you guys know what i mean . project manager : right . yes . industrial designer : yeah th marketing : yeah . um . but as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , i do n't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend , project manager : right . marketing : and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months , project manager : right . people do n't buy a new remote every so often . industrial designer : i i can marketing : because yeah . i mean that could just be a spring thing right now . industrial designer : i can address some of that issue , i think , with uh my presentation . marketing : okay . awesome . project manager : okay . marketing : um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , i mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . uh we need the real reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . that 's one of our key goals , we wan na promote our product . and i was thinking about different types of designs and i came up with something . actually right here . so what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we 'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , i mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . 'cause then it 'll appeal to older generation and like said retro 's cool . so it 's classically retro . so i mean that 's just an idea if you guys like it . project manager : very good . i like it . okay , ready for the next slide ? marketing : and , yep . and that 's it . project manager : op mm 'kay . industrial designer : okay . project manager : great . great presentation . ready ? user interface : okay hang on . project manager : 'kay . user interface : see if it 's there . project manager : which one is it ? user interface : i do n't know . hang on . interface concepts , no ? project manager : interface concepts new . user interface : either refresh it , or it sh oh wait , maybe i did n't put it there . hang on . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : mine will always read copy of something or other . project manager : sorry ? industrial designer : i i copied mine before i sent it over . project manager : oh okay . user interface : sorry , hang on . do n't know . project manager : oh there we go . user interface : okay . okay , um looking at the interface concept , it 's gon na be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . uh if you wan na start the next slide . project manager : sure . user interface : um uh ca n't really see , but there 's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . and then also there 's the idea of the base . that 's sort of like an idea there . and then on the right , we have what 's really big trend right now , it 's the ipod . it 's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , and it 's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced . so if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it , but anyway , next . project manager : mm 'kay . user interface : um there 's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . you 'd you know you 're in the dark , you do n't wan na be looking at the remote control . and the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it 's a v_ , and so yo you 're kind of feeling a v_ like volume up . what it really is is a v_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow . and so it 's like a sort of a criticism you 'd probably turn that o the other way up . um but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy , um sort of old-fashioned in a way . either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you 're looking at the up and down arrow . and then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that 's the second one down , that sort of thing . so it 's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . um this is particularly geared towards children . marketing : that 's cute . user interface : um it 's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . um and you have the shapes and it 's very simplistic and friendly looking . um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch , so it 's like they ch watch , you know , the c_ beebies or something like that , project manager : user interface : uh keep them away from other channels . so that 's like another ar um , project manager : okay . user interface : i mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . you have the wider section for the main controls there . uh you could see how many buttons there are . and then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . on the bottom we probably would n't need that , because it 's more for like a d_v_d_ function which we are not gon na be using . um . so again it 's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that 's where you could put the r_r_ , real reaction . project manager : 'kay . user interface : and then finally these are like the sort of same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . none of them i 'm particularly keen on by the way . marketing : yeah . user interface : but it 's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we 'd like the the button size on this . project manager : mm . or i like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever . marketing : user interface : right . marketing : i have four of those remotes . project manager : good lord . user interface : marketing : project manager : okay . ready ? oh , yeah . okay . user interface : that 's it . project manager : great job . industrial designer : okay , my turn . project manager : okay . marketing : okay . industrial designer : whoo . project manager : what 's the title ? industrial designer : it 'll be copy of component design . project manager : got it . industrial designer : yeah . th that looks like it . 'kay . so basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . so you press the button , it produces uh a signal that 's encoded specifically for that button . transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the tv 's centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . so that being said next slide , please . findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . an l_e_d_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we 've actually determined we want . next slide , please . thank you . uh personal preferences , uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , l_e_d_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . next slide , please . um just talking to the um manufacturing division . they suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power . um i 'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that . so next slide , please . project manager : interesting . industrial designer : suggested casing options . okay . we can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer . options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . i do n't think anyone 's gon na go for a wood one , because splinters marketing : that would be amazing , though , yeah . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : no , splinters would industrial designer : um certain restrictions do apply here though . uh latex , you ca n't do solar power with a latex one . so , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they ca n't have the solar powered option . double-curved , you ca n't do titanium . marketing : what is that ? industrial designer : um that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . now if you wanted that , you ca n't do titanium . and uh so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . user interface : right . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : i think i have one more slide . project manager : no , okay . industrial designer : no , i did n't . um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they 've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . so depends on what we decide we wan na do . in addition to that if we 're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we 're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . so we 'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . but that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes . marketing : right . okay . project manager : okay . alright , industrial designer : and that 's all i got . project manager : well thank you for those informative presentations . let 's go back to um now we have to make some decisions . where were we ? user interface : let me just add one more thing that i could n't say before , project manager : sure . user interface : and that 's just that there 's the new technology that they 've developed on the voice recognition . um . marketing : oh this the thing we were talking about earlier . user interface : right except that it 's sort of odd , and i 'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , um there 's a sample sensor and there 's a sample speaker unit for so , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , jill , project manager : user interface : but i 'm not sure exactly how it 's gon na work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions . so does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and ca n't change it in order for it to be recognised , or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this . project manager : right . right . marketing : yeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . user interface : right , marketing : so that way the remote reads it . user interface : so it 's got like a limited memory and programme it . so it 's sort of iffy , but that 's kind of what you 'd say . marketing : i feel like voice recognition would be , i do n't know , w it would be too hard to really project manager : hmm . programme . marketing : i mean we could do it , but project manager : if it 's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology industrial designer : well , we are making the chip . marketing : technology . industrial designer : so , i mean but , i guess , we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . marketing : and it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like industrial designer : yeah . marketing : the , i mean just like the more advanced it is , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : the better it 'll sell . industrial designer : i i thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know i think we 'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . so that we could reduce cost . marketing : yeah , 'cause we need to know how big it 's gon na be and how heavy . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay , that kind of brings us to this , let 's let 's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . um . industrial designer : okay . project manager : do we wan na go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ? marketing : oh the base , yeah . project manager : the base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ? industrial designer : i think the p user interface : i always feel like first i wan na know what it looks like , before 'cause if it 's something really really small , then it 's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up project manager : yeah , and we do n't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the tv . it 's not gon na be a huge universal remote . user interface : right . marketing : we need to decide , well so we can figure how big it 's gon na be , like exactly what buttons we want project manager : what size battery and user interface : well , the other thing is like even if it 's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , marketing : and exactly it could be like this . yes . user interface : 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that 's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . marketing : i 'd , well uh this one is really comfortable , like i like the sides whatever , user interface : are you gon na lose it easier ? marketing : because but if we have the um , the locator , then we do n't have to worry about that . industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : so we can make it small if we have a l locating device . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : if we do a voice-activated locator , though , we 're gon na be looking at a more substantial chip . so user interface : so i that 's the other thing , it 's like you know are we gon na have certain chips that are gon na require bigger size period ? marketing : two double a_s , for this size . user interface : but like , you know , if we get more complicated then it 's gon na v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . marketing : right . industrial designer : honestly , i think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small , compact project manager : right . i agree , it 's either gon na be bigger with a base or smaller with just marketing : yeah . user interface : so we sh marketing : smaller , without project manager : a battery like this guy . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : mm yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? you wan na vote ? marketing : i think if we had a a locating device with the small one , i think that seems way more advanced . project manager : i 'm kind of i 'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i 'm a away from the base . project manager : bigger and the base . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : that just seems so clunky and industrial designer : 'kay so marketing : yeah , because i mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , user interface : smaller and smaller , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : yeah industrial designer : the only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash . user interface : you 're kidding . marketing : oh . project manager : industrial designer : you know it happens . user interface : industrial designer : i 've had three watches go that way too . marketing : yeah . project manager : user interface : oh watches i 've but i 've never washed a cell phone . marketing : ouch . a phone , whoa , that would wow , that would hurt . project manager : okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ? industrial designer : pieces everywhere . well , we have lots of options . i do n't think wood is a viable option . marketing : yeah wood . project manager : no . oh what did you user interface : well , titanium s project manager : oh sorry , go ahead . user interface : i was saying that titanium , if we 're being restricted then i would probably lean away from that . marketing : yeah , 'cause if it 's gon na cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive . project manager : right . industrial designer : however , project manager : what would you recommend ? industrial designer : well , we only wan na sell it for twenty five euro marketing : yeah . industrial designer : right ? 'cause i was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , user interface : yeah . that 'll yeah , exactly . industrial designer : make them a rarity so to speak . user interface : the selling point , yeah . marketing : we could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if industrial designer : yeah . user interface : are we restricted by this ? project manager : i i think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.i 'm industrial designer : well the original user interface : twenty five euros project manager : not sure that we 'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of industrial designer : okay . project manager : remotes . if this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , i think . industrial designer : yeah . good plan . marketing : good plan . project manager : okay , so we wan na go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ? industrial designer : honestly i 'd recommend like um uh since we 're going with batteries instead of solar power , i 'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex , because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : we could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so , because this year is all fruit , god only knows why , user interface : marketing : yeah , who knows . industrial designer : um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know project manager : okay . user interface : so you 're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it 's all gon na be cherry-coloured or is it gon na be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ? marketing : o or we could like take off this . project manager : they could buy cases , maybe , industrial designer : they could come back . and buy the extra case . project manager : if they wanted . user interface : okay . project manager : i think it 's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options . industrial designer : so we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start . marketing : yeah . user interface : the what the top face , right ? marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . okay . marketing : yeah , because the soft latex definitely is squishy . that 's in . well i mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic . project manager : right . right . okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ? industrial designer : how complicated are we gon na go with the voice activated user interface : yeah . project manager : i do n't think we should do voice , i think we should just do um the recognition for when it 's lost , you know . could we user interface : a tracker , yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : 'cause that uh what it type of , yeah , for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like , because people could just be talking and we do n't want it going off all the time . project manager : right . industrial designer : well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing . marketing : so uh ooh . project manager : marketing : uh see i 'm uh i 'm strangely attracted to it , because i know that 's it 's definitely gon na be big , because it 's , i do n't know , it 's just so high-tech . user interface : well , my little sister got for christmas she got one of those key finders that 's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . industrial designer : yeah , see that would just irritate me . user interface : and then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you could n't turn it off . project manager : oh dear . user interface : so it became highly irritating . marketing : then maybe voice project manager : okay . industrial designer : so i think having a key-phrase is much better . marketing : maybe voice activation wo n't be good . project manager : okay . alright . but it 's not gon na be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , right ? marketing : yeah , n n no , we just want it to be a finder . project manager : just a user interface : but then it project manager : okay , alright . user interface : hmm . okay . marketing : but do can your can the department make industrial designer : that would be like a mid-class um yeah . marketing : oh , brilliant then . industrial designer : so we do n't actually have to go for well , if they 've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it 's a brand new chip . why not introduce it in this way ? project manager : mm 'kay . marketing : yeah , good point . project manager : uh and what size batteries , double a_ , triple a_ ? marketing : i think triple a_ , it 'll be lighter . project manager : two ? could it run off of two marketing : i mean more more come in a package . user interface : well , that depends on what the energy is needed . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think , well , we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? so they 're more widely available now . and they also have a longer battery life than most batteries . project manager : they 're more expensive though , too . industrial designer : but if you only have to replace it every five years . project manager : mm . thoughts anybody ? marketing : that 's a good point . user interface : as long as we sell it with it . industrial designer : well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it , user interface : right , that 's what i meant . industrial designer : 'cause i 'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk . marketing : we could think about it and come back to it next meeting . project manager : okay . yeah . alright . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : we still have one more meeting . project manager : okay . so we 've covered that first category , user interface concept , meaning design . user interface : what 's it gon na yeah , what 's it gon na look like . project manager : okay . i ki i kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? it might be the four way scroll , too . i mean if marketing : yeah , it could be whatever , project manager : yeah . marketing : as long as there 's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there 's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle . project manager : yeah . mm-hmm . user interface : well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gon na get wider than your your hands are , marketing : oh , that 's true . user interface : because w and then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? marketing : good point . industrial designer : in the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : which i think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , user interface : yeah . project manager : oh , i see what you mean . industrial designer : that could be particularly useful . project manager : i think so . marketing : so scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? project manager : yeah , i like that . 'kay . marketing : but we definitely if we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled . yeah , industrial designer : well , if it 's just up and down marketing : like on the side of it . oh if it 's just up and down . user interface : but is that for industrial designer : volume or channel . user interface : which ? industrial designer : i do n't know . marketing : well , you could do some on both sides . user interface : do we have both sides ? project manager : can we ? industrial designer : mm yeah . we should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , project manager : so that you 're just not holding it and it changes the chan marketing : yeah . industrial designer : 'cause oth otherwise you 're not just holding it and going like this , you know . marketing : that 's squishy . that 's squishy . user interface : well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . marketing : have buttons . project manager : mm . yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : yeah , that . project manager : hmm . 'kay any other ideas ? user interface : um what colour ? project manager : oh , yeah . latex covers . w industrial designer : we have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we 'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo 's available . user interface : well i sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the r_r_ like that . and that 's at the bottom of it . marketing : yeah . project manager : i think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , user interface : which button ? project manager : i do n't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button , i do n't know , but you know if we 're gon na put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one . are they all gon na have our company logo on them ? every cover ? industrial designer : yeah , i do n't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so i think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea . project manager : if we want it to be visible and um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? but those are plastic , right ? user interface : yeah . project manager : they 're not titanium . user interface : yeah . project manager : i kind of like that look . uh but , or if it was really industrial designer : for our base one ? project manager : yeah , for the base or if we 're going for the retro look , i think , like a really shiny black would be cool . marketing : yeah , project manager : what are your thoughts ? marketing : or like a gun-metal grey , project manager : gun-metal gray . marketing : 'cause then it combines the silver and the black . project manager : there you go , gun-metal gray . user interface : i 'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button . industrial designer : it 'll wear off . user interface : what 's the button marketing : yeah , buttons wear off . user interface : well , w w then what 's the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ? i guess . just looking at examples , y you just do n't ever see the logo on a button , it 's always on the actual casing . project manager : right . industrial designer : there 's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual user interface : project manager : on the back ? user interface : but you do n't marketing : but we want it to be seen . project manager : it d visible user interface : but uh , yeah , you do n't see it . project manager : visibility though marketing : we need it to be seen . project manager : 'cause if it was only on the back really the only time you 're gon na see it is when you drop it or when you 're changing the battery . user interface : well , hang on . the other option is , i do n't know if you can see it but it 's like if project manager : i can find it again . user interface : yeah , it 's like the second to last slide . project manager : okay . and yours was called interface concept ? user interface : interface , yeah . project manager : this one ? user interface : yeah . um . project manager : well , for some reason i ca n't get it to just go to that slide directly . user interface : okay , it 's the very right one . you see at the bottom , it 's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it 's like the top . it does n't necessarily replace the entire top . and so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in . project manager : okay , yes user interface : if c you envisioning it ? and so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that 's the bit that changes . project manager : okay . industrial designer : the only problem is we 're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , so i was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . user interface : yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : like a little cut-out kind of industrial designer : yeah . user interface : right . project manager : okay . user interface : that 's like , you know , a a cellphone it 's like the the screen is always just left opened . marketing : right . user interface : and so , what we are gon na do it like bright yellow with the r_r_ ? marketing : yeah . project manager : anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ? marketing : some of tho well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . well , kind of . um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . user interface : yellow . project manager : yellow , i like that idea . user interface : yeah . marketing : like if we like the one all the way on the left , uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . so we 'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons . user interface : oh , that one . project manager : i like the yellow illumination idea , very good . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . any other ideas or thoughts ? we all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wan na do with this project so user interface : um . ha hang on let me catch up . marketing : mm yeah . project manager : 'kay . user interface : did we finalise what buttons we 're including or we just everything that we said before ? project manager : i think there will be time for that later . i 'm guessing . 'kay , well we 're gon na wrap this up . um next meeting is gon na start in thirty minutes , and here 's what we 're each of us going to do . the i_d_ is going to do the look and feel design , the u_i_d_ the user interface design . i think you 're going to get a lot of , i mean , the final say on what buttons get put we 'll all talk about it , but i think , that 's pretty much what you 're gon na do , right ? user interface : yeah . project manager : i guess . 'kay . and you 're gon na do some product evaluation . okay , and right now , the i_d_ and u_i_d_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . yeah . industrial designer : great . play doh . user interface : fun . project manager : okay , and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . alright . well , thank you for a very productive meeting ."
