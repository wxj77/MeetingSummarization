    "answer": "project manager : so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . um so here is the agenda for today . uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . and we 'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . then we 'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh euro . okay . so let 's go . uh if i go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . so we went through th uh w we took this following decisions . no lcd , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . we went through the use of wheels and but buttons . and also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . okay . um . good . so guys let this uh wonderful thing . industrial designer : okay so we can go to the slides . project manager : oh yeah . sorry . um . industrial designer : yeah . number three . oh number two sorry . project manager : which is industrial designer : so final design . final design . okay so michael you can go ahead . user interface : yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow well to make a banana project manager : yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe . user interface : remote okay so we actually have a industrial designer : you can pull it out first , maybe . user interface : we 've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it 's not gon na tip over and um this is the remote itself , it 's kind of it 's it 's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . we 've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally . project manager : what 's the use uh of the t turbo button already ? user interface : this is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th project manager : ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops . user interface : yeah . well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . but normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture . industrial designer : uh project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : and we we do have one more functionality . if you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the tv . user interface : the tv yeah . project manager : which one ? user interface : the s the turbo button . industrial designer : the turbo button . project manager : okay . user interface : so rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button . industrial designer : additional button . marketing : what this button for ? user interface : this is a teletext button . so once you press that then you get teletext marketing : okay . user interface : and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh project manager : to navigate it through th through teletext . user interface : to navigate yeah . marketing : but if you want to go to page seven hundred ? industrial designer : that 's right , that 's right . user interface : yeah . project manager : with the wheel it 's easy . marketing : how man user interface : well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing , you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh marketing : i do n't understand it . can you repeat it ? user interface : well you can you can press press the teletext button industrial designer : user interface : and then you then you can you can f industrial designer : so then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and you can tele marketing : ah okay okay . okay . okay okay . industrial designer : yeah , user interface : mm uh industrial designer : once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume . marketing : okay . i see . i see . okay . okay . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and this is the uh the infrared uh port . industrial designer : that 's right . user interface : also the top of the banana . project manager : excellent . user interface : so . and then we have industrial designer : yeah . user interface : in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana . project manager : calling . excellent . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ? user interface : actually they do . that 's that 's yeah that 's uh that 's form and function in the one in the one uh object . industrial designer : yeah . so it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage . user interface : industrial designer : it 's like antennas . user interface : yeah . so . but yeah that 's um that 's just like that 's an attractive um base station . project manager : great . user interface : so . project manager : so , what else ? user interface : okay . industrial designer : and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries . marketing : is it really weight ? is it light or industrial designer : it is very light . project manager : yeah , they 're light . user interface : it 's it 's uh it 's about the weight of a banana . marketing : okay . project manager : marketing : okay . user interface : you know , to give you the correct look and feel . industrial designer : yeah . and we have put these different colours so that people do n't mistake them mistake it as a banana . user interface : industrial designer : otherwise it 's you know a child comes and so marketing : okay . yeah yeah yeah , i see . i under i understand . user interface : i think a child would try to eat it anyway , so maybe we should industrial designer : yeah . user interface : consider that . maybe health and safety aspects . project manager : ah yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . oh we did n't think of that yet . yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : so for the power source , apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries . industrial designer : oh yeah that 's right . project manager : uh you mean okay . so user interface : i do n't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station . project manager : yeah , where are going to where are you are you going to place them ? industrial designer : mm-hmm mm-hmm . it 'll it 'll be always at top somewhere at there . user interface : if i was gon na place them i 'd put them on the on the top here since that 's like uh the black bit project manager : you have enough surface ? you user interface : but yeah i do n't i really do n't think it 's necessary to have the solar cells anymore . industrial designer : yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries project manager : okay . industrial designer : so that that is . project manager : what will be the autonomy ? roughly ? user interface : the what sorry ? project manager : the autonomy . autonomy . user interface : what do you mean ? project manager : uh i mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ? marketing : how long the how long the bit the batteries long . user interface : ah . ah . a long time . project manager : yeah . a long user interface : no no no , industrial designer : eight to ten eight to ten hours . marketing : user interface : it can it should be weeks . industrial designer : n most no most of the time it 's not being used . project manager : yeah , so it 's user interface : yeah but y people do n't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wan na leave it on the couch so industrial designer : so when when you are making it on project manager : it 's used only when you industrial designer : mm . mm-hmm . no eight or eight or ten hours of working . user interface : ah , okay . industrial designer : if you are just leaving like that it 'll be much longer . user interface : okay . project manager : yeah . f weeks . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . that 's right . project manager : right . next slide ? industrial designer : yeah . and we are having the speakers regular chip for control . pricing is was a factor so that 's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . and uh that 's it . project manager : okay . okay . those really sounds very good . industrial designer : that 's right . project manager : nothing else to add ? user interface : it seems to be falling over . marketing : i l yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : i like i like it . maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons . looks a bit industrial designer : you want to have more functional buttons ? marketing : looks a bit puzzled uh i dunno how to say that . industrial designer : you are not convinced . marketing : you the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it 's teletext or not industrial designer : not not many , we we want to keep it simple . so that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons . marketing : and the volume button will will become industrial designer : it 's up to you , means . project manager : well in fact b both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext . industrial designer : now that means let 's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits . user interface : or can move between positions in the in the number . industrial designer : that 's right . project manager : yeah . marketing : and what about people who want to use digits ? butto real buttons ? industrial designer : yeah . so there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape . marketing : industrial designer : so we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they do n't care about the buttons any more . and anyway marketing : okay . because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ? user interface : it 's all automatic . marketing : it 's all automatic . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : marketing : okay . okay yeah it 's fine . project manager : very good uh yeah marketing : w we are living in a wonderful world . project manager : you th yeah . user interface : uh . industrial designer : project manager : bananas everywhere . industrial designer : project manager : okay , so marketing : automatically configure . project manager :"
