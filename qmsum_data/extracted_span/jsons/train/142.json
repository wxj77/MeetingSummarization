    "query": "<s> what did user interface recommend to do when discussing the functional design and why ?",
    "answer": "user interface : and it 's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it 's a common issue . um what we can do is , well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . right ? marketing : solar . project manager : yeah . user interface : and s for some people yeah . well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? marketing : but solar user interface : like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you 're not using it , so you 'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we 'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . you never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries . and also you can i i think it 's a good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole . you know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . marketing : blah , i like it . i like the idea , but we 're talking about in cost is gon na probably double . user interface : it w it would increase the cost . marketing : but boy , we can sell this thing , because there 's no batteries , it 's environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . user interface : and you could page the remote if you lose it . maybe there 's a button on the cradle . marketing : yep , that 's right . i really see project manager : now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ? marketing : but the cost i no no . no no , we have t we have to change the end cost . project manager : we we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ? marketing : there 's uh i mean i do n't see it anyway . yeah , that 's gon na be up to these guys . i my reaction is no , but user interface : what i can do is i can d look into ho well pedro and i can look into how much this might increase our our costs project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gon na have on our on our final numbers ."
