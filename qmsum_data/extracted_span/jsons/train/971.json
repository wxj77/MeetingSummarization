    "answer": "professor d : yeah , i be pretty good . phd i : we yeah . grad f : we 're about we 're about half halfway through our disk right now . phd b : yeah . phd i : that was one of our concerns . phd b : are we only half ? i thought we were more than that . grad f : we 're probably a little more than that because we 're using up some space that we should n't be on . so , once everything gets converted over to the disks we 're supposed to be using we 'll be probably , uh , seventy - five percent . phd b : well , when i was looking for space for thilo , i found one disk that had , uh , i think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen . and everything else was sorta committed . uh grad f : were those backed - up or non - backed - up ? phd b : those were non - backed - up . phd e : non - back - up . grad f : right . so that 's different . phd b : s oh , you 're talking about backed - up . grad f : i 'm much more concerned about the backed - up . the non - backed - up , phd b : i have n't looked to see how much of that we have . grad f : yeah , i is cheap . i mean , if we need to we can buy a disk , hang it off a s uh , workstation . if it 's not backed - up the sysadmins do n't care too much . professor d : yeah . so , i mean , pretty much anytime we need a disk , we can get it at the rate that we 're phd i : you can i should n't be saying this , but , you can just you know , since the back - ups are every night , you can recycle the backed - up diskspace . grad f : yeah . but that 's that 's that 's risky . professor d : yeah . you really should n't be saying grad f : mmm . mmm . phd i : i did n't say that . grad f : yeah , that 's right . phd i : i did n't say that . grad f : beep that out . professor d : da - we had allowed dave to listen to these these , uh , recordings . phd i : right . professor d : um yeah , i me and there 's been this conversation going on about getting another file server , and and we can do that . phd i : mm - hmm . professor d : we 'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of of disk , i guess . grad f : yeah . it 's really the back - up issue rather than the file server issue . phd i : well , i think { comment } i think there 's an argument for having you know , you could use our old file server for for disks that have data that is very rarely accessed , and then have a fast new file server for data that is , um , heavily accessed . grad f : yeah . my understanding is , the issue is n't really the file server . phd i : yeah . grad f : we could always put more disks on . phd i : yeah . it 's the back it 's the back - up capaci grad f : it 's the back - up system . phd i : yeah . grad f : so which is near saturation , apparently . so . phd b : i think i think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines . professor d : soon . phd b : and we 've got , you know , fifty machines trying to access data off of abbott at once . grad f : well , we 're alright for now because the network 's so slow . phd i : i mean , i think i think we 've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it , but the what about putting the stuff on , like , c - cd - rom or dvd or something ? grad f : yeah . that was me . i was the one who said it was not reliable . the - they they wear out . phd i : ok . oh , ok . grad f : yeah . the the th phd i : but they wear out just from sitting on the shelf ? grad f : yep . absolutely . phd i : or from being read and read ? grad f : no . read and write do n't hurt them too much unless you scratch them . phd i : oh , ok . grad f : but the r the write once , and the read - writes , do n't last . so you do n't wa you do n't wan na put ir un reproduceable data on them . phd i : uh - huh . phd b : wear out after what amount of time ? grad f : year or two . postdoc a : would it be ? professor d : year or two ? phd i : but if that then you would think you 'd hear much more clamoring about data loss phd e : yeah . phd i : and professor d : i mean , yeah , all the l grad f : i i do n't know many people who do it on cd . i mean , they 're the most fo professor d : ldc - all the ldc distributions are on cd - rom . phd g : yeah . grad f : they 're on cd , but they 're not tha that 's not the only source . phd g : like grad f : they have them on disk . and they burn new ones every once in a while . but if you go if you go k phd i : but , you know , we have phd g : but we have like thirty you know , from ten years ago ? professor d : we have all sorts of cd - roms from a long time ago . phd e : yeah . phd g : yeah ! grad f : well , th th ok . phd g : ten years ago . phd i : right . phd g : ninety - one , and they 're still all fine . professor d : yeah . grad h : were they burned or were they pressed ? phd g : uh , both . i 've burned them and they 're still ok . grad h : yeah . grad f : the the pressed ones last for phd g : i mean , usually they 're grad f : well , not forever , they 've been finding even those degrade . professor d : oh , i see . grad f : but , uh , the burned ones i mean , when i say two or three years what i 'm saying is that i have had disks which are gone in a year . phd g : that 's what i grad f : on the average , it 'll probably be three or four years . but , uh i i you do n't want to per p have your only copy on a media that fails . and they do . um , if you have them professionally pressed , y you know , they 're good for decades . phd i : so how about ? so so how about putting them on that plus , like on a on on dat or some other medium that is n't risky ? grad f : i think th um , we can already put them on tape . and the tape is hi is very reliable . phd i : ok . mm - hmm . grad f : so the the only issue is then if we need access to them . so that 's fine f if we do n't need access to them . phd i : right . well , if if if you if they last say , they actually last , like , five years , huh , in in the typical case , and and occasionally you might need to recreate one , and then you get your tape out , but otherwise you do n't . ca n't you just you just put them on ? grad h : so you just archive it on the tape , and then put it on cd as well ? phd i : yeah . right . grad f : oh . so you 're just saying put them on c ds for normal access . grad h : yeah . phd i : right . phd b : what you grad f : yeah . i mean , you can do that but that 's pretty annoying , because the c ds are so slow . phd g : see yeah . grad h : yeah . phd b : what 'd be nice is a system that re - burned the c ds every year . phd g : h everytime it was a `` gon na `` `` gon na die `` . professor d : well grad f : well , i mean , the c ds are are an op phd e : yeah . phd i : it 's like like dynamic ra dram . phd e : just before . phd b : yeah . phd g : just before they be before it goes bad , it burns them in . grad f : the the cd is an alternative to tape . grad h : yeah . grad f : icsi already has a perfectly good tape system and it 's more reliable . professor d : you know i would think grad f : so for archiving , we 'll just use tape . phd i : one one thing i do n't understand is , if you have the data if if you if the meeting data is put on disk exactly once , then it 's backed - up once and the back - up system should never have to bother with it , uh , more than once . grad f : well , regardless well , first of all there was , um , a problem with the archive in that i was every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directories an or recursive chmod and chown , because they were n't getting set correctly every once in a while , phd i : mm - hmm . grad f : and i was just , doing a minus r star , not realizing that that caused it to be re - backed - up . phd i : mm - hmm . grad f : but normally you 're correct . but even without that , the back - up system is becoming saturated . phd i : but but this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something has n't changed and does n't need to be backed - up again . professor d : the b i think th the at least the once tha that you put it on , it would it would { comment } kill that . grad f : sure , but we still have enough changed that the nightly back - ups are starting to take too long . phd i : ok . so so then , if so so then , let 's grad f : it has nothing to do with the meeting . it 's just the general icsi back - up system is becoming saturated . phd i : right . ok . right . so , what if we buy , uh uh , what what do they call these , um high density ? grad f : well , why do n't you have this have a this conversation with dave johnson tha rather than with me ? phd i : no , no . because this is maybe something that we can do without involving dave , and and , putting more burden on him . how about we buy , uh uh uh , one of these high density tape drives ? and we put the data actually on non - backed - up disks . and we do our own back - up once and for all all , and then and we do n't have to bother this @ @ up ? grad f : actually , you know , we could do that just with the tape with the current tape . phd i : i dunno what the these tapes uh , at some point these i dunno . what kind of tape drive is it ? grad f : i dunno but it 's an automatic robot so it 's very convenient . phd i : is it is ? professor d : wh the o the one that we have ? grad f : you just run a program to restore them . phd i : right . professor d : the i mean grad f : yeah . phd i : but it might interfere with their back - up schedule , phd g : but professor d : no , we have s we do n't we have our own ? something wi th that does n't that is n't used by the back - up gang ? do n't we have something downstairs ? postdoc a : well they phd b : what kinda tape drive ? professor d : just in ? yeah . grad f : well but no , but andreas 's point is a good one . and we do n't have to do anything ourselves to do that . they 're already right now on tape . phd i : right . grad f : right . so your your point is , and i think it 's a good one , that we could just get more disk and put it there . phd i : mmm . on an xh uh , x x whatever partition . grad f : yeah . that 's not a bad idea . phd i : yeah . professor d : yeah , that 's basically what i was gon na say , is that a disk is is so cheap it 's es essentially , you know , close to free . and the only thing that costs is the back - up issue , eh , to first order . grad f : so once it 's on tape phd i : right . right . professor d : and we can take care of that by putting it on non - back up drives and just backing it up once onto this tape . phd i : mm - hmm . grad f : i think that 's a good idea . phd i : right . professor d : oh . yeah . good . it 's good . phd g : so , who 's gon na do these back - ups ? the people that collect it ? grad f : uh well , i 'll talk to dave , and and see what th how what the best way of doing that is . phd b : it 's probably gon na n grad f : there 's a little utility that will manually burn a tape for you , and that 's probably the right way to do it . phd b : yeah , and we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meetings . phd g : well , s yeah . that 's what i 'm wondering , if grad f : well we 're g we 're gon na automate that . my intention is to do a script that 'll do everything . phd g : i mean , you do n't have to physically put a tape in the drive ? grad f : no . it 's all tape robot , phd g : or s ? s ? { comment } oh , ok . grad f : so you just sit down at your computer and you type a command . phd g : so it 's just oh , ok . phd i : yeah , but then you 're effectively using the resources of the back - up system . or is that a different tape robot ? grad f : yeah . phd g : but not at the same time . grad f : but y but you would be anyway . phd b : no , no , no . grad f : right ? phd b : he 's saying get a whole different drive . grad f : because phd i : no , no . see grad f : but there 's no reason to do that . phd i : yeah , just give a dedi grad f : it we already have it there and it it 's phd i : well , i 'm saying is @ @ i if you go to dave , and and and ask him `` can i use your tape robot ? `` , he will say , `` well that 's gon na screw up our back - up operation . `` grad f : no , we wo n't . he 'll say `` if if that means that it 's not gon na be backed - up standardly , great . `` professor d : he - i dave has has promoted this in the past . so i do n't think he 's actually against it . grad f : yeah . it 's it 's definitely no problem . phd i : oh , ok . alright . professor d : yeah . phd i : alright . good . phd g : what about if the times overlap with the normal back - up time ? grad f : um , it 's it 's just it 's just a utility which queues up . it just queues it up and and when it 's available , it will copy it . professor d : yeah . grad f : and then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can , you know , do it a a few days later or whatever you wan na do , after you confirm that it 's really backed - up . nw ? postdoc a : you saying nw archive ? grad f : nw archive . postdoc a : yep { comment } and if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back - ups . grad f : that 's what it is . right . postdoc a : and then there would n't be this extra load . phd i : well , it if he you have to put the data on a on a non - backed - up disk to begin with . postdoc a : well , but you can have it nw archive to you can have , uh , a non - backed - up disk nw archived , grad f : right . phd i : so that so that otherwise you do n't you postdoc a : and it 'll never show up on the nightly back - ups . grad f : right . and then it never phd i : right . right . grad f : right . which i 'm sure would make ever the sysadmins very happy . phd i : right . postdoc a : yeah . grad f : so , i think that 's a good idea . that 's what we should do . so , that means we 'll probably wan na convert all all those files filesystems to non - backed - up media . phd b : that sounds good ."
