    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about the menu function and interaction with other tools of the remote control .",
    "answer": "project manager : good . um , then we 'll move to the three presentations . okay ? marketing : okay . project manager : okay . mm we need to move this . who wants to go f first ? that 's as far as it goes . user interface : uh not really meant to touch those microphones . oh it does n't have any on , does it ? that 's fine . marketing : excellent , thank you . industrial designer : oy , big loop under the table . project manager : she said we did n't need to screw it in . marketing : okay . okay , that looks good . project manager : it 's doing its thing . there we are . marketing : alright . thank you very much . um . one of the the biggest issues i found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and i think that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . so um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . and if we devote some energy into this , i think the um recent productions of real reaction , the i go everywhere power and the high definition d_v_d_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , i think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . and um in fact i think the high definition d_v_d_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool . so again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . um fifty percent i think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . and eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , d_v_d_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . industrial designer : could can i ask where these figures come from , is this market research we 've marketing : um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . project manager : now in between , as the project manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : um that teletext is outdated um marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for tv um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . marketing : mm-hmm . well i think we can i i think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the real reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly do n't um advertise for the i go everywhere line . so an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . so these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology industrial designer : marketing : and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition . project manager : okay . marketing : now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . very interesting , i i leave this up to the group to decide if we wan na use this uh if and you know , the the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five project manager : is that a large enough target market to target it ? marketing : well , i i i think especially in terms of growth , i think this would be a very smart group to target . i mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh project manager : in real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? marketing : yeah . to um yes . project manager : or eight million . marketing : yes . but would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did i know that it was it was an that 's a that 's a very good question . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : um marketing : i do n't know if speech recognition should be um should be included , but i think it 's an interesting i think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology . user interface : uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research marketing : shall i go back ? user interface : on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , marketing : yeah , yeah . user interface : and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : how d i 'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . i expect an industrial designer should know that , but if we 're aiming to to build this thing for twelve euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ? marketing : exactly . i mean i i i uh did not receive any information on that , but i think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what 's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an lcd screen and and that was n't responded to , but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the osbournes where ozzy osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray . industrial designer : sh surely he 's in the wrong age group . marketing : you know , project manager : marketing : it 's i a and i think , you know industrial designer : he must be w one of a s small population . marketing : no , no , you kate , you 're exactly right there . but i think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and uh they 'll be project manager : but we 're not looking at whether they 're early adopters on that screen , marketing : uh , mm . project manager : that 's looking at age groups . marketing : exactly . i yes , and i 'm making and i 'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . or comfortable , project manager : leap . hmm . mm . marketing : you know , um so project manager : okay , you had the other power channel . marketing : i think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers . and this is this is also supported by the market research . project manager : okay ."
