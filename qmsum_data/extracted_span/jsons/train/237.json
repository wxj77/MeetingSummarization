    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about the options for energy sources .",
    "answer": "industrial designer : okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . we could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . and they 're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . there 's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . a bit out of date . kinetic energy is something that 's been recently developed . project manager : um what is a hand-powered dynamo ? industrial designer : um , where you manually charge up the power . project manager : just every , every once in a while ? industrial designer : like you wind up something . project manager : just every once in a while or constantly ? industrial designer : sorry ? yeah . every once in a while i think project manager : alright . it 'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it i think . industrial designer : . but it 's yeah . it would be like going a step back in time . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i do n't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . project manager : no . marketing : industrial designer : whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that 's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . i mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . um , or there 's solar power , which we 've been considering inside a building , which is where it 's gon na be used , might not be quite so useful . project manager : right . industrial designer : but , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . that 's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . like how it 's comfortable and s sits in the hand . we do n't want something that 's huge and you ca n't pick up . or too small . or too slidy . i know i 've had a remote control before which you could n't tell which was the front and the back , project manager : alright . i like the kinetic energy source idea . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um , i do n't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . industrial designer : i thought that was project manager : but i think that it 's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um user interface : yeah , tha marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : energy source . it could make an we could have any kind of style . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it would n't be as heavy or bulky , and industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . just for environmental reasons . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : marketing : i guess it 's a bit scary 'cause it has n't been done before . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so it seems we 'd have to do more research on it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : or i dunno if you could have a battery pack . industrial designer : like as a backup for something . user interface : backup . yeah . marketing : yeah so there 's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries i believe . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : so , if it was running off of one battery as a user interface : that would be good yeah . industrial designer : yeah . some alternative just in case something went wrong . marketing : right . user interface : maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . industrial designer : that 's true . i just thought of that . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : so maybe that could be incorporated as industrial designer : may maybe that could be the backup . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : instead of a battery . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : like solar backup . marketing : although it needs some light , does n't it ? industrial designer : yeah . i suppose project manager : yeah , you can watch a tv in the dark then . user interface : do , do those calculators industrial designer : s but some marketing : so , if we 're doing user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . if we 're industrial designer : but thing is , it 's not you do n't need the solar all the time . user interface : i do n't know how it works . industrial designer : it can be stored . it can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : like a few hours a day . . project manager : i think that might be a little impractical though . marketing : yeah . i think sometimes it 's just shoved under , under a cushion , project manager : yeah . marketing : and yeah . industrial designer : that 's true . it could easily user interface : yeah . project manager : like people do n't wan na have to worry about that . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , i forgot to charge my remote today . user interface : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : like if the kinetic thing , i think what 's best about that is that it 's instant energy . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : you do n't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and it works . project manager : or just like pick it up when you 're gon na use it . industrial designer : yeah . instead of you do n't have to like make sure it 's in the right place to charge and . user interface : yeah , i suppose . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : alright . cool . industrial designer : k okay . project manager : yeah . yeah . okay . um , so back to decisions . energy , we 've decided on kinetic , right ? industrial designer : kinetic yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay , so that 's good . industrial designer : are we going to have a backup ? or do we just project manager : but would a backup really be necessary ? i mean will people just use the battery if there 's no , if there 's , industrial designer : i think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , project manager : if there is backup . industrial designer : and be bold and innovative , user interface : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and hope this works , and well hope that it works . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i think project manager : there 's like no reason why it would n't work , right ? industrial designer : yeah . i think no . i , i think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . marketing : so project manager : yeah . it could even be one of our selling points . industrial designer : go for it . it could be user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : fully kinetic energy . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : environmentally conscious or something . industrial designer : is everyone happy with that ? marketing : so if it 's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : hope so ."
