    "answer": "marketing : mm-hmm . okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we 're gon na use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . um can i just put this on ? so we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wan na buy it . um . this is to do this i will not remove my microphone . we basically used um some focus group surveys which i went through with you last time , the main results of that , and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um , industrial designer : marketing : and as part of this the important aspects that came out were things that we 've already discussed really . the most important by far was the look and feel of it . it needs to be something that 's very different from everything else out there . it needs to stand out . it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . people will wan na buy it . um that was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . people have to then think about it and say got something there that i want . that 's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wan na buy it again . third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . so they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . this is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . user interface : industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : um i had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that 's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . that would make it stand out . um . industrial designer : so can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ? project manager : spongy feel ? industrial designer : uh about the feeling yeah uh yo user interface : you can marketing : ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that 'll be something that sets it apart , industrial designer : okay . marketing : rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : so as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . so going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we 've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um . going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they 've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . that 's one way of looking at it um . textured feel we just talked about . maybe it 's another way of doing that . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so if it 's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . so they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . industrial designer : yeah that 's a very good idea , yeah . yeah . marketing : um and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . they 're big selling items . people put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it 's been lost , uh that 's one thing we could look at . there are other aspects like lcd screens and speech recognition which were n't i do n't think , in my personal opinion , gon na be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . i think we 're better doing something basic like this industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in . and use . i had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves , project manager : mm . yes well marketing : and then project manager : maybe matthew can can give some more information on the user interface : yeah . marketing : and then th th the finer details of buttons you do n't use as much either hidden away or completely separate . yep and that 's the presentation . user interface : voila . project manager : okay good , that 's very clear . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah very clear . project manager : 'kay . um . uh marketing : so does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? i think you project manager : maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh i 've it was a good idea maybe to to industrial designer : to let the people choose , you mean ? project manager : yes the the the there are changeable covers , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : but on the other hand i i do n't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational industrial designer : marketing : well we 're selling so many units of this . this is gon na be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least . project manager : hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects . marketing : mm mm . project manager : yes . mm-hmm . industrial designer : sure that fits the project manager : yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after-sales i mean that would would be very good i mean those covers could go for for three , five euro . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : that 's a very good idea um and then uh maybe uh we can go a th matthew 's presentation because marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : the user interface : then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together . project manager : together indeed uh , user interface : it should be easier with that . project manager : because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , industrial designer : yeah yeah i agree . marketing : mm-hmm , yeah . project manager : what you were already mentioning . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so industrial designer : and your part is very related to mine user interface : yeah . industrial designer : because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside . user interface : yeah so i 'll i 'll go with that actually"
