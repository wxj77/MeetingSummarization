    "answer": "grad b : and there is a tower and it 's called powder - tower . phd a : oh , ok . yeah . grad b : and um so what will you parse out of that sentence ? probably something that we specified in m - three - l , that is @ @ { comment } `` action go to whatever domain , object whatever powder - tower `` . and maybe some model will tell us , some gps module , in the mobile scenario where the person is at the moment . and um we 've sort of gone through that once before in the deep mail project and we noticed that first of all what are i should 've brought some slides , but what our so here 's the tower . think of this as a two - dimensional representation of the tower . and our system led people here , to a point where they were facing a wall in front of the tower . there is no entrance there , but it just happens to be the closest point of the road network to the geometric center because that 's how the algorithm works . so we took out that part of the road network as a hack and then it found actually the way to the entrance . which was now the closest point of the road network to phd a : yeah . grad b : ok , geometric center . but what we actually observed in heidelberg is that most people when they want to go there they actually do n't want to enter , because it 's not really interesting . they wan na go to a completely different point where they can look at it and take a picture . phd a : oh , ok . yeah . grad b : and so what uh uh a s you s let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance wo n't really give us is what the person actually wants . does he wan na go there to see it ? does he wan na go there now ? later ? how does the person wan na go there ? is that person more likely to want to walk there ? walk a scenic route ? and so forth . there are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things . and we are constructing and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role . information related to the user and information related to the situation . and we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that what we can get from the utterance . that 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wan na go there to look at it . and um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention was . and then enrich or augment the m - three - l structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance . so if it can make a good suggestion , `` hey ! `` you know , `` that person does n't wan na enter . that person just wants to take a picture , `` cuz he just bought film , or `` that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before `` . or `` that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something and that you usually do inside of buildings `` and so forth . these ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the m - three - l structure in an sort of subfield that we have reserved . and if the action planner does something with it , great . if not you know , then that 's also something um that we ca n't really at least we { comment } want to offer the extra information . we do n't really um we 're not too worried . phd a : mm - hmm . grad b : i mean t s ultimately if you have if you can offer that information , somebody 's gon na s do something with it sooner or later . that 's sort of part of our belief . grad e : what was he saying ? grad b : um , for example , right now i know the gis from email is not able to calculate these viewpoints . so that 's a functionality that does n't exist yet to do that dynamically , phd a : mm - hmm . grad b : but if we can offer it that distinction , maybe somebody will go ahead and implement it . surely nobody 's gon na go ahead and implement it if it 's never gon na be used , so . what have i forgotten about ? oh yeah , how we do it ,"
