    "answer": "marketing : evaluation . 'kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . my name , my job , okay . industrial designer : my name , my job . user interface : marketing : the methods . questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , user interface : right . marketing : like question , is remote big enough , we can say it 's true or it 's false by steps . one means absolutely not true , seven means true . user interface : yeah . marketing : the three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are , industrial designer : sorry , user interface : industrial designer : you used the powerpoint marketing : is the remote control fancy enough , user interface : yeah . marketing : is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use . and then evaluation itself . uh . user interface : industrial designer : what ? bling . marketing : okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : first question . is the design fancy enough ? user interface : well marketing : project manager , what do you think ? project manager : well it 's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . and the the curves which we decided , user interface : yeah . marketing : but does it yeah . project manager : only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? user interface : it uh oh it 's in the background . oh . industrial designer : now uh the single curved idea was uh yeah , okay , you ge um user interface : y you should make uh a sideways uh view . industrial designer : yeah . the sideways view , uh that that that ma user interface : it will be , i guess . oh , we can industrial designer : ho not that pen . not that pen . marketing : project manager : well user interface : g i would smart board . project manager : it might work one time , huh . industrial designer : suppose so . user interface : uh can i draw here or uh marketing : think . industrial designer : ah . oh my god , marketing : yeah , yeah , you can . user interface : so it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , industrial designer : it works . user interface : right ? industrial designer : yeah , that 's the single curve indeed . user interface : yeah . so if you v flip it like this . project manager : okay . user interface : here 's yeah . industrial designer : that 's not very i it 's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there , user interface : yeah . so you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , industrial designer : so uh user interface : so that it lays a bit o industrial designer : yeah . marketing : is n't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? user interface : yeah , that 's a bit of problem maybe . marketing : with two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you 're holding it quite a lot i think user interface : yeah . i think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it 's just nothing , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so if you could marketing : yeah . industrial designer : okay , indeed . yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay , but we have to rate uh these things now ? user interface : 'cause otherwise i think i marketing : yeah , we have to rate . project manager : okay . marketing : is it fancy enough ? true is one , false is seven . so fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . user interface : i think it does . industrial designer : i think so . user interface : i if you do n't make it green , then the elder people wo n't wo n't like it . industrial designer : it 's pretty fancy . marketing : i think yeah , i have to agree , all the colour colours don don does n't matter that m that much now , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you get th project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : it 's only design . user interface : i think it does . project manager : yeah . marketing : and the design . project manager : well i think uh especially because of the microphone and the lcd screen also . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . i do n't know whether older people will use it , but project manager : very new thing . well fancy the old people will . marketing : so user interface : i would make it a two or something . marketing : a two ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : it 's true , it 's a one . very fancy . user interface : huh ? alright , it 's a one . oh it 's a one . project manager : no , it 's a two . little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , i n used i wouldn i should use that one , but it does n't industrial designer : user interface : but it 's a one uh maybe uh marketing : okay , no it 's two ? true is a one . user interface : yeah . marketing : very true , is it very true or is n't that true ? project manager : well i 'd say two on a scale user interface : well they think it 's very true , but uh industrial designer : it 's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , marketing : yeah , i think two . user interface : yeah , industrial designer : so user interface : but industrial designer : it 's very fancy , i think . user interface : we should perhaps industrial designer : have you ever seen a remote control like this ? project manager : no , okay well , that 's true . industrial designer : no , okay , user interface : that not . industrial designer : so so it 's fancy . marketing : that 's fancy enough . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay , one two . marketing : then ? project manager : that does n't matter that much , so make it a one . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . let 's give it a two . is it innovative ? user interface : i think it is , marketing : enough . user interface : because it has an lcd screen , a mi microphone . industrial designer : and uh uh the scroll is rubber , user interface : it 's from rubber . marketing : we have for the search function . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so s eno enough to i think . marketing : the scroller a bit i think it 's it 's a one yeah . user interface : it 's a one i think . marketing : true . also huh uh-huh the buttons , are they easy to find ? that was a big requirement of the old people . industrial designer : user interface : yeah , because they 're right on your screen . so you can use the b the the arrows . they 're right on your screen , so i do n't know where you 'd search . industrial designer : with the ones marketing : are all the buttons easy to find ? not only this buttons , all the buttons . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : well , i think they are . the options are it uh little bit harder , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but if you touch the options then it 's uh industrial designer : take a harder look , yeah , sure . marketing : i think th it 's industrial designer : it 's easier than the regular uh remote control . marketing : easy t project manager : yeah , and you use these buttons the most , marketing : yeah , i think this is easy now . i think th i think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to project manager : huh ? so industrial designer : yeah . user interface : no they 're not , but they 're they 're they are easy to find . marketing : to handle . true . industrial designer : yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls marketing : i would rate it a industrial designer : where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button . marketing : yeah , okay , that 's true , that 's true . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most project manager : which marketing : but that 's that 's vantage of lcd screen , you can have text . project manager : so which number are we going to fill in ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i would say yeah . industrial designer : i think it 's uh it 's a two , at least . user interface : yeah . yeah , project manager : a two , yeah ? user interface : you can make it a two . project manager : two , three and industrial designer : it 's not perfect , but marketing : yeah . project manager : what do you think ? marketing : i think it 's a three . industrial designer : a three ? project manager : okay , so we have two , two , three . industrial designer : and why is that ? marketing : i personally think , because i d i do n't think i maybe it 's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . i i think if you have the button at the right , i do n't think you can find the option button that easy . user interface : yeah , but you do n't have t have to use the button on the right . you can touch it . marketing : you can touch it . user interface : yeah . you you can touch options . industrial designer : it said bo both the options . marketing : yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , user interface : yeah . marketing : right ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay , then okay , good . then i think also two , yeah . user interface : you can touch options project manager : a two , okay , user interface : and it 's comes out . project manager : because we have to industrial designer : a two , a two . user interface : the uh the um below . project manager : it 's the box below it , industrial designer : uh the next question the next question . oh my god . marketing : user interface : project manager : otherwise we have two results in one question . user interface : it 's different . industrial designer : project manager : okay , next question . marketing : it 's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people . user interface : for young people i think it 's easy to use . marketing : young means sixteen to forty years . industrial designer : yeah , i was uh user interface : yeah . marketing : and elderly from forty eight to their death . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i think it 's industrial designer : i think it 's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . user interface : in the entire mankind . project manager : okay , you 're very enthusiastic about your own design , marketing : also if you 're sixty years old industrial designer : yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh you do n't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so it 's t i think it 's really easy to use . you want these options to project manager : as well for the for the older people ? industrial designer : uh sure . marketing : yeah , as well as your if you 're fif sixty years old , you 're holding one of those things in your hand user interface : yeah , but uh yeah , but they they do n't want the uh extra options , right ? marketing : no , but we 're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , user interface : so project manager : and would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? user interface : yeah , okay , marketing : so it it it has to be user interface : but so they could uh i think it is . if they read a manual . project manager : because that might marketing : if you read the manual , user interface : yeah , alright . industrial designer : perhaps that is one of the most uh marketing : always . project manager : m maybe that 's the most user friendly and easy to use . user interface : because it it 's not it 's not it 's it 's not uh difficult . industrial designer : uh because a lot of user interface : you say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , industrial designer : channel one , channel four , yeah . user interface : then you say the question and the answer . and that 's everything it does , the speech recognition . industrial designer : project manager : yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . user interface : yeah . i think it would make it uh industrial designer : yeah , i think it does . marketing : so industrial designer : because all the people who ca n't uh user interface : i would make it two . marketing : also two ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh a two . sure , two . marketing : not a seven for this ? user interface : three ? project manager : i 'd say three . marketing : i would also say three . industrial designer : project manager : okay , so we have three three two two user interface : oh . you ? project manager : or so what are we going to do ? user interface : well two and a half . project manager : okay , a three , i see . uh user interface : three ? no . industrial designer : give me more . marketing : project manager : another question . marketing : remotes overwhelmed with buttons . no , that that 's that 's user interface : but um i mean , marketing : yeah . user interface : that 's definitely one . marketing : tha that 's a one , i think , that 's definitely a one . industrial designer : that 's definitely our uh user interface : oh nee , oh seven is it ? it is . yeah , uh marketing : oh yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah , user interface : the remote score . industrial designer : a false , yeah . project manager : but i think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , marketing : yeah , i think is n't , this has to be something like is n't overwhelmed . project manager : because otherwise we ca n't uh calculate anything from the results , user interface : it 's not overwhelmed . yeah . project manager : so industrial designer : yeah , indeed . marketing : true . project manager : okay , a one , because we designed for that , huh ? marketing : remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups . industrial designer : user interface : 'cause we make them in different colours , project manager : yeah . user interface : so that they uh industrial designer : yeah , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : is optional . project manager : yeah , and i though w we had about single colours , marketing : that 's true . project manager : but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , user interface : yeah . that it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah . project manager : ca n't you ? marketing : also with rubber ? user interface : uh i think you can . project manager : whether it looks like wood , it is n't w it is n't wood marketing : yeah , okay . project manager : but user interface : it it feels like rubber , project manager : you can make a print on rubber , user interface : but project manager : ca n't you ? yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so that 's a one then , user interface : well but then when you scratch it it does come off . marketing : yeah ? project manager : huh ? marketing : that 's a one ? user interface : so that 's a bit industrial designer : yeah , it is it is harder to marketing : okay . project manager : do you have many questions ? marketing : uh i have industrial designer : to like project manager : oh , okay well marketing : user interface : oh we have time . industrial designer : geez . project manager : yeah , but we have we also we have to get to the money . industrial designer : we 're getting paid . we 're getting paid . marketing : the material used is spongy , user interface : what ? marketing : that that 's uh that 's a one , that 's m rubber . project manager : what spongy . user interface : yeah , yeah , it 's very spongy . marketing : yeah , i th think it 's not the most spongy thing . user interface : but not it 's not very spongy , because it 's hard rubber . i think it 's a three . industrial designer : yeah , it 's a three , project manager : uh-huh , yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , user interface : hard but yeah . you can break it . industrial designer : because it has a lcd screen . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : hard to lose , marketing : remote control is hard to lose . industrial designer : yeah it sh and it 's easy to find . user interface : y yeah , you could you could call it . marketing : y you ca n't you ca n't lose it if you 're sixty years old . if first time see the thing you didn did n't adjust uh set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . user interface : yeah , y you can lose it , but it is n't hard to lose . marketing : it is n't hard , no . i think i think this is a two , personally . user interface : two . that it 's hard to lose ? yeah , it it is there 's the project manager : yeah , industrial designer : is n't hard to lose . project manager : so is n't hard to lose you . user interface : it 's a six , you think ? industrial designer : is n't hard to lose , yeah . marketing : is n't hard to lose . user interface : so it 's a two . yeah , you can lose it , so i do n't marketing : yeah . you ca n't lose it . user interface : you can make it a three i it does have an a built in function . marketing : or if you 're you 're sixty years old , your demands project manager : yeah , but a har a hard to lose is good . so it should this question should be hard to lose . it 's difficult to lose it . user interface : nee . hard to lose . oh right . industrial designer : yeah , this this is hard to lose . project manager : user interface : it is hard to lose . yeah , so then this is it is almost true , industrial designer : this project manager : a two . marketing : i think yeah , i think also . user interface : so a two . project manager : a two . industrial designer : two , yeah . project manager : okay . user interface : industrial designer : and most all because of the option to whoa . user interface : ooh . project manager : yeah , it 's okay . that happens above also . but maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal , marketing : yeah ? oh , okay . project manager : but yep . oh , it is n't , user interface : oh well , project manager : well okay . user interface : it does n't . industrial designer : put the cor cursor on the . project manager : remember . marketing : okay okay okay . industrial designer : click . marketing : remote control mainly be sold to younger people . user interface : i think it will , industrial designer : true . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : true . marketing : yeah ? true ? very true ? user interface : uh well industrial designer : uh yeah . uh project manager : there . user interface : i a marketing : no , i do n't think very true because the colours . user interface : a two . marketing : we have the colours . um we have the buttons is are n't that that much . industrial designer : materials , yeah . marketing : nah , the material is n't that user interface : it 's it 's much more younger . industrial designer : uh okay . so ma uh make it make it a two . marketing : so i don i think i think it 's a three . project manager : well i think it 's it 's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , project manager : did n't we ? user interface : i think it 's a two marketing : but i uh user interface : but marketing : okay , okay . project manager : what do you think ? marketing : i think because project manager : questions ? industrial designer : a two ? i think it 's two . i think it 's two too , two too too . project manager : two . uh-huh . marketing : yeah ? user interface : two two two . let 's make everything a two . marketing : in the features ? project manager : dissatisfy younger people . um user interface : younger people . it has industrial designer : well perhaps not . user interface : what did marketing : because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . user interface : yeah . well that it does n't . industrial designer : well , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , user interface : yeah bu but industrial designer : but it 's for a remote control i think it i it would satisfy those needs . user interface : i think they like the speech . you could call to your uh industrial designer : yeah , the speech possibility , user interface : yeah , and the screen , industrial designer : the colours . marketing : lcd screen and scroll . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : scroll options , yeah . marketing : i i think they 'll be quite met with their expectations . project manager : yeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something . user interface : right , that that that project manager : it has relatively few features , user interface : those are features . marketing : it 's three features , basically , project manager : with marketing : the lcd touch screen is feature . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : the microphone is a feature . user interface : are n't the features the microphone 's feature and that you can change the channel 's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , project manager : yeah . user interface : and that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . yeah . project manager : ours had other features with marketing : yeah , okay . i think yeah , and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings . industrial designer : the easy volume up button . user interface : those are features . industrial designer : remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . turn uh turn up the volume . marketing : yeah yeah . user interface : enough features ? marketing : so i 've chos i shou i think it 's it 's it 's a one . personally , yeah . i think once you 've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you 'd like , microphone extra , lcd screen extra , scroll thing extra . project manager : okay , you think one , user interface : yeah . project manager : what do you think ? user interface : i think two or three . project manager : you . three , yeah . i 'd say three , so two it is then user interface : yeah . yeah uh a two a two . just another two . marketing : make it make it a two . project manager : or industrial designer : one two three . marketing : or make it uh a fucking two . user interface : we like two . industrial designer : right . marketing : you can see the remote control is r_ and r_ . user interface : yeah , there 's r_ and r_ in front . project manager : yeah . marketing : has user interface : uh it 's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has r_ and r_ . marketing : oh yeah , do did have nah y you have the black one . user interface : yeah . marketing : and we 'll probably make also a yellow one . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , project manager : yeah , user interface : but not r_ and r_ yellow i think . project manager : maybe maybe two . well m th but the logo is on on the front , industrial designer : okay , true , yeah . marketing : maybe two . project manager : so a two , yeah , user interface : one d on i it 's the colours and the marketing : x_ marks spot . project manager : that 's marketing : and the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . user interface : i think it is , but i do n't know what you think . industrial designer : i think it 's easier to use than a regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . entirely explained . marketing : yeah , tha that 's so true . mm-hmm . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah , uh user interface : and you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal tv uh remote . industrial designer : yeah , you can navigate . uh . marketing : i think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . industrial designer : you 're not satisfied , okay . let 's start over again then . marketing : no , i 'm not not convinc . user interface : yeah . let 's make a different remote . well industrial designer : marketing : let 's go th for inhalation of air ] user interface : menu . industrial designer : marketing : i think it would be a t yeah , two . user interface : a two ? industrial designer : a two . marketing : now lower . project manager : oh , well that 's that 's pretty good , user interface : we only have twos . industrial designer : oh yeah , i think so . yeah . user interface : uh just twos . one three and a few ones . industrial designer : and three . marketing : so okay , we have one three , a one , that that have to got up . user interface : two threes . marketing : two two two two two . user interface : we m mostly have twos , so it 's pretty good . marketing : so two , yeah . the average is a two . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : the average . marketing : that is quite good user interface : yeah . i think so too . industrial designer : yeah , i think so . marketing : in my opinion . that user interface : we can be happy . industrial designer : save . user interface : yeah . what is it ? it 's like a bug or something . industrial designer : it 's a fly . user interface : a fly , yeah . a f butterfly . yeah . that 's it . marketing : okay ."
