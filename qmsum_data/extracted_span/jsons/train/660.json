    "answer": "postdoc g : hope so . but the pre - segmentation really helps a huge amount . and , uh , also dan ellis 's innovation of the , uh the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps . but , um , just out of curiosity i asked one of them how long it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set . she said it takes about , uh , sixty minutes transcription for every five minutes of real time . so it 's about twelve to one , which is what we were thinking . grad h : or yep . postdoc g : it 's well in the range . grad h : it 's pretty good . postdoc g : ok . uh , these still , when they 're finished , um , that means that they 're finished with their pass through . they still need to be edited and all but but it 's word level , speaker change , the things that were mentioned . ok , now i wanted to mention the , um , teleconference i had with , uh , jonathan fiscus . we spoke for an hour and a half and , um , had an awful lot of things in common . he , um , um , he in indicated to me that they 've that he 's been , uh , looking , uh , uh , spending a lot of time with i 'm not quite sure the connection , but spending a lot of time with the atlas system . and i guess that i mean , i i need to read up on that . and there 's a web site that has lots of papers . but it looks to me like that 's the name that has developed for the system that bird and liberman developed { comment } for the annotated graphs approach . grad h : mm - hmm . postdoc g : so what he wants me to do and what we what we will do and uh , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting for him to be able to experiment with in this atlas system . and they do have some sort of software , at least that 's my impression , related to atlas and that he wants to experiment with taking our data and putting them in that format , and see how that works out . i i i explained to him in in detail the , uh , conventions that we 're using here in this in this word level transcript . and , um , you know , i i explained , you know , the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately and and the focus on reliability . he expressed a lot of interest in reliability . it 's like he 's he 's really up on these things . he 's he 's very um , independently he asked , `` well what about reliability ? `` so , he 's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing . ok , um"
