    "answer": "project manager : let 's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we 've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . so um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product . marketing : okay . okay . project manager : so back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . marketing : yeah . project manager : um i mean what does everybody think about marketing : yeah . project manager : does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ? i mean that 's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? user interface : um i think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit . project manager : so maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you 'd hold onto comfortably or user interface : um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . project manager : so something quite curvy ? okay um right okay . colour-wise i mean you made a re uh was it you or uh i ca n't remember who made the point about how if you 've a nice bright colour you 'll not lose it , was that industrial designer : i think he made that . project manager : whose user interface : marketing : what 's that ? project manager : about how if you have a bright colour you 'll not lose it so much . marketing : yeah . project manager : um and when the corporate colour is yellow , i mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow i do n't know . um marketing : okay . project manager : and then obviously the uh the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? that 's all . marketing : well i mean i 'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : you said company colour yellow . i mean if we think of something , like i was saying also lime and lemon you know , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . we just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the project manager : okay . marketing : shapes and things . project manager : right . industrial designer : is there a particular shape that you 're interested in ? like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? marketing : industrial designer : does it need with a square thing wha project manager : oh you know like in circular in shape or industrial designer : yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of marketing : yeah . project manager : choice of material yeah . industrial designer : like fruit . i 'm thinking fruits in my head , but that 's tacky . project manager : 'cause i i i was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , user interface : see i 'm project manager : and they 're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . it feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . and then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it 's gon na have to be boxy and rectangular and i think we might be moving away from that you know so um well i 'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or marketing : no no no not at all . project manager : no i do n't think we do either . marketing : it 's more more just that we we think about like what it is we 're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . project manager : okay right well um marketing : do you know what i mean ? project manager : so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . user interface : i 'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . project manager : a snowman shape ? user interface : um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . project manager : uh-huh . that 's quite a distinctive shape , marketing : right , project manager : that would be good marketing : sure . project manager : would n't it . yeah marketing : yeah . project manager : so yeah should we go with that ? marketing : um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a project manager : do you wan na draw it on the board ? user interface : marketing : can you like yeah just t we can visualize it . user interface : um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside project manager : ooh that 'd be good . user interface : or uh you have volume controls about there . marketing : okay . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . yep . project manager : so call it the snowman-shape trademark . yeah that 's cool . um and i mean colour-wise what does everybody think ? i think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . i mean do you want the whole thing yellow , maybe like yellow and white do you want something user interface : so i reckon it 'd look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , marketing : project manager : uh-huh . user interface : and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . project manager : okay cool . um and also i mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? the fact that it talks to you , i mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , i dunno . or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . user interface : i think that might scare me . project manager : i d i d any thoughts on that at all ? user interface : i think that 'd probably scare me . you turn it on your control possessed s . project manager : i know . um unless an a i mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an lcd display , where would we put that ? would we put that on the inside or industrial designer : do we need an lcd display ? user interface : um industrial designer : what what 's the functionality of that ? project manager : it 's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , i would 've thought . industrial designer : yeah but the question is what are we using it marketing : what would it achieve ? industrial designer : what would we what would we achieve from it ? putting in lights is cheap but putting in an lcd panel just to make it glow is a bit of a marketing : well l_c_ well i 'd when you used to mention the lcd i 'd think i wonder what that would be about . and the th the thing i could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . project manager : yeah . marketing : so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . industrial designer : mm-hmm . i think that will be a problem because we do n't have an input device to get the listings into it , marketing : right , okay . industrial designer : so um it 's a bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday you know . project manager : mm oh yeah that 's true . yeah . so so no need for an lcd display ? marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : um i i 'm not saying there 's no need for an lcd display , but um it 's what 's what what would it tell the user , project manager : i think that would make it very complex . industrial designer : 'cause the lcd tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : mm not real industrial designer : we have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ? marketing : project manager : i do n't know if there is really , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : no um industrial designer : um project manager : i would say no need for a talk-back . uh does anybody disagree with that ? industrial designer : you could put a game on it . project manager : no ? user interface : marketing : project manager : easy . industrial designer : when the tv dies you can play with the remote control . project manager : okay um right marketing : mm mm . project manager : so you 're gon na have the three different sets of of functionalities , um i mean do you wan na group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you 're thinking ? user interface : um well i think the advanced ones the the ones you do n't usually use could be hid inside . project manager : okay . user interface : b um i think the we had were fairly basic ones , they 'd have to go on the the front somewhere . project manager : okay right um what else do you need to talk about ? marketing : well i i was just industrial designer : where would you physically position the buttons ? um i think that that has some impact on on on many things . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um maybe you wan na draw onto the user interface : um marketing : yeah . project manager : so i 'm just gon na um pop this in here 'cause i have a slide about decision making which i 'd forgotten about . oh sh god we 've got five minutes um okay uh back we go . um energy what do you think that 's suggesting we 're how we 're powering the thing ? i really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you 'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , marketing : yeah , sure . project manager : i mean what does anybody think about that ? marketing : um i 've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you 're committing the user to moving it , industrial designer : no , like i said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it 's not gon na charge the battery , it 's just marketing : and watches yeah sure , okay , right , okay . project manager : okay . marketing : support for it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i mean just it 's just worth pointing out because like i 've i 've known i 've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and it 's just like magic because it 's always powered and there 's no battery . i 've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it 's just too much of a nuisance because i do n't wear it all the time . project manager : yeah . marketing : like remote control is similar , you 're away on vacation , i dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . project manager : yeah . well i suppose that if you 're if you 're away and you 're not using it , then you 're not using any power either . marketing : so we should think about project manager : so you 'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea marketing : yeah . project manager : i 'm really sorry we 're gon na have to wrap up quite quickly , we do n't have as much time as i thought . um so i think that 's what energy is referring to here . chip on print , is that that 's an industrial design thing , is it david ? industrial designer : yes yes . project manager : okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that marketing : and this size here , i 'd suggest this be small , like quite small . project manager : yeah i know we 're gon na have like rubber buttons that feel kind of okay . user interface : yeah i think so yeah . marketing : um just a a lot of the um i mean one of the things running through my mind right now , i realise we 're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it 's almost like we 're reproducing the same old remote control that 's out there . project manager : mm 'kay . marketing : should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme like what is it that we 're u we 're using to to achieve those goals ? project manager : could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that . marketing : like okay so so backlighting , that would be good . industrial designer : or even a clear case . um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , marketing : yeah clear , project manager : aye that would be a good idea . marketing : okay . industrial designer : but in the dark it sort of , it 's alive . user interface : marketing : yeah sure . industrial designer : um in in a slight subtle way . project manager : s so like cur slightly transparent case , so it 's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . marketing : yeah that 'd be really good . industrial designer : yeah yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . project manager : is that what you mean ? industrial designer : you know you have cordless mice and they do n't eat that much power right . marketing : sure . industrial designer : so the power the battery in that sense , marketing : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights marketing : yeah . industrial designer : that sort of marketing : sure . yeah they they emanate a light through it . project manager : okay . industrial designer : but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , does n't make it freaky . project manager : lights . marketing : 'kay . yeah , project manager : okay . marketing : mm-hmm . um and then the other thing that we we 're s we 've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so i 'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that 's the main thing people will f wan na do . could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? industrial designer : the question is when you 're rolling it , how do you wan na roll it ? marketing : or industrial designer : do you want 'em to roll it like that ? do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 'cause in a mouse your hand 's in a position to roll it , project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , could n't you ? marketing : well why do n't we do it like a mouse then ? project manager : if you 're holding it in your hand you could industrial designer : that 's a very unnatural motion to project manager : do you think ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . um it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but not for channels right . if you have a telewest box you 've got like , you do n't have to buy all the channels , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : you 've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay okay industrial designer : um and i do n't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it 's confusing to the marketing : yeah , sure . project manager : um user interface : well , but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button , the number part . industrial designer : i dunno . but users tend to tend to want to use that project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and once they lose out on the user experience they 're like because that 's becomes the most accessible thing in front of project manager : okay . user interface : uh but project manager : okay . marketing : but that 's not a bad thing is it ? project manager : just marketing : because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : jog dials are much easier than that . project manager : okay um right well would n't it marketing : you just roll . project manager : we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . um i 'm all for them actually , i think they 're quite you know th very quick to m to use . marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : so does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? no . and the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? marketing : yeah like i mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , project manager : uh-huh . marketing : i would n't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , i dunno , that it 's within the shape of the hand , it 's quite small project manager : uh-huh ooh okay , we really got ta wrap up marketing : i dunno . project manager : so yeah . marketing : yeah . it 's small , and that we 've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , project manager : okay well if we can do that , great . marketing : and that yeah project manager : yeah okay . marketing : well i mean is n't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ? project manager : yeah let 's let 's try and get the slogan on there um , and marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so you wan na expand the shape of the marketing : and then like a jo and then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like i dunno like here , in with the industrial designer : that that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you 're left handed or you 're right handed you might be locking yourself in . marketing : it would get bumped , it 's does n't really fit with your hand . yeah . or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here . industrial designer : could i just could i just jump in and suggest something quickly ? project manager : okay . right i 'm gon na have to user interface : marketing : a jog di project manager : i 'm really gon na have to hurry you on here 'cause we 're we 're actually over time . um is there anything anybody 's unsure about ? marketing : . it 's kind of yeah project manager : just for in closing just the next meeting 's gon na be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gon na hopefully be doing , uh i know that the designers are gon na be working with play-doh on that . marketing : yeah . project manager : so um that 'll be that 'll be good . um and i 'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . anything at all you think we have n't discussed that we need to ? is everybody kind of happy about what they 're gon na be doing ? marketing : um industrial designer : um i think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that 's gon na have quite a big impact on the thing um marketing : yeah i think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , industrial designer : yeah that 's what i was thinking the marketing : that 'd be great . industrial designer : a slide , because then you you do n't have to put the hand . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward . project manager : okay . industrial designer : there 's lots of space for it um project manager : that 's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah . industrial designer : yeah but it 's also a a marketing and a function user interface : marketing : sure , yeah , project manager : okay . marketing : yeah and materials we sorta said we 'd do plastic and rubber , did n't we , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : and i think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that 'd just be so standard . project manager : to make something flush with the case ? marketing : something a bit more flush , yeah , project manager : okay right . marketing : or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well , project manager : okay . marketing : so that it has and also t plastic i 've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . project manager : sp kinda grippy ? industrial designer : feel like fruit . project manager : okay . industrial designer : fruits kids . user interface : marketing : they feel kind of like um , you get pens now and then that you 'd think that they were rubber but they 're not , industrial designer : no like yeah yeah . marketing : they 're actually just plastic that 's textured , industrial designer : yeah yeah kinda like that yeah . marketing : kind of a little bit like project manager : okay i 'm gon na have to i 'm gon na have to call this to a close 'cause we 're way over time . so um that 's really good , like we 've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so . marketing : okay . project manager : so off you go and design stuff marketing : okay . project manager : wooh . marketing : industrial designer : play-doh time . project manager : yeah quite jealous actually . industrial designer : you got to choose first . no , we 're kidding . marketing :"
