    "query": "<s> what did user interface think about the voice recognition system of the remote when discussing the components of the remote ?",
    "answer": "user interface : um . there was n't much more to say about that , just rambling . um some of the uh remotes that i looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions . and uh it was quite uh a swish model , where it can control uh four devices , tv , cable , satellite , video , d_v_d_ , audio . um so that 's a bit of competition there . so i mean maybe it 's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control industrial designer : yeah , yeah . user interface : rather than trying to compete with the functions . um the scroll buttons , as you 've already mentioned , um there 's examples of those , but they do n't look as sleek as other models . and there 's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it 's not great . industrial designer : on the price , yeah . project manager : so you were saying the scroll buttons user interface : um yeah . th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um . there was children 's remote , where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : 'kay . user interface : um but i do n't know if that 's really in our field ? industrial designer : i guess i guess we 're going for the biggest market , maybe not , user interface : but that 's something that 's out there . industrial designer : but was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ? project manager : well we 're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that would n't necessarily preclude the one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in you know like a you 'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . but that 's really where your field is . user interface : marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : industrial designer : so maybe the children 's remote should be like a a next step , but maybe i dunno for ours , maybe we should project manager : anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one i 'm reckoning that we 're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : okay . project manager : is that user interface : right well that 's something that we can be aware of . project manager : so so what are we deciding to do here ? user interface : um . i think because there 's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function . project manager : right . mm-hmm . uh the fi yeah , the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah ."
