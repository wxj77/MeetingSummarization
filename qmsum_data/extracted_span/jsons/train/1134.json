    "query": "<s> summarize the whole meeting .",
    "answer": "project manager : uh welcome back after lunch , i hope uh you had a good lunch together . for uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . okay and the agenda will be the opening and uh that 's uh the product manager or secretary that 's me and uh the presentations from the christine and uh agnes and from mister ed . and finally in this meeting we have to decide marketing : project manager : and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design so we have forty minutes , i think it 's uh little bit uh low , but i i hope we can finish it up so i 'll handle to the the functional team , to the christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept . industrial designer : okay . so uh , if you could open the powerpoint presentation . marketing : industrial designer : i 'm number two . project manager : you 're number two . 'kay industrial designer : components design , there we go . marketing : industrial designer : so uh can we put it in slide show mode ? yeah . project manager : the next one . industrial designer : right here , is that little that one , yes please . marketing : industrial designer : thank you . project manager : industrial designer : i 'll take the mouse . so uh project manager : industrial designer : we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . in instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , project manager : industrial designer : you have to have microphone well no you do n't actually i have n't have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way marketing : industrial designer : it has to it has to hear the speaker user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it 's gets lost . um so the other w thing that we so . our method for going about this is we 've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what 's worked , what has n't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials marketing : industrial designer : and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing did n't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research . marketing : industrial designer : so um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . marketing : industrial designer : course , you know , i wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh does n't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore , user interface : industrial designer : so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that 's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor user interface : industrial designer : and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it 's uh goes with the board . uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it 's brittle it gets brittle after a while , user interface : industrial designer : so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium 's also been eliminated uh , user interface : industrial designer : the m people in manufacturing said that you could n't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how apple did it with th powerbook i 'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they 've eliminated all of our options except wood . user interface : at least it 's environmentally friendly . industrial designer : so , this is our finding . marketing : industrial designer : and a as she said , it 's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we 're we 're currently uh proposing , marketing : industrial designer : uh we 'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . marketing : industrial designer : so then there 's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , user interface : project manager : industrial designer : uh these simple chips , but that 's only works for the bu you do n't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . and um then there was the regular which i regret that i 've forgotten exactly why i 'm eliminating that one . uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , marketing : industrial designer : which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . marketing : industrial designer : and uh manufacturing has told us that they 've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um i i 'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , user interface : industrial designer : you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . i think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then i uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . so this is the findings of our research marketing : industrial designer : and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . do you have any problems with that ? project manager : can you go back uh one slide ? industrial designer : i 'm not sure , how do i oh , i know , let 's see . user interface : thank you . yeah . industrial designer : let 's go back up here . project manager : yes , uh question , uh , what 's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? what 's the meaning of that ? industrial designer : i think it 's um um a multiple uh chip design um and it 's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . user interface : project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : industrial designer : uh i could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . project manager : yeah , is it means it 's on the yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh industrial designer : i do n't know , but i 'll find out more at our next meeting . project manager : okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good . marketing : industrial designer : sounds good . user interface : why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? industrial designer : because um it gets brittle , cracks user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um we want we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . so . good ex good expression . user interface : whic which marketing : good expression . well after us . user interface : industrial designer : i do n't know , speak for yourself , i 'm planning to be around for a while . user interface : although i think marketing : user interface : i think with wood though you 'd run into the same types of problems , would n't you , i mean it chips , it if you drop it , industrial designer : marketing : user interface : uh it 's i 'm not su industrial designer : project manager : so so you 're not convinced about the the wood , yes . user interface : industrial designer : you 're what ? marketing : actually , i 'm ready to sell it . user interface : i think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , marketing : i 'm ready to sell it . industrial designer : you think ? and you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . user interface : but you ca n't just use marketing : no y no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , user interface : yeah , exactly , yeah . marketing : but there are some very pretty woods out there . industrial designer : well i 'm glad you user interface : marketing : that 's actually very innovative idea . industrial designer : okay , good . user interface : industrial designer : sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . marketing : industrial designer : marketing : well , it 's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : the stain . marketing : i mean it 's each person is gon na have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that 's not on the market . user interface : project manager : yeah , so it it 's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ? marketing : user interface : um , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own project manager : yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first marketing : in turns of wow . industrial designer : user interface : industrial designer : she works in the cubicle next to me so she 's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this . user interface : y yeah . marketing : industrial designer : luckily ed was not . user interface : marketing : wood ? user interface : i think we can get the quality materials then it should n't influence the design principles too much , which you 'll see with my presentation . marketing : user interface : one thing we 'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh industrial designer : mm-hmm . yeah , you would n't wan na have to have splinters in your hand while you 're using your user interface : yeah , for example . so , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , marketing : industrial designer : it 's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . user interface : but marketing : user interface : marketing : they do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , industrial designer : yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . marketing : so , and chew 'em up . and chew 'em up . project manager : okay then , uh , let 's move to agnes . user interface : sure . industrial designer : oh , i 'm sorry . project manager : s you 're user interface : project manager : you are in participant three . user interface : one point three , yeah marketing : user interface : uh , yeah . project manager : this one ? user interface : i think so , yeah . yeah , that 's the one . so , it 's a very short presentation , 'cause i 'm actually gon na draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of marketing : user interface : i took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which i completely agree with christine 's idea to have it sort of molded , so it 's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . industrial designer : right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example . user interface : so , that 's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . um , one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , marketing : user interface : so that you do n't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they 're not pressing the buttons while you 're trying to watch a tv show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : and also um you had issues with the batteries running out , marketing : user interface : so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . and in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so , in terms of what this thing would actually look like marketing : user interface : despite working in interface design , i 'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you 'll have to forgive me . you 'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you do n't accidentally turn your tv off while you 're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . and then here you 'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your tv project manager : user interface : and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . so that if the user does n't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you do n't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . industrial designer : mm . mm-hmm . user interface : um , so again you can have a little lcd light somewhere , the flip thing and have i forgotten anything ? i do n't think so . so , as you can see , it 's a very very simple design , marketing : no . project manager : user interface : which is one of the things i really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . project manager : industrial designer : a hinge . be like a copper hinge or you know . project manager : user interface : yeah . but you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you do n't want it to start getting too heavy . industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm . user interface : but that 's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . as you can see , there 's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . industrial designer : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . user interface : so , that 's pretty much all i had to say , i mean , everything else in terms of design issues . um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it 's used less frequently . industrial designer : mm . mm-hmm . user interface : so once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less i think it should go along those lines . project manager : so what 's your , uh , the comments or uh s marketing : simple design . it 's what consumers want . it 's almost like , houston , we have a product here . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : problem is obviously gon na be cost . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : okay , i also have a f very simple presentation , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : i also have uh copied a different type of remote . if you can find me , where i 'm at . there should only be one in here . trend watch . industrial designer : sure . marketing : it 's being modified . user interface : marketing : they 're stealing our product . we 've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause uh trends change very very quickly . in six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it 's gon na be a question how fast we can act . uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh . user interface : no , no . industrial designer : f go to findings . project manager : marketing : no no , no no . 'cause i had another comment there . uh the market trend . this is what we know from the last uh from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we 've done , fancy and feel-good , that 's what we 've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that 's easy to use . looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they 're all very similar , they all do the same thing , project manager : industrial designer : marketing : we have to have something completely different . okay ? easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it 's a remote that 's easy to use . and i think this is another thing that 's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . so even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . the second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . the second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : the first one , i see that they put in a display . now there 's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we 're adding all kinds of things in , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . user interface : yeah . marketing : maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you 're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display user interface : industrial designer : context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the tv or the d_v_d_ or something else is in . user interface : right . marketing : okay because i 've seen mostly the standard ones , user interface : especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and marketing : yeah . now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . the idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you 're doing . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : industrial designer : you know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , marketing : , we might 've user interface : oh yeah . industrial designer : and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . user interface : yeah , so it 's really molded to to your specific industrial designer : to t an and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : marketing : how hard they squeeze ? user interface : industrial designer : yes you 'd know what kind of wood to get . marketing : resistance resistance , right . user interface : but th for that you 'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . industrial designer : that 's right , that 's right , you would n't wan na go too far down that . oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect , yeah . user interface : the sales , yeah . project manager : the yeah . i hope so . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : no , but incorporating the three uh obviously it 'd be something totally new on the market , totally different user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : and from user interface : well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . marketing : although , what it was it uh it was uh nokia that came out with this changeable colours . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face user interface : yeah . industrial designer : right , mm . user interface : and that took off , yeah , yeah . marketing : and then they sold millions , millions . so . so say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : we have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . industrial designer : we 'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gon na get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wan na um learn about um labour laws . project manager : industrial designer : you know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you do n't wan na exploit uh labour in um third world countries . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you 're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you 're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . project manager : marketing : user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , india industrial designer : cost of living is low . project manager : yes , yes , countries like india or china or malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . so industrial designer : good , well th that 'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more project manager : yeah , yeah , so yes . user interface : mm yeah . industrial designer : and to where marketing : where w where it would be manufactured is is another step . project manager : so yeah , so marketing : we 're here to design , come up with a nice product . project manager : yes uh , but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so we do n't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something , industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . so , but uh le let 's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh ed was talking . and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so user interface : mm-hmm . i think it depends , i mean i think it 's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it 's gon na be because theoretically with the tv you already have a big display right in front of you . project manager : yeah . user interface : so , if we 're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for , industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : 'cause if it 's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that 's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , project manager : user interface : but that 's just sort of speculation , i mean . industrial designer : what do you think ed ? do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ? marketing : no . no industrial designer : do you wan na take an action item to go find out ? marketing : no p spec it 's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . industrial designer : okay . sorry about that . marketing : um , no that 's no problem . i 'm here for the pushing it after it 's made . i will market it . industrial designer : marketing : once we get a price on it then we can market it . industrial designer : so the the advanced chip on print is what um what we 've we 've deci we 've determined marketing : industrial designer : and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um i think we 've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . project manager : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : a customisable and marketing : nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . user interface : what about the buttons , would would the buttons be wood too , or industrial designer : uh i do n't think so , no , project manager : i do n't think so . industrial designer : i think they could be rubber like they are now , project manager : yes . yes . industrial designer : so you have that tactile experience of project manager : do n't looks nice uh . yeah , so uh what we 'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th ed find outs about the how much it 's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . okay . so user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . user interface : okay . project manager : okay ? user interface : sure . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : so um are we done with this meeting ? project manager : yeah , i hope , if is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay . then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can uh submit to the i will submit to the management . okay ? then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it 's cost as extra for uh the display . industrial designer : project manager : an and the marketing strategy , that 's very important , okay . industrial designer : and a marketing strategy . marketing : and marketing strategy , thank you . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : yes . how much you can marketing : fired . project manager : how mu how much how much you can sell extra . user interface : project manager : of course you 'll make money too , industrial designer : project manager : so it it 's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission . user interface : marketing : user interface : marketing : project manager : okay , so , any questions ? so , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then uh , then we can proceed from there . user interface : okay . project manager : it 's okay ? user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then . okay ? user interface : okay ."
