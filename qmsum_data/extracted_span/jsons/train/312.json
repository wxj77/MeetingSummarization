    "answer": "project manager : however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an lcd which has been kind of put forward so far , it 's almost like having a small t_ not tv to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , i do n't know how much power an lcd would take , but it might be quite low ? marketing : mm . i uh industrial designer : lcd on the remote just telling you what 's on , or uh , interactive lcd or project manager : well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone , something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : that could be one possibility . um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels user interface : mm . i i was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels . project manager : we industrial designer : do you think that people will get mixed up , like , they 'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , you know , trying to get everything working , would it be a bit confusing ? user interface : um i think probably for the first couple of hours of using it industrial designer : yeah ."
