    "query": "<s> how did wjec respond to the criticisms from estyn about the materials ?",
    "answer": "mark reckless am : gareth , can i just put to you\u2014 ? on the estyn criticism , i think you 've answered one aspect of their criticism that wjec did not make as many sample assessment materials available as schools would have liked early on in the reform process , and i understand your position there , but they went on and said , 'at times the sample assessment materials were provided with incorrect mark schemes ' and also , 'it would be helpful if the wjec ensure that all necessary resources were made available before the start date of each qualification . ' do you have a response to those points ? gareth pierce : again , probably , i 'd like a conversation with them about any problems with the specimen assessments and their mark schemes , because if they are the statutory regulatory ones they would have gone through philip 's team as well or his welsh government predecessors as regulators , depending on which qualifications they were . obviously , we need to be spot-on with those . very occasionally , somebody will identify an error , and obviously we then correct them , because these are available digitally online . so , if there is a problem , we want to hear about it and then we can correct it . but , yes , i agree with their fundamental premise , that ideally the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts , including , as we mentioned earlier , so we can draw on that set of resources in the events we run as wjec free of charge for teachers leading up to the first teaching . we need that information ourselves as well so we can talk about the use of these valuable resources in an appropriate pedagogical context in that preparatory year . so , the ideal is that everything is there 12 months ahead . mark reckless am : so , what mechanism do you have for picking up on this type of criticisms from estyn and having that conversation with them ? has that not happened ?"
