    "answer": "user interface : okay . just so you know i think i mean it was my understanding that before we were gon na stay in the mid-market range . it seems we 're kind of approaching a higher-end range . project manager : i think we are yeah . user interface : i wan na make sure everybody 's okay with that . marketing : yeah yeah . well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this . project manager : yeah well we do n't have it 's not that we have more money , marketing : did n't you say so ? project manager : we can push up the the price . marketing : that 's what i mean . project manager : yeah . marketing : we can increase the cost . user interface : okay . project manager : 'kay . marketing : so i do n't know i do n't know whether having user interface : i just wan na make sure everybody 's on board with it . so project manager : yeah . so we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we have n't got to a stage where we 're ready to pin down the price of components . but i 'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ? marketing : well i think th i think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it 's gon na cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit . project manager : yeah no i i think that 's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand . we 're entering a new market here , user interface : right . project manager : so i think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to marketing : okay i 'm i 'm okay with that . i guess what i just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level . project manager : but th what 's our ballpark as to what we 'd be able to sell something like this for ? user interface : well y yeah . let 's let 's try and think now , how much would you pay for marketing : we have to find cost . user interface : with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your tv remote , how much would you pay for that ? project manager : but you 've got ta think who our target market is because i i 'm not our target market . user interface : i 'm just asking you . project manager : i 'm a student , but on the other hand i would think , mm with my project manager salary , i would think yeah i could probably afford this user interface : if industrial designer : user interface : then you could probably afford this . project manager : uh would i buy it ? maybe . if i had a cool new tv and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which i think 's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little . then maybe you know . i do i do n't think i 'd go over a hundred euro certainly , that would be way too much , user interface : oh no no . project manager : but the i would be happy paying over forty for it , i guess , but not much user interface : i would say thirty five to forty . marketing : yeah , i was gon na say thirty five to fifty . project manager : 'kay . thirty five to fifty euros is our sales bracket okay . so the question is what we ca we make it for . user interface : okay . marketing : because one of th one of the things we 're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television . user interface : right . marketing : it 's one of the marketing features in this ."
