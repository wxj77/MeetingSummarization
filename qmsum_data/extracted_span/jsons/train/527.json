mister . user interface : ah well if no one else wants to , yeah . okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal . project manager : user interface : let 's see . well , i do n't really have a favourite animal , but um project manager : you have one in mind ? user interface : uh i think i have one in mind , so uh i 'm gon na about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . the spider has a spider lives in a web and uh it has eight legs , and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . unless it 's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . there are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . and uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it 's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else . so i think they did this in uh in charlotte 's web that movie that little uh well it 's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . project manager : okay . user interface : so , that 's my animal . project manager : th thank you . very interesting . guillermo you want to ? marketing : 'kay i dunno why , but when i was a child i i wanted to be a a panther project manager : marketing : not a pink panther , industrial designer : but do n't you think it 's very difficult to draw a panther ? marketing : or maybe yes . project manager : it would be very funny for us . marketing : uh yeah yeah . industrial designer : so bad i do n't like it . marketing : okay it 's a friendly panther . user interface : industrial designer : user interface : maybe it 's happy 'cause it just ate someone . marketing : yeah maybe . user interface : marketing : um . actually , honestly i i i dunno what 's what 's his it 's be behaviour , i dunno if if it 's the male who who hunts or it 's the female uh , i i i have watched that lions di did n't hunt it 's the the female lions who who hunt , so but i like it because it 's fast , and it 's black as well , so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it 's it 's it looks like um powerful , strong , uh i dunno . i i watch a a film about a black panther when i was a child and i was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot . user interface : project manager : okay . thank you . marketing : okay . project manager : hemant . industrial designer : um sure . project manager : user interface : so you do n't like pink panthers ? marketing : i like it . project manager : industrial designer : oh yeah . thanks . this lapel is coming out once in a while . it 's not very strong . okay . so , not the favourite animal , but i think i 'll draw elephant . project manager : industrial designer : i 'll try to draw elephant . it 's a problem . okay , thanks . okay so , elephant goes like this , and then it has four feet . i do n't know whether there 's any dist there should be any distance or not , but i think this is the easiest . and then we have it 's trunk . and yep something like this . project manager : industrial designer : an eye , cute . marketing : industrial designer : yeah , so project manager : poor elephant . industrial designer : and sometimes they have a hump . it seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking . so when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . when they 'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . that 's the way they walk . and that 's very peculiar about them . none of the other animals walk like this . and they are very useful to human beings . at least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful . and they are found in um usually the warm countries . and um they are the biggest terrestrial animal . that 's what i know about them . so , that 's what i wanted to tell about elephants . user interface : so is this uh an indian or an african elephant , 'cause you have n't drawn the ears ? industrial designer : there are two kind of uh yeah , they are very different , indian and african elephants . so indian elephant is having one bump , i think , and the african have two . and then there 's a difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are indian and so at some for some elephants it 's the trunk is having one do we have some message there ? project manager : yes . we have to i have to catch you , industrial designer : wind up project manager : sorry . we have to to go through the meeting . industrial designer : ? okay , some other time . user interface : okay . industrial designer : thank you . project manager : thank you . user interface : we can discuss that off-line . project manager : yeah we 'll discuss a f a fly or do we 'll do another meeting abo on elephants . industrial designer : thanks . project manager : so user interface : project manager : so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about so about finances . so we should target selling price of twenty-five euro for this remote control and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million euros , okay . and we should target the inter an international market . user interface : so could i just ask one question , um is this a stand-alone unit that we 're gon na be selling ? so it 's gon na be you already have a tv but you 're buying an extra remote control for it or something ? project manager : o this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , user interface : okay , alright . project manager : so let 's go to it . so um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go . should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? should it be a universal one ? and uh etcetera . so um so i 'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go . user interface : okay well , so , it seems the the first thing that they 've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wan na make , which seems to a kind of a little strange if we do n't know what the the product is yet , but i guess if that 's if that 's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , i guess we 're gon na need to find out what 's actually you know , what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they 're expecting for twenty-five euro project manager : okay . user interface : because it seems quite a lot for a remote control , project manager : okay i think this is more a job to our user interface : so it 's project manager : market person yeah . industrial designer : marketing person . user interface : yeah . project manager : so it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : so we need to close the meeting . uh we 'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do . so um you have to work on the on the working design , you have to uh work on the technical functions , and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ? marketing : yeah . project manager : um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual . thanks for coming today . user interface : okay . project manager : thanks . industrial designer : thanks ."
