    "answer": "user interface : so , that 's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . um , one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , marketing : user interface : so that you do n't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they 're not pressing the buttons while you 're trying to watch a tv show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : which is one of the things i really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . project manager : industrial designer : a hinge . be like a copper hinge or you know . project manager : user interface : yeah . but you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you do n't want it to start getting too heavy . industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm . user interface : but that 's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . as you can see , there 's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences ."
