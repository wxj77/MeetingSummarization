    "answer": "professor b : so the other , uh , aurora thing maybe is i i dunno if any of this is gon na come in in time to be relevant , but , uh , we had talked about , uh , { comment } guenter playing around , uh , uh , over in germany phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : and and , @ @ { comment } uh , possibly coming up with something that would , uh , uh , fit in later . uh , i saw that other mail where he said that he uh , it was n't going to work for him to do cvs . phd d : yeah . yeah . so now he has a version of the software . professor b : so he just has it all sitting there . yeah . phd d : yeah . um mm - hmm . professor b : so if he 'll he might work on improving the noise estimate or on some histogram things , or phd d : yeah . mm - hmm . professor b : yeah . i just saw the eurospeech we we did n't talk about it at our meeting but i just saw the just read the paper . someone , i forget the name , { comment } and and ney , uh , about histogram equalization ? did you see that one ? phd d : um , it was a poster . or professor b : yeah . i mean , i just read the paper . phd d : yeah . professor b : i did n't see the poster . phd d : yeah . um it was something similar to n on - line normalization finally i mean , in the idea of of normalizing professor b : yeah . but it 's a little more it it 's a little finer , right ? so they had like ten quantiles phd d : yeah . professor b : and and they adjust the distribution . phd d : right . professor b : so you you have the distributions from the training set , and then , uh so this is just a a histogram of of the amplitudes , i guess . right ? and then um , people do this in image processing some . phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : you have this kind of of histogram of of levels of brightness or whatever . and and and then , when you get a new new thing that you you want to adjust to be better in some way , you adjust it so that the histogram of the new data looks like the old data . you do this kind of piece - wise linear or , uh , some kind of piece - wise approximation . they did a uh one version that was piece - wise linear and another that had a power law thing between them between the points . and , uh , they said they s they sort of see it in a way as s for the speech case { comment } as being kind of a generalization of spectral subtraction in a way , because , you know , in spectral subtraction you 're trying to get rid of this excess energy . uh , you know , it 's not supposed to be there . uh and , uh , this is sort of adjusting it for for a lot of different levels . and then they have s they have some kind of , uh , a floor or something ,"
