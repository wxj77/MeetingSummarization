    "query": "<s> why was marketing discontent with all those changes made to buttons during the discussion about finance ?",
    "answer": "marketing : well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . industrial designer : yeah . okay . marketing : but then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who do n't even know what a scroll-wheel is . user interface : yeah . marketing : holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . industrial designer : marketing : with only five buttons on it . and a scroll-wheel . project manager : i think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . if you just make it real simple . because it saves it saves a lot of money . and we can keep our lcd screen , which can provide extra information . how to use the scroll wheel . how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . marketing : true . true . project manager : and it 's good for the innovative design as well . if you would erase these . mm eraser ? and we put uh looks a bit odd maybe . marketing : that 's a pretty big scroll wheel . project manager : that is something like that . marketing : project manager : then , yeah . we 've got the scroll-wheel . one , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . and these are two buttons then . industrial designer : we could make two buttons out of that . and just um if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so that would save two buttons . if you do the same for the channel . project manager : yeah . that 's really a good good idea , i think . and it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . industrial designer : more obvious . project manager : so we make one for the volume , one for the channel . plus scroll . that 's right . industrial designer : so if we project manager : so we 've got one , two , three . yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . that 's m that 's better . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . so marketing : so this is five buttons . industrial designer : if we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . and make it smaller overall . project manager : y yeah . industrial designer : so if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button project manager : mm yeah . uh yeah , and then you can industrial designer : you get a a much smaller remote . project manager : that 's right . user interface : uh yeah . industrial designer : and it sh project manager : so we can decrease this one to four buttons . industrial designer : yeah ? marketing : right now we have five . user interface : but uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . project manager : yeah . that 's no problem . user interface : just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . it uh it 's a bit uh project manager : yeah . yeah . it 's uh it 's more the moulds in which they are being made , i think . single curved is really easy to just fill in . and cases come right out of the machine . user interface : . project manager : and single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one . i think this is a really easy one . um , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? freek , what do you think ? marketing : well , i still think we should go for the single curve design . user interface : . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but then again , all these changes are not really okay with me . industrial designer : richard 's argument was very good . yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : but since we just have to . project manager : we have to cut costs . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah i 'm ag marketing : i 'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote . project manager : ask for more money . yeah . yeah . i am agreeing with the usability . yeah . marketing : or do some market research and see what the options are . project manager : yeah . but th um i think we can then keep the single curved one . just to express our lcd screen a bit more . marketing : yeah . project manager : so people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , user interface : yeah . project manager : it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . it will be necessary to have good help function , as well . so this is scroll . i think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . before we went on to the to the whole design . marketing : yes . definitely . user interface : the th project manager : but i 'm glad we could make a bit . marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one . marketing : it 's pretty different . user interface : marketing : but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . this will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . project manager : yeah . it will . yeah . user interface : but um"
