    "query": "<s> what did the professor think about the pragmatic overview of the project ?",
    "answer": "professor d : right . right , it does n't work . so , in a way , that 's , you know , that 's sort of the dominant thing is that even , say on the development set stuff that we saw , the , uh , the numbers that , uh , that alcatel was getting when choosing out the best single numbers , it was just you know , it was n't good enough for for a a for a real system . phd a : mmm . mm - hmm . professor d : you you you , um so , uh , we still have stuff to do . phd a : yeah . professor d : uh , and , uh i do n't know so , looking at the data , where , you know what 's the what 's what 's th what 's characteristic i e yeah , i think that 's that 's a good thing . does a any you have any thoughts about what else y you 're thinking that you did n't get to that you would like to do if you had more time ? uh phd e : oh , f a lot of thing . because we trying a lot of s thing , and we does n't work , we remove these . maybe we trying again with the articulatory feature . i do n't know exactly because we tried we some one experiment that does n't work . um , forgot it , something i do n't know exactly professor d : mm - hmm . phd e : because , tsk { comment } maybe do better some step the general , eh , diagram . professor d : mm - hmm . phd e : i do n't know exactly s to think what we can improve . professor d : yeah , cuz a lot of time it 's true , there were a lot of times when we 've tried something and it did n't work right away , even though we had an intuition that there should be something there . and so then we would just stop it . um and , uh , one of the things i do n't remember the details on , but i remember at some point , when you were working with a second stream , and you tried a low - pass filtering to cepstrum , in some case you got phd e : msg yeah . professor d : well , but it was { comment } an msg - like thing , but it was n't msg , right ? uh , you y i think in some case you got some little improvement , but it was , you know , sort of a small improvement , and it was a a big added complication , so you dropped it . but , um , that was just sort of one try , right ? you just took one filter , threw it there , phd a : yeah , professor d : right ? and it seems to me that , um , if that is an important idea , which , you know , might be , that one could work at it for a while , as you 're saying . and , uh uh , and you had , you know , you had the multi - band things also , and , you know , there was issue of that . phd a : yeah , professor d : um , barry 's going to be , uh , continuing working on multi - band things as well . phd e : mm - hmm . professor d : we were just talking about , um , some , uh , some work that we 're interested in . kind of inspired by the stuff by larry saul with the , uh uh , learning articulatory feature in i think , in the case of his paper with sonorance based on , uh , multi - band information where you have a a combination of gradient learning an and , uh , em . phd a : mm - hmm . professor d : um , and um , so , i think that , you know , this is a , uh this is a neat data set . um , and then , uh , as we mentioned before , we also have the the new , uh , digit set coming up from recordings in this room . so , there 's a lot of things to work with . um and , uh what i like about it , in a way , is that , uh , the results are still so terrible . uh uh i mean , they 're much better than they were , you know . we 're talking about thirty to sixty percent , uh , error rate reduction . that 's that 's really great stuff to to do that in relatively short time . but even after that it 's still , you know , so poor that that , uh , no one could really use it . so , um i think that 's great that because and y also because again , it 's not something sometimes we 've gotten terrible results by taking some data , and artificially , you know , convolving it with some room response , or something we take a very uh , at one point , uh , brian and i went downstairs into the the basement where it was it was in a hallway where it was very reverberant and we we made some recordings there . and then we we , uh uh , made a simulation of the of the room acoustics there and and applied it to other things , phd a : mm - hmm . professor d : and uh but it was all pretty artificial , and and , you know , how often would you really try to have your most crucial conversations in this very reverberant hallway ? um so , uh this is what 's nice about the aurora data and the data here , is that is that it 's sort of a realistic room situation uh , acoustics acoustic situation , both terms in noise and reflections , and so on and n n and , uh , uh , with something that 's still relatively realistic , it 's still very very hard to do very well . so yeah . phd a : yeah , so d well actually , this is tha that 's why we well , it 's a different kind of data . we 're not we 're not used to work with this kind of data . that 's why we should have a loo more closer look at what 's going on ."
