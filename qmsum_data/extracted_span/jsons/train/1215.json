    "query": "<s> what did kirsty williams think about swansea university when discussing the admission problems of wales universities and corresponding solutions ?",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : as i said in answer to your question earlier , there is a difference reflected in the exposure of institutions to eu and international students . i would argue that it 's not necessarily the case that institutions that are not high-tariff are not able to do very well in this sector . if you look , for instance , at swansea university\u2014if you look at the work swansea university has done , that shows you what is possible . hefin david am : what is swansea 's success , then ? what can we learn from swansea ? kirsty williams am : what i think is important\u2014and this is not about any one institution\u2014what i think is really important is that we look to\u2014 . and i ca n't force institutions to do this . it 's a combination , i believe , for all universities , of getting their offer right\u2014so , having a curriculum at their institution that is attractive and offers courses that people want to study . it 's about that curriculum being delivered in an excellent fashion , so high quality ratings for teaching , as well as having an infrastructure that is attractive to students . so , it 's all about getting the offer right and providing what students , both domestically and internationally , want . hefin david am : but the evidence would therefore suggest that that model of success that you 've just outlined is happening in swansea but it is n't happening in other institutions , and they 're seeing a drop . kirsty williams am : well , as i said , i think what we can see from cardiff , swansea and others is that it is possible to do very well in the sector . hefin david am : so , cardiff , swansea and bangor\u2014but the others , not ."
