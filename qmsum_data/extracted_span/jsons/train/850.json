    "answer": "grad a : um , i guess , jerry needs to enter marks , but i do n't know if he 's gon na do that now or later . but , uh , if he 's gon na enter marks , it 's gon na take him awhile , i guess , and he wo n't be here . grad c : and what 's nancy doing ? grad a : nancy ? um , she was sorta finishing up the , uh , calculation of marks and assigning of grades , but i do n't know if she should be here . well or , she should be free after that , so assuming she 's coming to this meeting . i do n't know if she knows about it . grad c : she 's on the email list , right ? grad a : is she ? ok . grad b : mm - hmm . ok . because basically , what where we also have decided , prior to this meeting is that we would have a rerun of the three of us sitting together sometime this week again and finish up the , uh , values of this . so we have , uh believe it or not , we have all the bottom ones here . grad c : well , i grad d : you added a bunch of nodes , for ? grad b : yep . we we we have actually what we have is this line . right ? grad c : uh , what do the , uh , structures do ? so the the the for instance , this location node 's got two inputs , grad a : four inputs . grad c : that one you grad b : four . grad a : those are the bottom things are inputs , also . grad c : oh , i see . grad a : yeah . grad c : ok , that was ok . that makes a lot more sense to me now . cuz i thought it was like , that one in stuart 's book about , you know , the grad a : alarm in the dog ? grad c : u yeah . grad a : yeah . grad c : or the earthquake and the alarm . grad a : sorry . yeah , i 'm confusing two . grad c : yeah , there 's a dog one , too , but that 's in java bayes , grad a : right . grad c : is n't it ? grad a : maybe . grad c : but there 's something about bowel problems or something with the dog . grad a : yeah . grad b : and we have all the top ones , all the ones to which no arrows are pointing . what we 're missing are the these , where arrows are pointing , where we 're combining top ones . so , we have to come up with values for this , and this , this , this , and so forth . and maybe just fiddle around with it a little bit more . and , um . and then it 's just , uh , edges , many of edges . and , um , we wo n't { comment } meet next monday . so . grad c : cuz of memorial day ? grad a : we 'll meet next tuesday , i guess . grad b : yep . yeah . grad c : when 's jerry leaving for italia ? grad b : on on friday . grad a : which friday ? grad b : this this friday . grad d : oh . this friday ? grad b : this friday . grad c : as in , four days ? or , three days ? grad a : is he how long is he gone for ? grad b : two weeks . grad a : italy , huh ? what 's , uh what 's there ? grad b : well , it 's a country . buildings . people . grad a : pasta . grad c : but it 's not a conference or anything . he 's just visiting . grad a : right . just visiting . grad b : vacation . grad a : it 's a pretty nice place , in my brief , uh , encounter with it . grad b : do you guys oh , yeah . so . part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when when he comes back . um , so grad c : oh , i think we should disappoint him . grad b : yeah ? you or have a finished construction parser and a working belief - net , and uh grad c : that would n't be disappointing . i think w we should do absolutely no work for the two weeks that he 's gone . grad b : well , that 's actually what i had planned , personally . i had i i had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guys do a lot of work , and i do nothing . and then , i sort of grad c : oh , yeah , that sounds good , too . grad b : sort of bask in in your glory . but , uh , i do you guys have any vacation plans , because i myself am going to be , um , gone , but this is actually not really important . just this weekend we 're going camping . grad c : yeah , i 'm wan na be this gone this weekend , too . grad b : ah . but we 're all going to be here on tuesday again ? looks like it ? grad d : yeah . grad b : ok , then . let 's meet meet again next tuesday . and , um , finish up this bayes - net . and once we have finished it , i guess we can , um and that 's going to be more just you and me , because bhaskara is doing probabilistic , recursive , structured , object - oriented , uh , grad c : killing machines ! grad b : reasoning machines . and , um grad c : killing , reasoning . what 's the difference ? grad d : wait . so you 're saying , next tuesday , is it the whole group meeting , or just us three working on it , or or ? grad b : uh . the whole group . and we present our results , our final , definite grad d : so , when you were saying we need to do a re - run of , like grad a : h what ? grad d : what like , just working out the rest of the grad b : yeah . we should do this th the upcoming days . grad d : this week ? grad b : so , this week , yeah . grad c : when you say , `` the whole group `` , you mean the four of us , and keith ? grad b : and , ami might . grad c : ami might be here , and it 's possible that nancy 'll be here ? so , yeah . grad b : because , th you know , once we have the belief - net done grad c : you 're just gon na have to explain it to me , then , on tuesday , how it 's all gon na work out . you know . grad b : we will . ok . because then , once we have it sort of up and running , then we can start you know , defining the interfaces and then feed stuff into it and get stuff out of it , and then hook it up to some fake construction parser and grad c : that you will have in about nine months or so . grad b : yeah . grad c : yeah . grad b : and , um , grad c : the first bad version 'll be done in nine months . grad b : yeah , i can worry about the ontology interface and you can keith can worry about the discourse . i mean , this is pretty um , i mean , i i i hope everybody uh knows that these are just going to be uh dummy values , right ? grad a : which grad b : where the grad a : which ones ? grad b : s so so if the endpoint if the go - there is yes and no , then go - there - discourse will just be fifty - fifty . right ? grad a : um , what do you mean ? if the go - there says no , then the go - there is grad d : i do n't get it . grad a : i do n't u understand . like , the go - there depends on all those four things . yeah . grad b : but , what are the values of the go - there - discourse ? grad a : well , it depends on the situation . if the discourse is strongly indicating that"
