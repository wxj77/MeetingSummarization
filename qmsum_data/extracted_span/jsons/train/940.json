    "answer": "grad e : yeah . yeah , hopefully , i mean the mixed signal , the overlaps are pretty audible because it is volume equalized . so i think they should be able to hear . the only problem is is , you know , counting how many and if they 're really correct or not . so , i do n't know . phd d : i do n't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal , grad e : right but but once once you know that they happen , you can at least listen to the close talking , phd d : but you would know that they were there , and then you would switch . right . and then you would switch into the other professor c : but right now , to do this limitation , the switching is going to be switching of the audio ? is what she 's saying . postdoc a : yeah . grad e : right . professor c : so grad e : right , so so professor c : so they 're using their ears to do these markings anyway . grad e : did dave did dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu to listen to the individual channels ? postdoc a : yes . yes . phd d : yeah . postdoc a : click um , grad e : i had suggested it before . i just do n't know whether he did it or not . postdoc a : i 'm not sure what click what click on the ribbon ? yeah , you can get that grad e : yeah . postdoc a : oh , oh , get you can get the , uh you can get it to switch audio ? uh , not last i tried , grad e : yeah . postdoc a : but , um , maybe he 's changed it again . grad e : we should get him to do that because , uh , i think that would be much , much faster than going to the menu . postdoc a : i disagree . there 's a reason i disagree , and that is that , uh , you it 's very good to have a dissociation between the visual and the audio . there 're times when i wan na hear the mixed signal , bu but i want to transcribe on the single channel . so right now"
