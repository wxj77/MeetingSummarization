project manager : 'kay . can we get started industrial designer : no what was it about ? project manager : or is there some pressing issue ? industrial designer : yeah my computer is not functioning properly . project manager : oh no pressing . user interface : marketing : project manager : did you plug in the power cable when you come back ? industrial designer : yeah yeah . no but my screen is reduced in size . project manager : yeah . that 's difficult . yeah . user interface : marketing : what ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : industrial designer : feedback . user interface : okay . project manager : industrial designer : okay . marketing : alt delete . project manager : yeah . user interface : format . project manager : format save . marketing : . so it does n't draw the attention away . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : this is dreadful . user interface : i made uh uh my own map . project manager : oh yeah sure . industrial designer : no not this , but the task . user interface : it 's a project manager : you have playstation also ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . no that 's okay . no i just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened . ah . uh where was it ? in settings ? okay . alright . thank you . do you guys like your tasks ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i spent a lot of time thinking about what i was gon na do and then a couple of minutes before this i get my function you know the information that i need . user interface : yeah wa wa you actually yeah . but it it 's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation . industrial designer : so frustrating . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so marketing : yeah . i i had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . i have to do that so switch . industrial designer : yeah yeah exactly . this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause i had n't time to intergrate tha the information yet so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : really annoying . project manager : okay . so there we are again . marketing : by your humble p_m_ . project manager : yeah . marketing : project manager : okay this is the agenda . um we have three presentations , i heard . marketing : user interface : really . project manager : yeah really . so who wants to start ? marketing : yeah that 's fine . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : we have to start it right away ? project manager : yeah . uh this is you ? marketing : functional ? yeah functional requirements . project manager : 'kay . marketing : alright . i 'm gon na talk about functional requirements . um well uh some research has be done uh has been done . uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . uh and they also filled in a questionnaire . the findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . they disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . users think they 're ugly . um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . so they they d they do n't match what they want to have on it . um they are often lost somewhere in the room . um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . and they 're bad for r_s_i_ . i do n't know uh how a user can reach that but okay . um there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . um but they are used . i mean the industrial designer : so they do need to be in the project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control . industrial designer : alright . marketing : i mean if you ca n't control the the sound settings i mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that . project manager : often . marketing : so um yeah we have to . industrial designer : by the way my tv does n't have an equ equaliser but marketing : we c we c yeah i mean w we ca n't project manager : next generation does . industrial designer : okay . marketing : my my tv has , industrial designer : no . alright . marketing : but we we can leave them uh away . uh most relevant , uh most used functions , uh they speak for themselves i guess . uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . uh teletext but we can skip that because i saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it 's i should not be used uh any more in the future . project manager : n not used anymore . marketing : so forget this one . user interface : okay . marketing : uh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : by the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? user interface : yeah . i was wondering uh industrial designer : i did n't get anything . marketing : yeah , on on the project uh project manager : yeah . not by mail . i receiv the mail but you do n't . so user interface : but you you 've got more information than uh . marketing : no so it 's a text file n in the project folder . so teletext can be skipped . project manager : that 's in the presentation , so industrial designer : alright . marketing : um there was some research on new features in a remote control . uh about an lcd screen uh and speech recognition . well we got an update for the for the audience . or the the the targeted group . so it 's above forty i guess . project manager : uh below i believe . marketing : the new product ? or below project manager : yeah below forty . marketing : because that 's pretty relevant . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : i thought i read a project manager : our current customers are in the age group forty plus . marketing : yeah ? project manager : and the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . marketing : below ? okay well user interface : but where did you get uh that information ? project manager : that 's in a newsflash . marketing : that 's that 's in the newsfla project manager : user interface : okay . marketing : okay that 's a good to know . um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features . user interface : yeah . marketing : i mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . so i think we can build that in . um yeah well we can skip this part as well , because i thought i read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . um and and also there 's so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . so the physical uh aspect of it . um and i think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control in your room . user interface : yeah . marketing : it 's it 's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . so it 's the people can say , well what 's that , well that 's my remote control , so it 's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh project manager : yeah . but it also needs to have corporate identity . marketing : yeah so the the logo has to be project manager : present and the colours . marketing : uh present yeah , and the colours as well . project manager : so we ca n't change much of that . industrial designer : do we have uh yeah . marketing : yeah so but i i do n't think that 's that 's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it . project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . yeah . yeah . marketing : so i think that 's not gon na gon na affect it very uh very much . project manager : okay . marketing : well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : alright . user interface : okay . project manager : it 's open already so you can use to marketing : . project manager : find yours . user interface : mm . it 's project manager : f_ five . user interface : f_ five . okay . project manager : go jurgen . user interface : oh . what is this ? marketing : user interface : oh no . industrial designer : user interface : how do i uh project manager : you pressed alt f_ four ? user interface : no no no . i pressed the mouse button . project manager : oh great . user interface : industrial designer : it 's th that 's the self-destruct button . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . okay . project manager : uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . user interface : okay . um if you all go stand around uh marketing : yeah . just yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : computer industrial designer : alright . marketing : sure . user interface : um project manager : that 's nice . f_ five . yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : okay . marketing : alright . user interface : i uh had uh two examples . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : this the easy one marketing : yeah . user interface : i think we have to to combine them . and uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . user interface : um but yeah the the age is uh under forty ? project manager : the mm yeah . marketing : yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions . user interface : so we okay so so we have the option for more functions . marketing : so not not too much but yeah . user interface : um yeah . industrial designer : and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech marketing : and the speech recognition yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : alright . user interface : uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids . it 's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options . but marketing : yeah from age of sixteen so yeah . user interface : yeah but i prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . we have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : but if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option . marketing : yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . user interface : okay one device . project manager : yeah . so n it 's very easy . user interface : okay . i did n't see . project manager : now yeah it 's okay . user interface : okay and i also uh yeah . w yeah . marketing : so there are not extra options in this case , but uh project manager : okay . user interface : we have to make it fashionable . like you uh said uh before . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : uh yeah the basic functions . um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed . project manager : yeah so maybe you can hide them or something . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . project manager : yeah you make a screen menu or something . marketing : and the and the yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and then the basic function just on the device itself . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu . project manager : yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen . user interface : yeah . project manager : what does the screen do ? user interface : did i uh industrial designer : alright . marketing : uh . what are wh project manager : yeah . it 's low power . user interface : did i break it ? marketing : what . project manager : so what does the screen do ? they said they needed it but what does it do ? what do they want with the screen ? user interface : for for the advanced functions i think . project manager : yeah that 's what we make it up . marketing : yeah well it yeah it did n't project manager : so but what did the marketing marketing : it did n't say what they want to do with the screen . well i , my guess is it 's it 's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions . project manager : yeah okay it 's handy . with no predefined uh user interface : like searching for channels and industrial designer : ah look . marketing : yeah searching for channels , programming them . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we have your uh oh never mind . project manager : we 're back online . user interface : okay . that 's uh i 'm al i 'm almost finished so project manager : okay . user interface : um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . so we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable project manager : mm-hmm . content and form . user interface : yeah content and form . industrial designer : . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : now that that was uh was the end . project manager : that was the end . okay . industrial designer : okay . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : well my presentation is a bit uh sucky . marketing : well you can improvise right ? project manager : uh which one is it ? technical functions ? industrial designer : yeah a little bit . project manager : this one ? industrial designer : uh no . no no . project manager : functional requirements ? industrial designer : yeah i think that would be it then . user interface : project manager : you did n't put it in ? or industrial designer : i have no idea . marketing : so we we can go for industrial designer : that w . project manager : it 's not really english . industrial designer : let me check . i know . project manager : uh kick off . oh working design i got it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it . project manager : here you go . industrial designer : alright how do i uh skip pages ? project manager : just uh press uh yeah . yeah . industrial designer : the keys yeah ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : alright . um yeah well i was working on this before i got my information . so i was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : industrial designer : and well the info on the website which came too late . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um so i did n't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . those were my uh starting points . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh i was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and i was supposed to do it like this . but um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that i had to follow , so i was trying to organise them for myself . project manager : marketing : industrial designer : and then make the project manager : design yeah . industrial designer : the design , a the actual design , marketing : design ? yeah . industrial designer : but i never came around to do that . so i 'm not really sure what i 'm supposed to say about it . marketing : okay . industrial designer : i mean everything speaks for itself i guess . mean you press a button um the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah frequency . yeah . industrial designer : and uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . and then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the tv project manager : yeah decoder . industrial designer : and the tv will translate it into a function . um yeah well this was actually all i got around to do . project manager : blank . yeah okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i mean i dunno if i 'm too slow for this stuff , but uh project manager : work harder . marketing : user interface : okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh marketing : industrial designer : yeah . whatever . project manager : yeah . uh marketing : yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it . user interface : yeah . project manager : 'kay . um for those that did n't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for tv . uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , but i do n't think it 's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well . and uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . and we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let 's see what was it , uh the target group . we have to make be clear what that is . marketing : group of users , or project manager : yeah users . marketing : because it says below forty i mean . project manager : yeah so i think it 's easy but marketing : i guess that 's that 's the tar yeah uh or male and female user interface : but uh it 's it 's also for children or just uh project manager : yeah it 's below forty so we can decide where to marketing : uh six the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . user interface : okay . okay . marketing : sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . project manager : okay . so below forty is okay . marketing : so um project manager : but we need an lower level which to s uh focus . marketing : how do you mean ? project manager : so is it from sixteen to forty ? is it from twenty to forty ? is it from thirty ? marketing : uh sixteen to forty . project manager : yeah ? 'kay . user interface : yeah . we we have to marketing : well i i guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology . project manager : yeah . marketing : so they they adapt to it pretty soon i guess . user interface : and if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah so what we might wan na do is uh yeah cust i have customised the screen functions , if you know what i mean . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : the uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . but maybe elderly people do n't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . project manager : design . mm . industrial designer : and yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . user interface : yeah that 's that 's why uh i wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . the the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . and maybe y industrial designer : experienced yeah . marketing : but uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ? user interface : na i w i should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . project manager : yeah . marketing : like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ? project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . so is you should have a menu for all the the functions you do n't use regular and which are marketing : uh you can make a if you make a drawing . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . aye yeah . marketing : uh uh . project manager : shall i uh marketing : uh black 's okay . and draw it very big . project manager : yeah . it 's okay . marketing : oh . yeah . project manager : no , it does n't have line control , so marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah we get the marketing : yeah well , this is basically uh it 's industrial designer : the remote ? project manager : the remote , yeah ? marketing : alright the remote ? um well usually the power button is on top i guess . project manager : basic . is on top . which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . marketing : yeah so it should fit right in into your hand . user interface : yeah . l left top or right uh top ? project manager : t i s should said right . marketing : right . right . user interface : yeah , right . industrial designer : right top . marketing : i most people are right-handed so user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah definitely . marketing : maybe left-handed special addition , but okay . user interface : marketing : if you put it like like here . or something . i dunno . um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top i guess . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah . project manager : do the also with the thumb . so it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . marketing : okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . project manager : you you need to be able to hold it so user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : okay for example if you put the screen here , it 's more about the functions now than the than the layout . project manager : yeah okay that 's true . layout . that 's for the marketing : does n't work too well . it 's uh it 's bent . project manager : user interface : project manager : i ca n't help it . marketing : . user interface : you broke it . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : . project manager : man . marketing : right . project manager : yeah okay . marketing : okay you get it . uh for example if y if you put all the project manager : marketing : right . project manager : you want the normal piece of paper ? and you have a pen ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and might be easier huh ? marketing : maybe this . kind of works . project manager : yeah ? marketing : like if you have like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels , project manager : mm-hmm . uh . marketing : um and here one for for project manager : and the for flipping up and down . user interface : yeah yeah . and volume control . marketing : yeah that that usually uh like here , here , here , here . industrial designer : yeah i project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume uh project manager : and left to right . and those can also be used for the menu . industrial designer : yeah exactly . i thought but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things marketing : and you you have industrial designer : and marketing : most of the time you have one button in the middle . it says menu , industrial designer : yeah okay . project manager : for the menu . yeah . marketing : and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and then just project manager : yeah . marketing : mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action . project manager : yeah . marketing : so you scroll into it , okay . you select a function like v like uh bass . you just adjust it with these two buttons . project manager : yeah . marketing : then okay to confirm , and then uh on on each on each screen there 's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : and then finally say okay , exit . or or one button to exit it . user interface : yeah . marketing : uh in one time i dunno , that 's not really my department . user interface : and do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or marketing : that 's more your uh your department to to uh to project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , user interface : on the left uh top yeah . marketing : yeah . i mean it 's uh project manager : yeah but that depends on where you put the screen . user interface : okay . project manager : but it 's essential that there is a screen . marketing : yeah . yeah i mean the position of the screen is also more essential than i mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . project manager : yeah . and for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone . marketing : but um yeah so it should be i mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe . project manager : yeah . this would be uh industrial designer : why did we wan na put the display in the bottom ? marketing : i mean i project manager : no that 's not s sure so industrial designer : okay . marketing : that 's not sure project manager : uh we need a display . marketing : but it 's user interface : yeah may maybe because you 're industrial designer : because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display . user interface : yeah okay but only for the basic functi if you 're going to use the advanced option , you 're going to press the the menu button and then yeah . marketing : yeah i mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . industrial designer : normal for logical t project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . project manager : yeah they 're used to it . user interface : okay the yeah . that 's possible . marketing : so you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i mean if you grab it . industrial designer : on once it 's on it 's on . you do n't need the power button . marketing : but most most of the times if a if if a tv 's on standby people just press a channel to put it on . user interface : yeah , okay . okay we put it on top . marketing : so we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo user interface : yeah . marketing : like over here . r_r_ . and j and the microphone , i mean it can be very small . if you look at your mobile phones are some stripes , little little holes . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : maybe on the top or even on the side . project manager : marketing : yeah maybe on the side . i mean if the if the microphone is good . project manager : yeah but then it 's possible that you cover it with your hand so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : true . marketing : yeah okay . so on the on the top is better . project manager : i think that top is the best option . industrial designer : but if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side project manager : yeah okay . industrial designer : i dunno . should be able to work . marketing : yeah . . project manager : depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but i think that 's okay . industrial designer : never mind . can we leave this up to you ? user interface : marketing : yeah it does n't matter that much . so but um the screen is on top ? which functions did we have left ? i mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down . project manager : volume . up . channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options . marketing : screen is over there . project manager : so maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the lcd screen . user interface : yeah . if we marketing : yeah . yeah . that 's uh that 's a good one . industrial designer : yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right ? project manager : yeah so sounds ? industrial designer : like uh bass uh marketing : yeah . sound ? industrial designer : so we need kind of an equaliser . if you marketing : yeah . equaliser . so if you have sound but not too advanced . i mean most tvs use only treble and bass . user interface : yeah it it 's just a remote control so project manager : and they 're industrial designer : yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something . project manager : they 're not used often so user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . it 's uh pretty hard to write . project manager : industrial designer : ah as project manager : yeah just industrial designer : . marketing : mm . okay but you have sound ? project manager : yeah sounds . marketing : yeah just project manager : yeah . marketing : oh y you have digital uh industrial designer : . marketing : better write it down over there yeah . project manager : of course . i 'm just a secretary . marketing : so you have sound . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : coffee ? marketing : uh yeah sound and then within sound i guess treble and bass ? industrial designer : yes please . project manager : treble bass . industrial designer : the mono stereo option ? marketing : yeah . also . project manager : uh industrial designer : and there there was something else also . project manager : pitch i believe , yeah . industrial designer : and then pitch . marketing : pitch . yeah . but pitch , is n't that yeah that 's the the height of the tone . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the fr yeah the frequency of the tones , yeah . marketing : yeah okay , project manager : yeah and mono stereo . marketing : wh why would you use that ? industrial designer : yeah is n't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you 're watching . marketing : if people like talk like uh yeah . project manager : and also the tuning part ? marketing : programming part . project manager : yeah programming . so channel programming ? marketing : uh so we have sound , yeah ? channel programming . industrial designer : and yeah in the functionality of the user interface : television uh itself uh industrial designer : no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them ? as a confirmation or whatever you know ? i dunno . marketing : i think it g it gets annoying . project manager : yeah . marketing : i mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but user interface : we we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s industrial designer : under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things . user interface : yeah . but uh the the television itself has also the the options brightness and uh screen colour etcetera . so marketing : yeah . project manager : contrast yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah but people do n't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it 's very hard to project manager : mm . no . uh , so contrast , marketing : y yeah contrast and brightness ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : bright , marketing : yeah those are the most used i guess . if you look at your monitor . project manager : uh and the others were in your presentation right ? so i can just copy those ? marketing : well yeah well i guess that these were the only ones , i guess . project manager : okay . it 's easy . industrial designer : but so we have we have tv options , which is all this . marketing : yeah . i will look it up . project manager : yeah the button options and the lcd options . industrial designer : the sound , sound and image . and you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options . project manager : indeed . marketing : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so we need two menus kind of thing . project manager : yeah you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . industrial designer : uh-huh . project manager : and the lcd options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah . marketing : yeah with the chip and then i mean project manager : so you you have an additional processor and and software part . marketing : uh yeah . well yeah we have power button , whether that 's present . project manager : compared to o industrial designer : alright . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : channel volume selection present . uh numbers present . yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . screen settings , brightness and colour . project manager : l_ s yeah . colour . yeah i i call it contrast . marketing : yeah con contrast is project manager : yeah i make it c colour . marketing : yeah okay , colour and brightness . project manager : yeah . marketing : um and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? so you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your tv . and then you can um project manager : yeah and automatically um mm-hmm . marketing : uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it . project manager : yeah so i 've g channel program is autoseek ? marketing : yeah , autoseek . project manager : uh name a channel , or marketing : well most tvs automatically display the name , which they get through the cable . project manager : oh they get automatic names , okay . marketing : yeah . so you only have to choose the position on your project manager : . marketing : it only has to match the the channel frequency on your tv , with with the with the position on your tv and and so your remote . project manager : yeah . yeah but can you also say i want f uh veronica on the channel number uh five or industrial designer : help . marketing : if you already programmed it . project manager : yeah . marketing : if you want to move it . yeah that should be possible too . project manager : yeah . how do you call that ? marketing : yeah how do you call that ? mm ? wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . project manager : channels ? yeah . marketing : i mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever . project manager : ninety nine or something . yeah . marketing : just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed . project manager : s swap channels ? can i call it that ? marketing : yeah . swap channels . project manager : swap 's good option . okay . uh other functions ? marketing : so you most of the time if you if you swap it s uh let 's say for example you have uh r_t_l_ five on on channel five . and veronica on channel eight and you want to move veronica to channel five , most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one . project manager : mm-hmm . okay . well that 's 's up to uh mister user interface designer . user interface : marketing : yeah . it 's it 's pretty uh user interface : okay . marketing : yeah i mean you have to look on on the menu industrial designer : working design . doch . project manager : also . marketing : on the tv . project manager : that 's you 're industrial designer : he only has to figure out how it has to look . project manager : yeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ? industrial designer : and how user interface : yeah . industrial designer : to use project manager : and the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as i believe . industrial designer : yeah okay . but you did your homework . but um yeah . okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : marketing : or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ? to programme the channels ? project manager : no i do n't think so . industrial designer : no no . it should be able to do any remote . user interface : no that 's project manager : but i think the communication with the television is difficult . but that 's not our part . marketing : yeah . project manager : we do n't have to design a protocol so marketing : that 's true . that 's true . industrial designer : thank god . user interface : okay marketing : yeah . so we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily . i mean th the autoseek is is not a problem . project manager : no that 's the marketing : i mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says , uh on which number do you want to save this , and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it 's it 's saved . it 's easier , it 's it 's it 's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap . project manager : yeah . so but marketing : so we have to think of something for that . project manager : um the user interface designer can design a menu for all these function i put them on the marketing : yeah k kind of structure into layers . user interface : on the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the yeah 'cause it 's now there are lots and lots of documents project manager : . yeah . yeah i can . user interface : and project manager : i 'll just try to reorganise uh things . um marketing : so project manager : so you design the basic function menu for the lcd screen ? uh um i think marketing : and and the layout of of the thing itself . project manager : th i think the yeah the layout of the screen user interface : the the layout of the remote control ? project manager : and i think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the marketing : . user interface : is n't that more the the u uh the user interface part ? project manager : . no i d i think that 's more in . industrial designer : uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote i think are in my department . marketing : maybe more on project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i have to know what it has to do , so if you wan na you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , i have to integrate that in the design . project manager : okay . so he 's layout and you 're function . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : form function okay . industrial designer : i think that 's a that 's a good separation . marketing : okay . user interface : but do i have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also ? or project manager : yeah . user interface : are you going to do that ? marketing : yeah . yeah i guess so . user interface : yeah ? i i 'm going to make project manager : i think i that 's your department yes , user interface : yeah o okay . project manager : because w he already knows what industrial designer : yeah we have to kind of work together . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : if if i make the the the yeah the menu like , i have to state which function has to be in the menu , project manager : but we 're not allowed . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : and then you have to decide , it 's , in a in a way that b is user-friendly . user interface : yeah . okay . y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and i 'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with pages and yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i think yeah . marketing : with with some l with some layers in it . project manager : yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , marketing : so some menus . project manager : because that 's always the difficulty . marketing : yeah . project manager : every device has its own user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . well i guess this this button , the the the okay , project manager : menu okay . marketing : menu okay . or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons . uh like uh for your mobile phone . um so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it . and then one to confirm , and one to go one step back . project manager : back . yeah . marketing : so it 's like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have a nokia or like that . or the or the no button . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : to go one step back you it 's only two extra buttons , user interface : yeah . w we marketing : but if it if it 's very clear that they are for the screen user interface : uh i think we have to to group , to make two groups . um the one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , and industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah but they 're incorporated ? up and down is user interface : yeah okay but we we have a m marketing : yeah because this this is used for both . user interface : yeah but maybe that 's that 's not uh project manager : smart ? user interface : yeah if you 're if you 're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display . marketing : into your screen . okay . so you industrial designer : you wan na separate uh marketing : l should leave the menu button out of here . user interface : yeah . marketing : and and just put it under the screen , the screen project manager : put it on top . user interface : yeah j just just group group the yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so we make a yeah a line between them . marketing : yeah . but we should place the screen on top , right ? project manager : well user interface : f oh yeah . okay yeah we swap uh okay . project manager : but that 's uh j jurgen 's department . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . so we make it a marketing : yeah . you just you just find out and . project manager : you just make the layout . you user interface : okay . project manager : do we do the extra two buttons or not ? user interface : uh industrial designer : i think you should . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : it 's easier . if you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing . project manager : yeah okay . that 's true . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . so we have a a menu button and a s project manager : and to , okay and back , also . user interface : okay . okay and back button . marketing : yeah . yeah , or confirm and back . whatever . project manager : and of course the four arrows . marketing : yeah . project manager : but those are still y doubly used . both the lcd marketing : should we save this picture , or or you know what it looks like ? user interface : yeah i 'm i 'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons . we have a menu button and project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . that that just to to activate the screen . so user interface : that 's the the one with the yeah okay . project manager : menu button access the menu in the lcd screen . marketing : and then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate . project manager : you can navigate . user interface : okay . project manager : but you can also navigate the channels . and the volume . user interface : okay so that that 's not uh yeah that those are project manager : those are both both user interface : multifunctional . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : hey is it interesting for users if we put led lights under the buttons ? so that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up . marketing : yeah . l l litten up yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : oh five minutes . marketing : that 's very good idea . alright . project manager : light uh marketing : yeah that 's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use . industrial designer : yeah and then it 's also easier to integrate several functions in one button . project manager : yeah sure . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : um marketing : so project manager : anything else ? marketing : those buttons are are lit up . industrial designer : i think not . marketing : but just one thing . should we use those two ? them ? or only this to to scroll ? project manager : i 've marketing : and then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ? oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars ? project manager : volume . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu . marketing : yeah . and maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still . and then just only a back button . project manager : well we have those buttons . we use all four . user interface : no industrial designer : the pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , sorry project manager : yeah okay go ahead . marketing : yeah ? industrial designer : sorry , uh is uh if you 're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you 're not already at your choice . user interface : yeah . so maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah that was already decided . marketing : and one back . user interface : yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh yeah m a multifunctional navigation button . project manager : okay that 's what we decided earlier on . user interface : yeah okay . yeah . project manager : right okay . so marketing : yeah . industrial designer : you wan na close down huh ? project manager : yeah i wan na close down . user interface : project manager : i have to , sorry . marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's not because i do n't like you but marketing : yeah . industrial designer : that 's okay . project manager : yh we have lunch break , industrial designer : already . project manager : and then we can work for thirty minutes , and i have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . and then uh we 'll see marketing : yeah . industrial designer : alright . how m how long is the lunchbreak ?
