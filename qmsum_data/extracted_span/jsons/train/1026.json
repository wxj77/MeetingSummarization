    "query": "<s> what did professor c say about the possible hypothesis ?",
    "answer": "phd e : yeah . professor c : and then , given that as a base , you can see if that gets improved , you know , or or or worsened by the looking at regular energy , looking at log energy , we were just proposing that maybe it 's you know , it 's harder to see with the log energy , um and uh also these different normalizations , does a particular choice of normalization make it better ? phd e : yeah . professor c : but i had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on , that you look at scatter plots because that 's looking at a distribution in two dimensions . let 's start off just in one , uh , with this feature . phd e : yeah . yeah . professor c : i think that 's probably the most basic thing , before anything very complicated . phd e : yeah . professor c : um and then we w i think we 're agreed that pitch - related things are are are going to be a a really likely candidate to help . phd d : yeah . phd e : yeah . i agree , yeah . uh - huh . professor c : um but since uh your intuition from looking at some of the data , is that when you looked at the regular energy , that it did in fact usually go up , when two people were talking , that 's eh you know , you should be able to come up with a measure which will match your intuition . phd e : ok . yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah , yeah . professor c : and she 's right , that a that having a having { comment } having this table , with a whole bunch of things , with the standard deviation , the variance and so forth , it 's it 's it 's harder to interpret than just looking at the the same kind of picture you have here . phd e : but uh - huh . yeah . but it it 's curious but uh i f i found it in the in the mixed file , in one channel that eh in several oh e eh several times eh you have an speaker talking alone with a high level of energy professor c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd e : eh in the middle eh a zone of overlapping with mmm less energy professor c : mm - hmm . phd e : and eh come with another speaker with high energy professor c : mm - hmm . phd e : and the overlapping zone has eh less energy . professor c : yeah . so there 'll be some cases for which phd e : because there reach very many professor c : but , the qu so so they 'll be phd d : right . professor c : this is i w want to point to visual things , but i mean they there 'll be time there 'll be overlap between the distributions , but the question is , `` if it 's a reasonable feature at all , there 's some separation . `` phd e : yeah . yeah . phd d : especially locally . professor c : mm - hmm . phd d : so . locally . phd e : just locally , yeah . grad a : and i was just going to say that that right now we 're just exploring . phd d : and the other thing is i sorry . i grad a : what you would imagine eventually , is that you 'll feed all of these features into some discriminative system . phd e : yeah . professor c : yeah . grad a : and so even if if one of the features does a good job at one type of overlap , another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap . phd e : yeah . yeah . yeah . professor c : right . i mean the the reason i had suggested the scatter f p features is i used to do this a lot , when we had thirteen or fifteen or twenty features to look at . phd e : yeah , this is the professor c : um because something is a good feature uh by itself , you do n't really know how it 'll behave in combination and so it 's nice to have as many as many together at the same time as possible in uh in some reasonable visual form . there 's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny funny way . but it 's true that you should n't do any of that unless you know that the individual ones , at least , have have some uh some hope phd e : yeah . phd d : well , especially for normalizing . professor c : mm - hmm . phd d : i mean , it 's really important to pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature . professor c : mm - hmm . phd d : and it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same . e actually , i was wondering , right now you 're taking a all of the speech , from the whole meeting , and you 're trying to find points of overlap , but we do n't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker , professor c : right . phd d : right ? so i mean another way would just be to take the speech from just , say , morgan , and just jane and then just their overlaps , phd e : yeah . phd d : like but by hand , by cheating , and looking at you know , if you can detect something that way , because if we ca n't do it that way , there 's no good way that we 're going to be able to do it . grad a : no prayer . phd d : that you know , there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and then that combination alone . phd e : yeah . phd d : plus , i think it has more elegant e professor c : mm - hmm . phd d : the m the right model will be easier to see that way . so if i do n't know , if you go through and you find adam , cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e enough speech phd e : yeah . phd d : and just sort of look at those three cases of adam and the other person and the overlaps , phd e : yeah . phd d : maybe and just look at the distributions , maybe there is a clear pattern phd e : yeah . phd d : but we just ca n't see it because there 's too many combinations of of people that can overlap . phd e : uh - huh . yeah . postdoc b : i had the same intuition last last last week . phd d : so . just seems sort of complex . phd e : yeah . postdoc b : i think it 's to start with it 's s your your idea of simplifying , starting with something that you can see eh you know without the extra layers of phd d : right . cuz if energy does n't matter there , like i do n't think this is true , but what if phd e : to study individual ?"
