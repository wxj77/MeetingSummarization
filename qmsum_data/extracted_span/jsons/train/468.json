    "answer": "project manager : uh i think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh tim uh came with . the parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . marketing : industrial designer : project manager : uh industrial designer : project manager : there 's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh i think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . i do n't know how you think about it . marketing : yeah . user interface : well , i agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . project manager : yeah . user interface : um , yeah um system properties , um parental control . marketing : yeah but what i see uh how i see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a windows log-on screen with parents , children . user interface : yeah . mm . project manager : yeah . marketing : something like that . user interface : um , w well , yeah . marketing : and w when you want to use the parents uh option , you have to user interface : it it has to be fast . you do n't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . marketing : yeah , ok project manager : no but i think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children do n't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television , and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that . user interface : mm-hmm . why mm-hmm . you c may use like when there 's uh x_p_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . project manager : uh marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . pu push parents . user interface : and if you push parents , then marketing : that then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in . user interface : yeah . to log in . yeah . and if you puts a ye marketing : like two one three . project manager : yeah . user interface : uh-huh . marketing : and it 's in . user interface : and if you w you push p children , uh you do n't have to uh log in , but you can only watch uh children 's channels or uh marketing : it automatically goes yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : okay . well industrial designer : i do n't know if it 's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . because well it 's a simple function , but it 's gon na take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it . because you 'll have to start working with the profiles and such . and i 'm not sure if it 's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : well i think that 's a b there 's a big market for it , industrial designer : i do n't know what project manager : because uh you yeah , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that uh that he yeah , they believe that children uh are influenced by the television , industrial designer : marketing : mm yeah . v violent tv . project manager : and uh well , we 're we 're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years . but there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh user interface : yeah . well , maybe um some idea on that . project manager : yeah . user interface : just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , project manager : yeah . user interface : 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he would n't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do . marketing : yeah , of course . project manager : yeah . user interface : just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something . project manager : yeah yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : that 's a that 's a better idea ? marketing : yeah , w it just has to be w when it 's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . project manager : yeah . yeah , okay . marketing : but if you want to install it personally uh if i got kids , and i could choose between uh two remote controls . one uh w with parent control and one without , and i would would buy the one with . project manager : yeah , with and one without . yeah . user interface : um , b well , still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones . marketing : i th yeah . user interface : you 're thinking about some channels they uh can not see , but well , i i when i think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come industrial designer : marketing : user interface : and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels , marketing : yeah . user interface : because if you 're watching uh , i do n't know , you 're in the at day uh , cartoons will come up m on maybe friday night . i do n't know . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : yeah , maybe it can work with show view . uh , you you can control your video recorder with show view . user interface : project manager : uh , when you tick in a number , it will uh start and end uh recording . but maybe there 's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . user interface : yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all , project manager : yeah . that 's true . yeah . user interface : will have to decide uh marketing : yeah but yeah but that is n't possible . user interface : that is n't possible . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but , well , if you want to i i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let 's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the tv and presses up for instance . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : well uh , nob nobody 's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel . user interface : well , yeah you could say if parental control is only it it 'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but industrial designer : but that well , i 'm not sure because um for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control , so it would , yeah , have to be constant uh constant signalling . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : what m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . and that uh provides parental control , for instance . and that 's just an optional uh device . so there 's n that 's there 's uh besides uh the remote control , you 'll have a separate uh project manager : i would n't put it in an optional device . that that then then then it becomes too much , i think . industrial designer : yeah ? project manager : if we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise . marketing : yeah , and user interface : yeah , on a separate menu uh option . marketing : and and you know w uh when you install another device , uh children can still go up to the tv , p pop open uh the thing and and and g project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , that 's true . that 's true , marketing : go to a channel . industrial designer : but uh at same instant , same happens when uh you have remote control . so marketing : yeah , yeah of course . but industrial designer : but , only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , project manager : industrial designer : and those people would n't uh necessary want it . marketing : yeah . ah it 's industrial designer : so , you you 'd be marketing : yeah . yeah , okay . but it 's just an an added feature feature . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . and what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? i personally think that that becomes too much . user interface : yeah , well yeah , i project manager : it 's more like it gets you to the functionality , but user interface : a mail too from management that it 's very popular to use voice recon recognition . project manager : yeah . user interface : but i do n't think when you 're watching tv uh , hearing loud noises from the tv , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , uh yeah . marketing : mm yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , i think . but project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . project manager : and games ? marketing : games . it does n't industrial designer : yeah . i can see games happening . yeah . user interface : w you can put it on chip anyway , so uh marketing : yeah . project manager : that would user interface : as long as it 's is n't a primary feature of the remote , marketing : that that does n't c that does n't co user interface : but uh marketing : yeah , that that does n't cost a lot of extra resources , i think . project manager : okay . so that will uh that that that must be in it , you think ? industrial designer : yeah , that will be nice . project manager : okay . so the games uh are in it . the voice recognition are not . and the parental control are user interface : optional in project manager : optional ? marketing : yeah , it 's it 's in it . but too ma i i think so , but user interface : but how we do it ? project manager : yeah . user interface : well , i think also it 's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . so we should make it too complex . project manager : okay . user interface : is t some menu uh function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . marketing : yeah . user interface : but uh how how it 's gon na work uh uh will f be a problem . project manager : yeah , okay . uh , but uh will there uh uh like the first idea uh from uh you can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? or are we going to put it in and uh just uh user interface : mm-hmm . well ye i i think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option . marketing : to put user interface : you can put on marketing : yeah , to put it in always . project manager : yeah ? user interface : yeah . and you can just uh s when you buy it , you can select um personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something . project manager : mm yeah . industrial designer : well , i do n't know . i i figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . so you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . but it would would be uh more expensive . so , a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model . could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model , uh for instance . user interface : oh , it 's a p yeah . marketing : yeah , but tvs are n't capable of sending . industrial designer : yes they are . yeah . marketing : yeah ? i thought they were just project manager : yeah , you yo industrial designer : yeah , you you have some tvs any marketing : a able to receive . yeah , some . but project manager : yeah , but most often not . industrial designer : yeah . that is true , that is true . user interface : well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you can not watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you can not watch all channels after ten o'clock . marketing : yeah . user interface : and there 's just some little uh clock in the remote . industrial designer : well yeah , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control . marketing : yeah , j just some rules . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but you still have the problem about uh the television itself . user interface : no , no , it 's very simple . there uh th i h i 've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . industrial designer : yeah , yeah yeah . user interface : so , the remote does does n't transmit when it 's after twelve clock . marketing : yeah , okay . but , on the tv user interface : yeah ? marketing : at least my tv , is a is a compartment which you can press . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and there are buttons uh behind it which you can use , if you d if you do n't if you do n't have a industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . well , that 's to put it very blunt , that 's not our problem . just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh it 's not not a part of the remote . marketing : yeah . yeah . yeah , of course . industrial designer : yeah , that is true . yeah , that is true . user interface : you have to f yeah . industrial designer : yeah , you could you could you could go like user interface : uh , or make it ourselves very diffic industrial designer : uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , i figured i figure we could do that . yeah , yeah , sure . project manager : user interface : okay . industrial designer : uh , i 'm not sure what marketing thinks about it , but marketing : or j yeah . user interface : marketing : ah project manager : marketing : i have to uh consult my legal advisor about it . project manager : okay . so uh i think we have decided on the things that uh from janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : the case will be double-curved and uh rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : the buttons will be uh touch-screen . uh but there may not be too many buttons . and in the the menu structure , uh there must not to be uh five minutes to go . uh , too uh too many levels . and uh it must be easy to use . the parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . and the games are in it . so marketing : project manager : i think we have uh we have decided uh , okay . user interface : okay . marketing : consensus . project manager : uh , little more . marketing : oh . oh . i i have one thing left . project manager : yeah . marketing : maybe for uh jerome . user interface : yeah ? i 'm listening . marketing : um , the views . maybe it 's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view . project manager : like a like a moat or s or something . yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : um , well industrial designer : user profile . marketing : like at in the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons . project manager : yeah , but you have that in the user interface : what i was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you do n't use it is simple . project manager : yeah . you use the user interface : and when you push uh system properties , uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . it 's already incorporated a little in that concept . marketing : mm yeah , okay . fairly enough . yeah . industrial designer : well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users . marketing : yeah , wh which buttons you like or not . industrial designer : yeah , which buttons do you want to in it . because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . marketing : yeah . yeah . just leave the other numbers away . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah , you could you could m have people want uh want that . project manager : we take it to the other meeting , okay ? i have a little w uh little chat to do marketing : okay . go on . industrial designer : ah , yeah , sure . project manager : and uh then we uh finish ."
