    "answer": "john griffiths am : okay . diolch yn fawr , llyr . mark . mark reckless am : could i ask the reasons for professor donaldson being asked to undertake a review of estyn 's role ? meilyr rowlands : yes . i think any good organisation would welcome external scrutiny . i would say that , would n't i , because i 'm an inspector , but i think it 's important that we practise what we preach . there have been in the past systems of quinquennial reviews . i think it is healthy for anybody to have that sort of external view , and i think in particular we 're proud in estyn that we are a body that is developing and trying new things and evolving continuously . so , i think it 's that . but if you were to ask , 'why now ? ' , it 's because of the extent of the education reform that we 're particularly facing . so , i think it 's a good thing to do at any given time , but considering the range and speed of change that we 're facing in education now , i thought it was particularly important that we ask graham donaldson to look at the implications for our work of all this education reform . mark reckless am : what have been the biggest benefits to wales of having estyn as an independent body inspecting schools and other institutions in wales compared to the work that ofsted has done in england ? meilyr rowlands : well , we have very good relationships with ofsted and with education scotland and the education training inspectorate in northern ireland . i would n't like to compare\u2014i do n't think it would be fair to compare ourselves . we do things slightly differently , but we benefit a lot from each other . we have inspectors from ofsted or from scotland , from northern ireland , on our inspections . we shadow them , and our inspectors go to their countries . so , we 're working quite closely with the home countries , but also further afield with holland and with the republic of ireland , for example . so , we 're always , all of us , learning from one another about what we think they do well and what they think we do well . we 're constantly learning from each other . i would n't think it 's fair for me to say what i think\u2014you know , where we 're better than another country . mark reckless am : of course . i 'm not asking you to criticise ofsted . i agree that would n't be appropriate . but i think what is fair for me to ask is : perhaps could you highlight one or two areas where you believe that estyn has a particular difference of emphasis and approach from ofsted ? meilyr rowlands : i think one of the things we 've done and we 've developed over many years is the use of the nominee and peer inspectors in particular . so , we 've got , i think , a really good tradition of doing that in wales , and when we do meet other inspectorates , they 're always very interested in that part of our work . we 're a very small organisation ; we 're only about 50 hmis . we inspect a wide range of sectors , as you know , but the bulk of that inspection work is actually done now by peer inspectors . so , i think that , and the idea of a nominee , is also of interest to other inspectorates across the world . so , there 's always someone from the body that we are inspecting on the inspection team . they 're part of all the discussions so they actually understand how we 've come to our report , and they can then help the organisation move forward after we 've left . mark reckless am : i 've clashed with welsh ministers on the absence of league tables for schools in wales , with less accountability for their results than is the case in england . i note it as a parent myself . but , from , i think , at some point in 2014 , you started in your inspection reports of primary schools putting the comparison of how they were doing compared to other schools and local authorities and nationally , as well as what you 've described as their family of schools , and being more transparent over their key stage 2 results . so , what led you to do that ? what difference has that made ? and was that decision taken by estyn on its own account , or was that something that was agreed with welsh ministers ? meilyr rowlands : i did listen to plenary , so i 've heard you raise this issue . i 'm sure it 's inadvertent on your part , but you 've confused absolutely everyone with this . mark reckless am : i 'm pleased to let you set the record straight , then . meilyr rowlands : it 's not actually true . the data that you refer to is published by the welsh government on my local school . so , if you want to know about your own school or any other school , you should go onto that website . that 's hugely\u2014 . it 's very clear . there 's a huge amount of data on it , but it 's very , very clear . you can look at it in terms of tables and data and graphs and it shows all that data that you refer to , and that 's the right place to have it . we do refer to some of that data in our reports , because our reports are based on evidence . most of it is first-hand evidence that we see in the classroom and see in pupils ' work , but we triangulate that with data and with what parents and pupils say and interviews with staff . so , we refer to that data and we always have referred to the data . pre 2014 , it was in the body of the text , and then after 2014 we put it in an appendix . we had a mid-cycle review and people felt it would be better in an appendix than in the body of the text , but it was always there . there 's pros and cons on whether it should be in the body of the text or in an appendix . mark reckless am : well , certainly , the data became clear to me in reports after 2014 in a way it was n't before . so , i will leave that there . can i just highlight a few of what i felt were either particularly striking statistics or comparisons or points that were made in your annual report of potential concern ? you state that headteachers do not understand the principles of good pedagogy or good practice in about three quarters of schools\u2014this relates to the foundation phase . i find that quite a shocking statistic . do you share that view ? meilyr rowlands : yes . that 's why i highlighted it in my foreword . i think there is a general consensus about the benefits of the foundation phase . there 's a lot of research , and our own evidence shows that , where it is implemented well , pupils benefit a lot from it and they 're well prepared to be independent thinkers . so , it 's a development that we should be proud of in wales , i think , the foundation phase . it 's a great thing . but , we are disappointed that only about a quarter of primary schools are implementing it fully . there 's a whole range of reasons , as i discuss in the annual report , why that might be the case . it is quite an innovative idea , and i think it 's misunderstood by saying it 's learning through play , because that 's a bit too simplistic a definition of it . we have written a report recently on good practice in the foundation phase , so that we can try and explain clearly to people what the benefits of it are and how best to implement it . but i think it is true that too many headteachers\u2014 . many of them might not have taught in foundation phase , they might not have that infant background , they might have a junior-school background . there might not have been enough\u2014well , we say there was n't enough training\u2014or there might be people who missed any training that there was then . so , overall , there is a large number of leaders who do n't fully appreciate what the foundation phase could deliver . john griffiths am : darren\u2014is it on this ? darren millar am : yes , it is on this . i was just wondering\u2014 . i mean , one of the problems that i know you 've identified in the past is this lack of good practice being able to travel into all parts of wales , and , of course , we 've got local authorities , we 've got regional consortia , we 've got the welsh government\u2014all of which want to see good practice replicated where possible . what opportunities are there , perhaps , to develop some other further opportunities for good practice to be shared and promoted ? i know that the wales audit office , for example , has its good practice exchange . is there something similar that schools can engage with to make things happen ? meilyr rowlands : it 's a good question . i mean , specifically to do with foundation phase , there is a foundation phase\u2014i ca n't remember what it 's called now\u2014excellence network i think , which is being relaunched . i think it was supposed to be relaunched during the snow period . so , there are networks being established . there 's one for mathematics\u2014a national network for excellence in mathematics\u2014there 's one for science and there 's one for foundation phase in particular . so , i think it is a challenge that we have n't cracked yet in wales : how do we make sure that good practice does travel ? i think one specifically for foundation phase is a good idea , because we 've got a specific issue with the foundation phase . mark reckless am : when you say that\u2014 john griffiths am : mark , just before you go on , i think julie wanted to come in on this point as well . julie morgan am : yes . i just wondered if you could give us some examples about how the foundation phase is not being implemented in the true spirit of the foundation phase in the three quarters of schools that you think fall\u2014 . meilyr rowlands : well , what we mean by that is schools not necessarily teaching badly , but in a more traditional way . and where we 've seen that most obviously is in year 1 and year 2 . some schools actually reverted , after the introduction of the new tests , from what was pedagogy that was in line with the foundation phase . and basically , if i understand it correctly , it 's more to do with the children making their own choices about what they do . and that is pretty common in nursery and reception classes , but it 's less common in year 1 and year 2 . claire morgan : i think it is very much , as meilyr said , the difference between a pupil-led learning experience or a teacher-led learning experience . because of the lack of training and maybe the confidence to pursue that active and experiential learning approach , teachers have tended to resort to what they feel more comfortable with , which is more of an adult-led learning\u2014often still high quality , but it does n't ensure that the learners become far more independent , far more engaged in their learning . so , it 's almost holding children back to an extent . they 're making good progress , but they could be making even more progress . john griffiths am : okay . mark . mark reckless am : so , when you say that some teachers are sort of holding children back , and in the report that three quarters of schools do n't understand the principles of good pedagogy or good practice , what you mean is that teachers are using traditional methods , including whole-class teaching , rather than moving towards a pupil-led learning experience and one that you said was oversimplified as learning through play . may not the issue here therefore be that estyn is seeking to impose this different approach on teachers who think that they are better able to teach children in the traditional way , which , at least in my experience , would be supported by quite a number of parents ? meilyr rowlands : i do n't think it 's estyn that's imposing it . that 's the national policy . mark reckless am : do you support that policy ? meilyr rowlands : well , we do , actually . we do . our evidence , as i said , is that , when it is implemented properly , pupils do actually gain from it . but we 're not imposing it , and what we 're saying is that headteachers are not necessarily understanding it . i think there is quite a lot of jargon around it . i was just looking in the annual report . quite unusually , in this section , we have had to actually explain some of the technical terms , like 'continuous provision ' . so that 's , i think , one of the reasons why people do n't understand it fully . that 's why we did produce this quite substantial bit of work , trying to unpack what this actually means in practice and giving a lot of good examples of the practice . mark reckless am : you referred to evidence of this approach working . given the timing of when it was brought in and where we are now , has that really had time to distil through the system and give compelling evidence that this approach works better than more traditional approaches ? meilyr rowlands : i think it has , to be fair . i think this has , because we 're talking about a lot of developmental work related to the foundation phase prior to 2010 , but it became compulsory for all schools to deliver it from 2010 onwards . so , that gives enough time for children to have been through the whole of the foundation phase onto key stage 2 , and we can see the effect of it . in the schools where there is good practice in the foundation phase , we can see the effect when we inspect on key stage 2 children . mark reckless am : so , would you be confident about this , in the next few years , feeding through into an improvement in programme for international student assessments , rather than a further deterioration ? meilyr rowlands : yes . i think that if we did what darren was talking about , getting more schools to share good practice , i think it will expand and more schools will take it on , yes . mark reckless am : okay . on the sharing of good practice , you put emphasis in the report on this being an improving area and trend for the future as well , but i think you did raise concerns that it was n't monitored or evaluated sufficiently well , particularly where one school was supporting another . how should that be done better ? meilyr rowlands : well , i think this has been a theme of many of the issues we 've raised : that , whatever the initiative , you ca n't tell whether it 's been successful or not unless you evaluate it properly . so , those evaluation skills , i think , are very important . i think that , with the development of the national academy for educational leadership , i would hope that research skills and evaluative skills would be part of the kind of training that headteachers get that maybe in the past they did n't . so , that becomes more of the day-to-day work of schools\u2014that naturally , whenever you do something , you evaluate it afterwards . we 've evaluated a lot of the school-to-school work . we 've published two or three reports on it , and we 've identified what we think is good practice and not-so-good practice . john griffiths am : okay , mark ? if we move on at this stage\u2014i wonder , before other members come in , if i could ask about community-focused schools . quite a lot of what we discussed earlier was around the importance of getting families and the community more involved in education , and one way of doing that , i think , is through community-focused schools that are very much accessible to the community , linked well with outside organisations , having an extended school-day offer . we have the twenty-first century schools programme , but we have a lot of schools existing that have n't been part of that . i just wondered to what extent estyn might encourage or highlight the need to encourage greater consistency in community-focused schools across wales , because i think there is a feeling that it is very inconsistent . meilyr rowlands : yes , we would very much be happy to support anything like that . we discussed it earlier . we were talking about targeting vulnerable learners earlier this morning . we see that as , particularly , a solution for that long-standing issue we have in wales in particular . so , yes , we do have good examples of good practice . we mentioned some of them earlier this morning . i 've puzzled about this . i think there was a bit of a misunderstanding about the term 'community-focused school ' . i think it became thought of as meaning the community just uses the facilities in the evening and , of course , it 's a much , much broader concept than that . i think some schools particularly did n't like the community using their facilities in the evening , and that became , i think , possibly part of the reason why community-focused schools did n't become more popular . the way i look at it is , as claire was explaining earlier about the school offering all kinds of services to people\u2014you know , family learning , those sorts of nurture groups , all those sorts of educationally focused services available from the school , and generally building relationships . they 're more to do with the culture than the actual building and the facilities . but , yes , we certainly have seen and identified where that good practice exists . john griffiths am : so , if there might be a mechanism that could have community-focused schools working in the way that you 've described right across wales , would estyn be in favour of such a mechanism ?"
