    "answer": "suzy davies am : oh , thank you . my question goes back to the comment you made earlier , minister , about the number of children doubling\u2014sorry , vulnerable children doubling\u2014after the easter break , if we can call it that . so , what i 'm after is a sense of churn in these establishments . so , was that figure a recovery of a number of children that had been there before the easter break , and are the people who are there still the same people as were there right at the beginning of the crisis and the lockdown ? kirsty williams am : suzy , what i believe that we 're seeing in our schools is new pupils coming into school . so , there has been , i know , a real effort on behalf of educationalists and social services staff to really reach out to families and to make sure that they 're aware of the support that is available out there for them and their children , and to be able to give them the confidence that there are\u2014that the hubs are available for them . so , we have seen an increase in children . those numbers are still small and , i believe , potentially , there is an opportunity to build on that and to have further conversations with families about the support that is available for vulnerable children , whether that\u2014 . that vulnerability , of course , can cover a whole range of issues . as i said when we last met , this is a constantly evolving situation . the initial response\u2014local authorities and schools worked incredibly fast and incredibly quickly to set up these hubs . we 've seen an evolution in the weeks since that time and i am sure that we will continue to see some evolution in approaches . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . hefin , you had a supplementary\u2014briefly , please . hefin david am : yes , very quickly . i 've been listening to the answers with regard to vulnerable children , following on from that answer . i 'm at home with a vulnerable child\u2014a child who has got additional learning needs . she 's got autism ; she 's four . i imagine there are many , many parents in exactly the same position\u2014i 've heard from them . i have n't heard anything from the school or from the local authority . should i have heard something or should i be proactive in pursuing it ? kirsty williams am : i do n't want to comment on personal cases\u2014 hefin david am : but there are many others in this position ."
