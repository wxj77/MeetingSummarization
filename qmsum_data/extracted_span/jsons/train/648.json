    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about user requirements of the new remote control ?",
    "answer": "marketing : mm . 'kay . project manager : file open . marketing : we go . project manager : trend watching . marketing : okay . so uh to gather my research , two basic methods . we compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . and then we we research uh fashion trends in europe , what 's what 's the new black , project manager : okay . marketing : you know , as it goes . next slide please . uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . as in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that 's a bonus , but they do n't care so much , you know . they want it to be that 's sounds a bit like a contradiction . technology technical technologically innovative . people want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . so like the interface is really important . and easy to use , it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important i mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . people want it i is it has to be cooler than easy to use , you know , if it has the newest features , even if it 's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features . and if it 's easy to use that 's a bonus . the fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . how that relates to a remote control i do n't know . project manager : marketing : but i i see i come on to that in the next in the next slide . spongy . i 've als i 've been saying everything 's the new black . well spongy 's the new black as well . so we have the choice between rubber and plastic . if it 's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it 's spongy , then can i skip the rest ? industrial designer : oh yeah , i forgot to mention that . the uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . marketing : okay . okay , so industrial designer : forgot to say that . marketing : kinda spongy material . project manager : okay . marketing : so um so my personal opinion ? um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . but what we what we need is something that looks like it 's from the future that looks cool , that 's that 's different , you know , that 's everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , you need something cool . like , titanium is cool but it 's expensive . and maybe it 's a bit of overkill for a remote control . um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it . um i mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important for it 's the up to the interface guy . so if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we 're gon na go along with it then it does n't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . it could be something like , i say potato peeler but i 'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than i do . so i think cool is the key . few questions about a spongy remote control . i 've never seen one before . i 've seen plastic remote controls . i think maybe they were i do n't know , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : sturdy , you know . for being strong and sturdy . so um if we want something strong and sturdy , i say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it does n't matter , it 's spongy material , it 's not gon na break , you know . i just do n't know how the l_e_d_ and the lights are gon na fit into a spongy material because it 's not gon na be completely squeezable . so how do things fit it ? and if we are gon na use spongy , we can say it 's long lasting , you know it 's damage resistant and stuff like that , so . so just to summarise , people want stuff that 's cool , that 's that looks like it 's cool , and if it is cool then that 's a bonus does n't have to be um people like fruit and veg . we can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it . people like spongy material . if we 're gon na use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . and also , this was this year . so , things change all the time , every year you know they they always talk about this year , this is the new black . well next year something else is gon na be the new black project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and we 're stuck with last year 's fruit and veg type stuff . project manager : okay . marketing : 'kay . that 's me . project manager : well , um i would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year 's lead on most people anyway . you always have to bring out new designs , so if we can get next year then that 's possibly a good place to start anyway . um ."
