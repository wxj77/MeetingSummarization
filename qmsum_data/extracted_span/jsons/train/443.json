    "answer": "marketing : project manager : okay . marketing : . project manager : right . okay . alright . is everyone here ? marketing : yep . project manager : okay . this is our conceptual design meeting . and i 'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . and then we 'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . um i 'll go through the mee through the minutes first . um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . industrial designer : project manager : um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . um and our marketing expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . people thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . industrial designer : project manager : um and that they often lose the it 's easy to lose a remote . um which were all things we were thinking we would wan na make it simple . um and uh some sort of locator . either a button or tracking device . um and that it should look different than what 's out there . um kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . the younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . um uh i think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers ' nerves . um then the user interface designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . um the simple versus the um the complex . the simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . um um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . um and that we did n't wan na go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . um we would just have a tv remote . um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . have it s be something that looks different . and finally our um industrial designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . um from energy source , um uh what we would use . batteries because we do n't wan na have a a cable . um how that would power the remote and the lamp . if we were to to have one . uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the tv . um i believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . um um something that will fit into uh easily into someone 's hand . and with a , just a few buttons . just the basics . and with a scrolling um function also . okay and i will leave that , leave it at that . so marketing ? marketing : okay . project manager : we 're watching trends . marketing : yep . can i have your cable please ? project manager : i suppose that you can have this . industrial designer : marketing : thanks . okay so i was looking at trend-watching . um unfortunately i was n't given too much information . i was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . and then i 'll just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that . um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which i think we 've kind of already discussed before . um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . and again these are all things we 've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . and thirdly the remote would be easy to use . as far as fashion update , we 've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . industrial designer : marketing : so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . okay so from that um , as we 've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . um i think we 've already discovered that it 's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . but i think that , even if it 's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they 're getting something that 's new and modern and sleek and whether it 's through the shape or the colours or all of that . um for technologically innovative , we 've talked about the tracking device . we brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . and manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . we need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which i think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . i do n't know , i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . project manager : a banana shape ? user interface : oh it was sort of banana shaped . marketing : yeah . yeah . right . or with exterior designs . but my question is , i mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and i 'm not sure how they 'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . project manager : marketing : so maybe we could have something that 's somewhat removable , or i do n't know , different options for female , male target groups . and then the spongy feel . i guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that 's out there . c and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . so that 's that . project manager : so possibly like a uh , industrial designer : alright . marketing : project manager : sorry , just to butt in for a second . possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? marketing : that 's what i was thinking yeah . user interface : those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones . project manager : you have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that 's a spongy user interface : marketing : yeah . so when you buy your remote you can buy project manager : feel to it . you can marketing : various coverings . project manager : mm various covers . user interface : what 's it called ? cust you personalised , yeah . marketing : personalise your remote . project manager : we could leave that to the cover department . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : project manager : we all know they 've got nothing to do all day . industrial designer : marketing : industrial designer : user interface : okay . why ca n't i see the crazy . um yeah i talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . um so i 've looked at some of the stuff i was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . um i was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . they gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . um okay . there 's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . um there 's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . a command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . um and then it ju that 's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . you ca n't really see that picture well , but there 's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . industrial designer : user interface : so , then i had a look at new products that are on the market . not necessarily remote controls but ones that you 'll recognise . um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . i have a there is a picture . you surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , tv , cable , satellite , v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ and audio . and you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . so the technology is there . um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . you can sort of just make those out . and then on the right is obviously an ipod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . that is a possibility . and nothing 's simpler really . um then there 's things like this , which is a a a kid 's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . so the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . and um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . so i do n't know if there 's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a v_ for volume . just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . um i think , d carrying on from what i 've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . maybe we 've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . and then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . um i do n't it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an ipod where you just sort of control through the menus . stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . and then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . and that is it . why am i oh yeah . just . where are we ? uh . just to sort of show you . m they 've even got things like that . project manager : user interface : huge things . which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ? project manager : marketing : industrial designer : that 's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that . user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : notice the giant dog bone shape ? marketing : dunno . industrial designer : makes sense , makes sense . user interface : and that yeah . industrial designer : project manager : also good for animals . user interface : yeah . see . things . . why 's my screen crazy ? industrial designer : uh well let 's see . i 'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . project manager : marketing : industrial designer : just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . i 've more information on possible materials um as well . what we can and can not do . um but let 's just wait for this to load up and i 'll show you what we 're talking about here . okay . the details of the components ' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . the underside , that 's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it 's getting and will do what you tell it . um so much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . when you press a key um you complete a specific connection . the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . right . pretty clear . transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light . the sensor in the tv can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . this is the circuit board from the other side . um the lower part of it , i do n't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . um you can see the circuit board itself . that 's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . um what you do is you have , do n't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . these are the actual keys that are being pressed . they close the electric circuit . that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . that would be behind here . um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that marketing : industrial designer : amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . um the way it works is that you have the keys here . the rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . and thus gives on the signal . now this is the simple version . um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . we are talking something more complicated of course , it 's going to be more expensive as well . and not only that . um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . um i 've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . so it 's pretty squishy . that would that would serve that purpose . marketing : spongy ? industrial designer : um we could also use wood , or titanium . project manager : what 's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? user interface : marketing : user interface : industrial designer : oh fya marketing : industrial designer : i do n't have an information on that . however our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so i assume , i 'm , i was given an okay to use it . project manager : industrial designer : it certainly is an expensive material , project manager : industrial designer : i 'm aware of that , but i was given an okay . marketing : industrial designer : but there are certain restrictions to certain materials . now let 's first go through the list with the materials . so we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . can also mix these . um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . um what we could use is , or what i was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . right ? uh a dynamo . interestingly enough . marketing : industrial designer : um we could use solar cells . or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . such as like watches you know . where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . so um obviously i personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . project manager : marketing : industrial designer : you do n't wan na wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? um solar cell is interesting . may fail though , every here and there . user interface : would you have to leave it by the window ? industrial designer : mm . yeah user interface : yeah . industrial designer : . or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and yeah mm . project manager : works well in arizona but in edinburgh not so industrial designer : always the you but marketing : y probably not yeah . industrial designer : exactly . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . marketing : industrial designer : so i 'd say what we 're stuck with really is um the basic battery . which also makes a base station basically obsolete . we do n't need that then . um however our interface options are push-buttons . in which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . um however we 've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . and they are possible . we have an okay for scroll wheels . okay . um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i 've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an lcd into the remote control as well . this however may exclude certain um materials . if you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an lcd screen may be affected by the movement . hence we might not be able to put it in there . so um there 's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . if we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that i 've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . i do n't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . i 'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let 's have a more sophisticated chip , but that 's not up to me to decide really . so that 's for the for the scroll wheel . um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so i 'd say rather not go for for that . let 's see now . um um solar cells can not be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . but obviously that 's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , i assume right ? or is anybody still user interface : yeah . project manager : no i think i think batteries are probably the way to go . industrial designer : alright . marketing : no . hmm . industrial designer : alright . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional i assume . um um with the titanium um we can not make it a curved design . we would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much . which i assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . user interface : would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . marketing : mm . like a covering . yeah . user interface : so i do n't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic . but then where do people hold it ? project manager : yeah . user interface : just all be sort of spongy . marketing : the we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . user interface : so you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? like the ipod ? industrial designer : you can have an lcd screen . um but therefore no rubber will be used . user interface : right . industrial designer : alright ? so plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . with plastic , as i understand it , you can use any form . um latex is tricky . or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . so the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an lcd screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . or wood even . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um if you wan na make it a particular shape , use plastic . add an lcd screen , add a scroll wheel , that 'll be fine . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : or make it just push-buttons . basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . maybe not the nicest feel . or not much originality really . project manager : so the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? or the rubbery we can not ? industrial designer : with rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : but we can not add scroll wheels , and we can not add an lcd screen . project manager : mm . industrial designer : that 's the tricky thing . user interface : could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . so that 's thing if we did it yellow . project manager : yeah . user interface : and um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . they would n't have any they 're just on the exterior . they would n't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . project manager : is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? industrial designer : s certainly can be done yes . um yeah . if that does n't affect the functional side of it all . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : like say just the underside or so then it can be done . i assume . yeah . so the fruit design um how about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? say we do n't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but uh give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . you name it . project manager : what about a smell ? industrial designer : just design-wise . user interface : marketing : project manager : t to the remote ? industrial designer : mm . nice one . user interface : you could just sell it in different colours as well i suppose . in different ye yellows . marketing : bright citrus colours yeah . user interface : i do n't suppose we have to stick to co industrial designer : well we we 're supposed to stick to the company colours though , user interface : stick to the colours yeah . marketing : oh yeah . industrial designer : that 's yellow and grey . marketing : yellow and grey . project manager : yellow and grey . industrial designer : so what have we , lemon , banana , is user interface : mm grapefruit . project manager : grapefruit . industrial designer : grapefruit marketing : industrial designer : is what we 'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . but mm . project manager : i would say , if i were to make a decision , i would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . user interface : yeah . marketing : user interface : . project manager : um marketing : i think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , project manager : marketing : like user interface : yeah . industrial designer : well we have it banana-shaped already , kind of . marketing : well we kinda do yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so project manager : well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer . user interface : yeah . and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour . marketing : and if it 's yellow ? industrial designer : right . project manager : it 's it 's yellow . it 's curved . industrial designer : i it 's yellow . marketing : grey buttons yeah . project manager : it 's sort of industrial designer : well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? project manager : couple of couple of grey stripes . marketing : user interface : yeah . project manager : we could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . user interface : on the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey . project manager : it would look like a banana just sitting on their table . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : there you go . project manager : rather than rather th industrial designer : marketing : user interface : it could and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was . project manager : maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . marketing : nice . could look like a fruit bowl . industrial designer : it could be an ape . project manager : could be , marketing : user interface : yeah . project manager : it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . we could have a variety of options here . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : marketing : 'kay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : do you have more to your presentation ? industrial designer : that 's pretty much it . i informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go . project manager : okay . i 'm gon na plug in here real quick . if i could . industrial designer : sure . hang on . there you go . project manager : like i said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . um ow . ow . marketing : so is the two piece idea out ? or have we not decided ? user interface : well we sort of rid of that because gon na use a battery . and the base station might not be necessary . marketing : oh right okay . industrial designer : well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , user interface : yeah . marketing : industrial designer : but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we can still do that . however of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so um which then , as i understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an lcd screen and so on so on . you 'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there . marketing : mm . industrial designer : but could be done , of course . project manager : okay . uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case . probably case um material . and probably a shape also . um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . and what kind of supplements we 'll have . um energy source i think we 've , i think we 've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . industrial designer : right . project manager : and we have five minutes . industrial designer : okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as i said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gon na be a cheap one . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : right ? project manager : so um i guess we should pick the case then . if we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . we could have a complex one or a a non-complex . but did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : well what about what you said , like putting the user interface : just project manager : . user interface : just maybe marketing : finger grips just on top of the plastic ? user interface : yeah . just a little bit of . project manager : okay . so we would , we would have the lcd screen ? industrial designer : as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . project manager : 'kay . so i guess the case would be plastic , with perhaps that 's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . it 's more of a su it 's more of a supplement maybe . industrial designer : . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : m more of a l lamination perhaps . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so then for the scroll , are we going for the ipod type ? user interface : yeah i think so . i think marketing : yeah ? okay . project manager : which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? industrial designer : yes . it does . project manager : 'kay . so i guess that , is that , is that about it ? so we have a good idea of what we 're gon na need to to do on this ? industrial designer : right . project manager : um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . um here 's what 's gon na be going on . um um ryan you 'll be working on the user interface design . um manuel you 'll be working on the look-and-feel design . industrial designer : right . project manager : corrine we 'll want a product evaluation . and the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh user interface : marketing : project manager : maybe and and get us a prototype . which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . user interface : project manager : so that basically just be working on the prototype , uh we 'll accomplish your other two actions . industrial designer : project manager : alright . okay . let 's do it ."
