    "answer": "kirsty williams am : thank you , llyr . i think it 's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions , those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals . but in some cases , schools may use their pdg funding to provide a universal intervention , but we would want to\u2014in challenge advisers ' discussions in schools\u2014we 'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals . so , for instance , if i give you an example in your own region , llyr : at brynteg county primary school in wrexham , if you look at that primary school in wrexham , their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts . so , there is no differentiation in those results . one of the things that they 've used their pdg for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school . so , that 's a universal thing that they 've trained all the teachers in , but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals . so , if you 're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset , it 's about really challenging learners to think that , ' i can do things . if sometimes i fail , i pick myself up , i 'm more resilient . ' now , that has been , as i said , trained to all the teachers in the school\u2014it 's an ethos for the whole school\u2014but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater , and now they 're at the same level . so , that 's the important distinction . individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals , but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff , for instance , and that , then , has to demonstrate it has a disproportionate effect on free school meals . so , growth mindset ; it may be attachment disorder training for staff , for instance , where we know it 's of benefit to everybody , but will have particular benefits for that cohort of students . with regard to more able and talented , you know , llyr , that this is an area of concern for me , generally , within the welsh education system ; that we 've not been particularly good at identifying , supporting and driving attainment for those children . i 'm absolutely clear that pdg needs to be used for those children who are eligible to drive potential , whatever the potential of that child is , including more able and talented . and again , i 'll give you an example that has been seen as good practice in pembrokeshire : a window on the world bus , again paid for by schools . i do n't know if you 're aware of it . llyr gruffydd am : we 've heard about that ."
