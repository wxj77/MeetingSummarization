    "answer": "industrial designer : 's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so in that sense project manager : okay . marketing : yeah , sure . industrial designer : so it does kind of make sense , yeah . project manager : okay , well marketing : it kinda does make sense , does n't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we 're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background . project manager : okay . marketing : everything i have is kinda background . project manager : okay we all ready to go ? well how um on the in this meeting then if we um i 'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . and we uh decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and we decided that it was gon na be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we 're gon na group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um . and i told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the tv , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . um so that was the last meeting . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : is there anything have i forgotten anything ? is that everything ? marketing : uh that sounds . project manager : okay . um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you 're gon na want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we 'll have all the discussion at the end . that might be a better idea this time . marketing : sure . project manager : and so if we start off uh with andrew and then craig and then david , marketing : okay . project manager : if that 's alright . marketing : sure . project manager : um and then after that we 'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right . marketing : yeah , cool . project manager : so if you wan na take this . marketing : why do n't i get that ? hmm . project manager : screwed in quite tightly . uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? we did we say we were gon na try maybe incorporate it but we had n't made a definite decision on that ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : right . oh i should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . marketing : okay . project manager : so um that 's kind of the end result hopefully . marketing : okay . um alright so c is it function f_ eight ? project manager : uh-huh . hopefully appear in a wee second . marketing : hmm . come on . i think it 's working . project manager : up there we go . marketing : okay great s so let me just start this . okay great . so um uh s move on . uh-huh oh where 'd it all go ? project manager : oh no . marketing : it 's not good . okay lem me just see where i can find it . this looks more like it . i think i just opened up the template . project manager : oh right . marketing : sorry about that . okay alright so let 's have a look here . project manager : here we go . marketing : okay so this was the method that um i 've taken . uh basically what i wan na do here , before we get into it uh too far , is i want to show you all the background information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . project manager : okay . marketing : and uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that i 've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . um so i 've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : i thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that 's why i suggested we get in this . project manager : aye a fair point definitely . marketing : okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy . project manager : okay . marketing : um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , i think , creative about it . number two was that it be innovative . okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um quite user friendly while still having technology . so it i 'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that i think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . project manager : aye right . marketing : for example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what i mean , like , or it 's got something else to it that just seems innovative project manager : uh-huh . marketing : because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use . so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? well that 's i guess where we 're gon na go with this . project manager : okay . marketing : okay then there 's the other aspect of the back the the market um research i have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we 've agreed is a priority . uh top european fashion trend um that i read about says there 's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , industrial designer : project manager : marketing : especially in clothes and furniture . and when i first saw that i thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , project manager : okay okay . marketing : do you know what i mean ? so my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . um 'cause i think what we 're in what we 're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um so i think we might wan na be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , project manager : marketing : i think that would be pushing it . industrial designer : marketing : and then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . so um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year 's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , i think that 'll be in our favour . um so these this is the summary of everything . um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we 're selling to . uh innovative design technology 's also a must in that it 's seen it 'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . that was like the number three thing . and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that 's the way i interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so i 've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , mac ipods , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : something which is , i 'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there 's like no buttons . project manager : mm that 's true , yeah . marketing : you know what a mac ipod is ? i 'm thinking however mac ipod is sort of last year 's because it 's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so i 'm thinking if we imagine that we 're taking some of the features of a mac ipod and we 're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . um and then so this is w with all that information what i 'm what i 'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . sort of like a i dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . um does that make sense ? yeah . so so like i threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , i dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it 's just an idea , 'cause i 'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . project manager : mm 'kay . great . marketing : like um the ones the ones which i 'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . like i see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and project manager : okay . marketing : so anyway it 's just just an idea . project manager : yeah . marketing : i 'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up . how can we build on that ? maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so . project manager : okay . marketing : anyway those are that 's all i have , project manager : that 's great . marketing : but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into"
