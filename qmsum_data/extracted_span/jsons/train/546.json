    "query": "<s> what did industrial designer say about the working design of the remote during the discussion of the component design ?",
    "answer": "project manager : go away . industrial designer : thank you . uh when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , marketing : industrial designer : and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed . marketing : industrial designer : it pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light . like you have got a signal by pressing a button . that 's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l_e_d_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . the sensor on the tv can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do . then it will do the appropriate action . so uh this is how the remote controller works ."
