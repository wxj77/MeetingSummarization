    "query": "<s> what did the group talk about the possible official solution to the problem with more funding , a new immigration policy and the help of the minister ?",
    "answer": "julie morgan am : the additional \u00a36.4 million that went to hefcw in the 2017-18 year , which i think you say is partly because of brexit and partly because of demographic and recruitment challenges , what do you expect to see as a result of that spending ? kirsty williams am : that funding was allocated , as i said , to enable hefcw to deal with any short-term implications arising out of demographic changes , because we 've seen a drop in the number of 18-year-olds , and the initial implications of eu transition . it was allocated as part of hefcw 's overall grant in aid , and therefore the council was given discretion as to how it was to be apportioned to the sector . the money was brought forward a year , because , in conversations with hefcw and the institutions , they felt that that money would be more useful earlier on . so , it was money that was brought forward into the allocation for 2017-18 , as opposed to 2018-19 , because they wanted to have that resource earlier rather than later . with regard to additional resources , you 'll be aware that we have made an additional resource of \u00a35 million available to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees , and \u00a35 million has been made available to hefcw to kick-start the work on postgraduate support until we 're in a position to fully implement diamond at the postgraduate level . julie morgan am : you say that the money is used at the discretion of the universities . so , you do n't have an analysis of how that was spent . kirsty williams am : the financial allocation , as i said , was agreed with the funding council and it was there to help universities with any cash flow issues , but if you 'd like further details i can provide those as much as i 'm able . julie morgan am : i think it would be interesting if we know what the money was spent on and , of course , that money is now not available for the next financial year , so there 's no way of carrying on what they were doing with it , presumably . kirsty williams am : well , as i said , it was part of the overall allocation to hefcw . with specific regard to dealing with the impact of brexit , you 'll be aware that we have reached an agreement in principle on the funding of \u00a33.5 million to the global wales initiative . this was an application that came in from universities wales looking at specifically targeting and beefing up international work and international recruitment work to support them at this time , and we 're currently working with universities wales on the exact details and outcomes they would expect from that investment . julie morgan am : and do you have any estimate of how many students you hope to attract by that ? kirsty williams am : that is subject to continuing negotiations with universities wales before we let any contracts with them . what 's important is that that work is based on research that has been done by universities wales to look at the optimum markets that we should be targeting , specifically the united states of america and vietnam . julie morgan am : and will this money be used equally between all the universities ? kirsty williams am : we expect that all institutions\u2014should they have a desire to participate\u2014will be able to be assisted , as well as the overall global branding from universities wales and the new study in wales initiative . julie morgan am : thank you . i think we 've covered the eu student fees , have n't we ? lynne neagle am : okay . do you want to ask question 12 ? julie morgan am : has the welsh government explored the possibility of looking at different immigration rules for international and eu students who may wish to study here ? kirsty williams am : okay . well , with regard to immigration , clearly , this is something , at the moment , that is out of our hands , and i have to say , it has n't got off to a great start when initially the post-study work visas were issued just for a number of institutions in the south-east of england , with no consultation with us and i do n't believe with the scottish government either . so , we have campaigned , pushed , cajoled , lobbied , and i was very glad that in december last year , the home office did then make that scheme available to cardiff and to trinity saint david . we continue to press the point that we do not believe that , first of all , international students should be included in any immigration targets . i think all the evidence suggests that the british public do n't regard international students as immigrants , and therefore we do need to make sure that they are taken out of the targets and we can continue to press that message with the uk government . at the moment , you 'll be aware that welsh government has looked at a specific piece of work on whether there was any scope for specific immigration policy for wales , although i must say that was mostly in the field of actually the workforce rather than students . you 'll be aware that this week the government 's migration advisory committee\u2014there are so many committees these days\u2014have said that they do n't believe that there is a case for a separate provision for eu students , as opposed to international students . but we want an immigration system that makes it as easy as possible for those students who want to benefit from education in wales , and indeed the uk , to be able to do so . lynne neagle am : thank you . llyr . llyr gruffydd am : so , what are we doing from now on in then ? are we just waiting to see or are we continuing to push ?"
