    "answer": "sian gwenllian am : i 'm not challenging the fact that you 've changed the performance measures\u2014i understand that , and having a broader way of looking is better in the long run . i 'm just saying , because there 's been this change , it makes it more of a challenge\u2014whilst accepting why you 've made the changes , but it does present more of a challenge , presumably , because you have to look at more indicators , and take evidence from different places . but i take it that you 're confident that the trajectory is going in the right way ."
