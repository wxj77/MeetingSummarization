    "answer": "project manager : okay . here we go . alright , the agenda for thi oh . alright . um the agenda for this meeting is um we 'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . and um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . i have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we 've made , given our options . and um evaluate the product , as a group . industrial designer : okay . project manager : and um so first we 'll have the prototype presentation . do you need the um powerpoint for this ? industrial designer : um yeah . i just got a few slides , so show them . project manager : alright . industrial designer : thank you . do you want to present it ? user interface : um industrial designer : yeah , here we are . user interface : this is what we came up with . it 's a pretty simple design . it 's um based on a mango ? yeah . and we marketing : industrial designer : mango shape . project manager : a mango . okay . user interface : yeah . and we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here industrial designer : the l_e_d_ . user interface : and this 'll be the power point , the on off button kind project manager : oh . okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : i 'm sorry . project manager : oops . marketing : what was the where 's the l_e_d_ ? user interface : it 's in the middle of one of the little r_s . marketing : oh . okay . user interface : and then the other one is the power . and uh we just have a simple design . we wanted it all to be industrial designer : so it 's palm-held . user interface : accessible from your thumb industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah palm-held project manager : yeah . user interface : and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb . project manager : notice you have a number ten button . user interface : so you do n't have to oh that was a mistake , was n't it ? project manager : okay . industrial designer : you just need the nought . user interface : right no , that 's a zero . marketing : user interface : take that one off . sorry . i was in charge of the numbers . project manager : no problem . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : ah . user interface : and this is just if you 've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . industrial designer : so one plus one would be eleven , user interface : you can go one , three or something . industrial designer : or project manager : oh . you press a plus button ? user interface : you press that first and then you go one three yeah . project manager : oh okay . i 've never heard of that kind before . user interface : well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah because if you on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you 'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . project manager : yeah . marketing : oh , there 's no e industrial designer : so if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . user interface : so the plus and then marketing : okay . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : but would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? user interface : no no , th all that 's why we have all these numbers . these numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine . project manager : yeah but i mean if you press , it 'll go to that channel right away . 'cause you got ta press the plus afterwards . user interface : yeah . oh no . uh , the plus is only for if you 're going past the number nine . project manager : yeah i know , but if if i wan na go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if i press the six it 'll go to channel six , and then i 'll press the plus , and then it 'll go to six and then put the five and it 'll go to sixty five ? marketing : sixty . user interface : you p oh . no you press the plus first . i i well it does n't we have n't really s i would 've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , marketing : user interface : but she says plus press which industrial designer : well i do n't mind , we can further define that . user interface : what do you think is simpler ? project manager : i th um user interface : it 's a industrial designer : i would n't have thought it 'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah it would n't be a problem . but i was just wondering industrial designer : but i suppose it 's not as snappy . user interface : yeah . project manager : like as long as we realise that 's what it 'll do . marketing : well the there is a there 's a delay on remotes i think . user interface : oops . yeah . marketing : where you can have it industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it 's like a five second input time . industrial designer : yeah . if you do n't put it marketing : so as long as you hit them dada industrial designer : yeah . yeah , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : that yeah . marketing : it should be fine . project manager : yeah . marketing : as long as there 's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . so industrial designer : um marketing : was there so on the top there is volume and industrial designer : and channel , user interface : a channel . industrial designer : which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like marketing : channel up volume up . okay cool . project manager : c_ and v_ . user interface : just so we can flick project manager : right , where um where 's the power button ? marketing : yeah . user interface : it 's in the middle of one of the little r_s . industrial designer : it 's the bigger r_ . marketing : it 's the r_ . project manager : oh okay . industrial designer : so it 's just like . user interface : yeah , project manager : yeah . user interface : so it 's all accessible . without m taking your hand off the remote . industrial designer : we deci project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : because we thought that 's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . project manager : oh okay . industrial designer : uh e ergonomics are all considered . project manager : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . user interface : and it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . marketing : industrial designer : it could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . user interface : okay . industrial designer : but yeah , no i mean it 's a different movement marketing : industrial designer : so yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um and the feel of it , i mean , we 've made this out of play doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . project manager : user interface : project manager : the spon yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-r_s_i_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and it just feels feels different . user interface : yeah . project manager : bit of a stress ball feel . industrial designer : would you like to feel it yourselves ? user interface : yeah . project manager : yes . i would . industrial designer : how it fits in the palm of your hand ? marketing : project manager : my goodness . industrial designer : thanks . marketing : project manager : there you go . industrial designer : and you ? project manager : genevieve ? yeah . marketing : . oh it 's nice . oh i think i killed the five . industrial designer : marketing : i did . project manager : and something hmm . marketing : i killed the four . oh god . industrial designer : o okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . user interface : of play doh yeah . marketing : oh it smells good . industrial designer : but we 're thinking that , seeing as we 're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . or the combination . um and we 're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , project manager : oh right . industrial designer : or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in user interface : 'cause it 'd be quite subtle and industrial designer : more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . project manager : yeah . it looks more think like vanilla and banana would . industrial designer : banana 's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black . project manager : okay yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . user interface : marketing : project manager : industrial designer : i mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the project manager : kinda christmas , you know . industrial designer : yeah , seasonal . user interface : yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer : apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki project manager : yeah . user interface : the pomegranate 's kinda girly and funky kind of , project manager : cool . user interface : and then the vanilla 's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . okay . um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , i mean you do n't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um , as we said the rubber 's probably used for comfort and anti-r_s_i_ and that 's about it . project manager : alright , thank you very much . user interface : project manager : good work everyone . marketing : bravo industrial designer : project manager : alright . and so now that we 've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : so , i have something i 'm going to oh wait a minute . marketing : you want the project manager : do you need to do a presentation first ? marketing : i do n't know what order it goes in . project manager : yeah . i 'm gon na check that out for a second . marketing : i have one . industrial designer : mm go project manager : what time is it anyw oh yeah sorry you 're right . evaluation criteria is next in line . marketing : evaluation cri okay . that 's me . project manager : yeah . marketing : hello . oh there we go . okay . come on my computer . come on . sorry my computer 's giving me technical difficulties . project manager : just press um function eight again . marketing : should i press it again ? last time i did that it sh okay . you 're right . project manager : and then again i think . one more time . marketing : oh . still not there . project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : okay now i think for this one i could would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe i 'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . um , we 're gon na be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we 've just seen . um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um i made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . um , and we 'll evaluate as to whether we 've s done what we set out to do . um and we 're gon na do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . so basically the lower p the lower the points the better . okay so question number one . does the remote whoops . sorry . oh i 'm not gon na be able um , i 'll do it on the whiteboard . i ca n't change it so i 'm g i 'm gon na ask you to push it down once . project manager : okay . marketing : i 'll write down our scores up on the okay so number one . do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? industrial designer : feel i think . we 've been quite successful with the rubber coating project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and project manager : the look is a little bit more playful . user interface : well industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah i guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it 's definitely different . project manager : oh definitely different yeah . marketing : it 's not your traditional yeah . industrial designer : i think the colour has a lot to do with it . i mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype are n't the colours that i think we would 've necessarily chosen . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : it 's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek project manager : oh you were only given red and black ? industrial designer : red , black and yellow , and orange . project manager : oh okay . user interface : yeah so industrial designer : um user interface : not very sleek and we do n't wan na go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . marketing : yeah . user interface : so we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . project manager : yeah . okay . industrial designer : but if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something user interface : yeah . a metallic-y finish we were thinking . industrial designer : well i know know it 's for rubber . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours i think it would look quite fancy . user interface : polished . okay yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . i kinda i like the potato look . project manager : it 's mango . industrial designer : oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . user interface : we we were we were thinking about marketing : it 's very different . it 's what ? project manager : it 's mango . marketing : oh sorry the mango the mango look . industrial designer : potato 's fine . potato 's fine . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . totally . it 's really adaptable . marketing : so i myself would say a one or a two . project manager : yeah . i would say two . personally . user interface : i w i 'd say two i think . marketing : it 's a two ? industrial designer : for the marketing : okay , user interface : fanciness . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : fancy marketing : one being true . so industrial designer : i uh two , three . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay , actu that 's pro that 's gon na get confusing , like that . okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? so i know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah and the use of the rubber . marketing : use of the rubber , the use of the l_e_d_ . industrial designer : for the anti-r_s_i_ . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the l_e_d_ use is n't particularly innovative marketing : is n't industrial designer : and we do n't have any scroll buttons , it 's all pushbuttons , there 's no lcd control , so if we 're thinking about the rest of the market , it 's sort of probably halfway . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : in some aspects it is , like we said . project manager : yeah . i 'd say maybe three . user interface : i 'll go for three as well . marketing : yeah . and i think i mean it it 's tough to say because we were we did n't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would 've defeated the purpose . project manager : yeah we want it simple . industrial designer : yeah . though it was our specification . user interface : no . would n't be simple , yeah . marketing : so i mean i we 'll put three , but i think we actually reached our goal . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : we did n't want it any more than that . okay question number three . uh , will it be easy to use ? project manager : i think so . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah very . marketing : yeah . user interface : i think one for that . marketing : yeah . s yeah project manager : yeah . one . marketing : i think it 's industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : you ca n't really get confused with that . i mean , there 'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . project manager : the plus number thing . user interface : yeah that 's the only thing yeah . marketing : but once that 's figured out , it should be fine . industrial designer : yeah and perhaps the turning on but user interface : marketing : number four . is this a good-looking remote ? remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . user interface : it 's definitely industrial designer : again i think the colour comes into this . project manager : yeah colour will definitely be a factor . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i think that the logo could be smaller . industrial designer : okay . project manager : and maybe not such a prominent way . user interface : yeah . project manager : maybe like at the bottom , kind of . user interface : but the industrial designer : not in user interface : remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . project manager : oh it just had to be on there i guess . marketing : whoops . user interface : yeah . marketing : should just not touch it . project manager : industrial designer : do n't worry . marketing : this time it 's the three i killed . i was just wondering if it should be like flatter . or industrial designer : i suppose i 've got quite big hands . project manager : i like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . marketing : well user interface : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : but you know what i 've just thought of there now . what where 's it gon na sit in your living room ? is it not gon na fall off the arm of the sofa ? project manager : maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like marketing : yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . user interface : yeah . project manager : round . user interface : but then it would n't sit as comfortably in your hand . marketing : oh . that 's true . project manager : it would still be comfortable i think . we c we could handle it i think . industrial designer : thing is like that , it 's not going anywhere particularly . user interface : yeah . marketing : maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , so you would n't loo like if it 's flat here , so it sits up . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : like that . user interface : oh that would be nice . project manager : ah it 'd fall over all the time though . it 'd be annoying . industrial designer : uh yeah , it 's less um , what 's th ha . user interface : yeah . marketing : i g if it 's weighted maybe . project manager : user interface : project manager : 'kay we 're done designing . industrial designer : h it 's got higher centre of gravity like that . marketing : details , details . project manager : come on . marketing : okay . so , is this a good-looking remote ? would we wan na show it off to our friends ? user interface : three . you would though , 'cause it 's bit it 's more interesting than other remotes . marketing : yeah . project manager : i think , it was another colour and it was like i think it 'd look okay . i think maybe a two . marketing : yeah ? industrial designer : i would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , marketing : i mean i gue yeah , it 's personal taste , but user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but definitely in another colour , i 'm not happy with those colours . marketing : okay , so should we say two for that ? project manager : sure . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah ? user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . uh , question number five . what 's um will people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product ? remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . user interface : i think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : so people do n't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , i do n't want to spend twenty five euros . project manager : yeah . user interface : we have to market it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it . industrial designer : and the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , user interface : and the kinetic energy part . yeah . project manager : yeah . durable . industrial designer : ooh no . marketing : shake it and the buttons fall off . industrial designer : but you know , those 'll be firmly on . user interface : do n't shake oh no the plus . you 're marketing : no , i guess , i do n't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , user interface : use the zero . industrial designer : user interface : make a new one . project manager : but you 're our marketing expert . marketing : but i know i am , are n't i ? user interface : i think they 're about ten po ten pound , are n't they ? about ten pounds . fifteen ? marketing : but you do n't have to buy batteries . so in the long term this can actually save you money . industrial designer : mm , yeah , that 's true . user interface : yeah . project manager : oh . exactly . exactly . marketing : so we 'll market it that way too . industrial designer : yeah . good point . marketing : so yeah i think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it 'll user interface : project manager : yeah . i would give it a two still though . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah . okay number six . can someone read it out ? industrial designer : does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . marketing : or user interface : yeah . marketing : um yeah . so that was mainly that the statistics industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i think it does very well . project manager : oh yeah . industrial designer : because marketing : we said industrial designer : yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . user interface : the zap project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and it 's just you wo n't have to think about it . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : you do n't have to look down to find them . marketing : industrial designer : they 're clearly there , easy to use . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : simple . user interface : uh marketing : yeah i guess the i think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but they 're not you and i really . project manager : yeah . marketing : so . okay so one ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . number seven . c heather could you push it down ? will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . project manager : we have the alarm system . marketing : now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ? user interface : yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it 'll vibra industrial designer : it yeah marketing : industrial designer : l lights on and , or flash as well . but i mean it 's not obviously obvious from the outside that that 's gon na happen 'cause you ca n't s particularly see an alarm . user interface : it 'll be again in the marketing . project manager : i thought the light from the inside was gon na light up . user interface : yeah . the light it will . project manager : or or was it gon na make a noise ? industrial designer : yeah . but when the alarm 's not user interface : but industrial designer : yeah . if you user interface : but both marketing : project manager : you press the button it makes a noise right ? marketing : it turns into a duck and starts quacking . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you could s project manager : yeah . awesome . awesome . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : oh , that would be brilliant . marketing : here i am . user interface : i 'd be tempted to industrial designer : well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , marketing : um industrial designer : i mean , when it when it lights up as we i mean it could light up when the alarm went . but if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there would n't be any point . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so you ca n't see the alarm , but it would light up . user interface : it would have to be in the market project manager : i though w it was gon na make a noise . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah . alarm , user interface : yeah but you still could n't see it . industrial designer : but you ca n't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself . user interface : it would just be a little speaker on the back or something . project manager : okay . marketing : we oh you 're just explaining why it 's not on the prototype . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . it w yeah . marketing : but yeah , it 'll be there . project manager : oh okay . marketing : so we can we could say that project manager : whoo . okay . industrial designer : sorry . user interface : marketing : we can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . project manager : yeah , totally . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . um industrial designer : sorry heather . user interface : project manager : no problem , mm . industrial designer : that was n't very clear . marketing : question number eight . will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . project manager : totally . marketing : so it has to be yeah , it 's eas they 'll pick it up and they 'll know what to do . user interface : so the plu the plus w once that 's written down on the page that 'll be really simple , marketing : the plus thing needs to be worked on . project manager : yeah . user interface : wo n't it ? industrial designer : i think marketing : yeah . industrial designer : just because it 's we 've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , i think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . marketing : well user interface : yeah . marketing : do does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? so then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . project manager : yeah , so it 's just like channel six , six , enter . user interface : that kind of annoys me though , when it 's zero six when you have to press project manager : yeah but you do n't have to press zeros . user interface : i do n't know why . marketing : you could just press six enter , user interface : oh okay . right . project manager : and then like twelve , enter . industrial designer : and or sixty six enter , y marketing : or one two enter . user interface : alright , aye . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah i think that 's probably more straightforward . yeah . good project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : um , okay so we can user interface : i 'd say w yeah one . marketing : we 'll say yes it 's uh one ? project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : ooh . mm . marketing : question number nine . uh , will it minimise the effects of r_s_i_ , which was repeated strain injury ? industrial designer : injury . user interface : yeah . marketing : um , which affected over a quarter of users . user interface : hmm . project manager : i think so . it 's like right in the user interface : but if you 're zapping project manager : your thumb might get a little bit uh industrial designer : yeah , that 's what i was thinking . user interface : yeah . i do n't think it will f industrial designer : we may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we do n't know about . user interface : yeah , project manager : yeah . user interface : the biology . project manager : but it is soft . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : it 's soft , project manager : and that 's kind of what the um marketing : and project manager : the powerpoint slide thing said would be good for r_s_i_ , marketing : and people could industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so maybe it is but marketing : i do n't know what other options there are . industrial designer : i think we 're getting project manager : yeah . industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : could i mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . but there 's not really any other options unless it 's like a keyboard . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so , i think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . project manager : yeah . marketing : so , one or two do you think ? industrial designer : i think user interface : i i 'd say t industrial designer : yeah , i think too . user interface : two . yeah project manager : yeah . marketing : two okay . okay number ten . did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? project manager : yes we did . industrial designer : user interface : yeah . marketing : now is the colour gon na be there even if it 's like vanilla ? user interface : n we we ca n't really do that marketing : is the yellow user interface : because for example on the banana theme we ca n't have it as being yellow . industrial designer : user interface : it wo n't stand out . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : so n it 's not always gon na be the same colour . marketing : it sounds like the colour 's something that we project manager : well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : gray , yeah . project manager : so it could be grey on the banana one . user interface : yeah , could be grey . project manager : yeah . marketing : but i mean the yell yeah d yellow 's ugly though , user interface : yeah that 's right , marketing : depending on the user interface : we did n't even rea marketing : so i think we 'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the r_r_ . industrial designer : mm . yeah . i think this is the user interface : yeah . industrial designer : the factor that we 've been least successful in confronting . marketing : okay . user interface : perhaps a metallic project manager : mm , yeah . user interface : or or like that 's grey , and it would n't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . no ? marketing : yeah . user interface : that is n't rubber . marketing : and the buttons in the middle . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay so , do you think that 's more of a three then ? three , four ? industrial designer : four i think . well i do n't marketing : four ? industrial designer : what do what marketing : well we have good reasons for it , so we but we can still put a a four ? industrial designer : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : okay , and final question . um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? industrial designer : user interface : marketing : current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . project manager : i would say so . marketing : user interface : following that briefing we did . project manager : but maybe more like two 'cause there 's no like pictures of fruit , it 's just sort of naming it by a fruit . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : with the with the colours . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : like um the colour scheme names and stuff . user interface : yeah . marketing : no , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? industrial designer : user interface : yeah . marketing : i think i missed a few project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : they are ? so you can have banana and kiwi and project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . okay , so that 's something that 's kind of in the making too , like maybe it 'll become more project manager : that 's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : it is . user interface : i think w yeah , i think one . well that was our brief and we followed the brief . industrial designer : the thing is , i think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , i do n't know if you 'd instantly say mango . user interface : well we have n't got a big banana but oh yeah . project manager : be like user interface : no . no . project manager : yeah . marketing : project manager : maybe if it was scented . user interface : oh that would be class . marketing : industrial designer : oh yeah . there we go . that would be great . project manager : yeah we have money for that . um user interface : project manager : alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? industrial designer : um marketing : yes we do . so i wh what was i gon na put for that ? a two for fashion ? project manager : i would say two . user interface : yeah . two . industrial designer : okay . marketing : okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven project manager : one point nine or something ? user interface : it 's industrial designer : it 's marketing : is user interface : yeah . project manager : i do n't know these things . um , between one and two . industrial designer : between one and two . marketing : between okay . industrial designer : so that 's pretty fantastic . user interface : close to two . marketing : um . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , that 's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . project manager : alright . user interface : i got marketing : does that seem right then ?
