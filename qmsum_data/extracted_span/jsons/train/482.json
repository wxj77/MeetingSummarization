    "answer": "industrial designer : maybe maybe we can make a tv guide on it , for the channel you 're on . marketing : i mean project manager : yeah , but it 's so marketing : yeah , but it should be li like this big , and i do n't think industrial designer : no , no , only the tv channel with the with uh with uh four programmes . project manager : i do n't think we should do it . industrial designer : you can uh zap through them with the page up page down button . marketing : yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large lcd screen , because industrial designer : yes , it can on your no , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . so why not on your remote ? project manager : yeah , but no . i do i think it 's a bit redundant , actually . marketing : yeah , i do n't know . project manager : and it 's also not i do n't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , user interface : well well what would you display on it then ? project manager : it 's industrial designer : uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide marketing : programme information . user interface : but is it is n't that a already on tv , a lot of new tvs ? marketing : but industrial designer : on t on teletext , yes . also on the internet . marketing : well a lot a lot of tvs indeed show uh when you uh zap to a industrial designer : but project manager : but you 're already watching the tv , you 're not gon na watch your remote control . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yes , but you also want to know what 's next . marketing : but then we also uh w need to bring out a line of tvs which we were planning to , user interface : yeah , project manager : user interface : and we also have to yeah . marketing : but whatever . because the tv has to send information back to the r_c_ , and i do n't know if that 's possible . industrial designer : yes , that 's uh really possible . project manager : marketing : yes , yes , o of course it 's possible , user interface : marketing : but you got ta uh implement it in the tvs , and i do n't think everyone 's gon na buy a real reaction tv within a month after the release of our uh remote control . industrial designer : project manager : i really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an lcd in it , user interface : and i also industrial designer : user interface : marketing : project manager : but i i really do n't think it 's a good n goo because it also does n't stroke with we wanted uh c when we talk about the materials , uh it 's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . it was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . marketing : yeah . project manager : but i do n't think a lcd display fits in that image . you know , it 's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know . marketing : that 's true , that 's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it 's not very solid , it 's uh frag fragile . project manager : yeah , yeah . you could make it , but it 's just it it does n't i do n't think it it 's coherent with the design we 're after . marketing : no . no . i do n't think so ei either . project manager : but that 's my opinion . well , you you y okay , we can vote for it . you want the lcd display . i do n't want to and he does n't , so it 's up to him . industrial designer : no . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : if we wan na user interface : yeah , i dunno . marketing : . ah . industrial designer : project manager : and i 've read somewhere that i 've got some kind of veto veto uh rights . user interface : . oh , okay . industrial designer : marketing : bastard . project manager : so i can also say user interface : we can you away . project manager : but did we skip the yeah , you could do marketing : project manager : m but what what i so what i but do you think we should user interface : yeah , i do n't know . uh , uh i i if it 's it 's a simple p project manager : we 're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . so user interface : no , that that 's right , industrial designer : no uh um user interface : and uh i also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . kind of lcd or something or industrial designer : y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions . marketing : yeah , i guess . user interface : but how does it display then ? w when i go to the second channel , what what does it show me ? industrial designer : uh , then you push a button . the title and the information about the programme . user interface : about that programme ? industrial designer : but but uh yeah , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be uh customised to the project manager : nah , that 's not gon na work . industrial designer : but maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first project manager : yeah . oh , well uh i 've seen it done before . industrial designer : you have the biggest uh project manager : do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d lcd displays , user interface : yeah . project manager : but then it 's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling . so it 's that that 's what i 've seen . industrial designer : yes , you can put uh a little lcd display on it with uh with lots of information . marketing : yeah , that 's true , if you uh yeah . project manager : but it just it j it does n't does n't match with the our whole basic concept . industrial designer : but uh i have n't thought about it . but whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh uh screen on top of it , it i it is n't vulnerable . project manager : well yeah , yeah , okay . that 's maybe not the most important , industrial designer : you can throw with it and project manager : but it 's just user interface : is it fashion ? project manager : i do n't think so . industrial designer : when when you put uh maybe a colour lcd t uh screen on it , it 's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from user interface : i do n't know . that 's not up to you . that 's up to market if i if it 's trendy . project manager : yeah , well do you ha do you have to you have n't looked after the trendiness of lcd displays , have you ? marketing : no . industrial designer : user interface : because our our motto is we put fashion marketing : well , i think it 's uh i think it 's pretty trendy , to be honest , uh but um i do n't know if if if well , i 'm coming back to the costs again , but i think uh we got ta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . and i think uh especially colour lcd , which is indeed pretty trendy . but i do n't think uh , i think it will be too expensive . industrial designer : but uh i 've got a the email with uh with the possibilities . and lcd was a possibility for the remote control . project manager : user interface : project manager : yeah yeah yeah . industrial designer : so why do n't we use it . project manager : yeah , but we 're gon na if it marketing : uh , did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh lcd or uh coloured lcd ? user interface : yeah , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . coloured marketing : yeah really , user interface : if you have black and white or something , or grey , that 's marketing : if y if you c i project manager : then uh then you better do n't yeah , d marketing : i in in two thousand and four you ca n't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme . project manager : user interface : marketing : really . industrial designer : no , but it does n't sa say anything about a colour or but , mm , i alf i also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it . but project manager : uh uh i really do n't feel the whole idea of an lcd display . industrial designer : i did n't think that project manager : i 'm sorry . it ca n't co you can not convince me . i do n't know how well how to with you guys , but i do n't really feel it . we already we 're uh user interface : it 's too much uh maybe uh with with the lcd and the docking station and project manager : yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets , marketing : yeah . project manager : and want and it uh uh , do it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft industrial designer : yes , but o on the marketing : w we 've we 've got ta find a balance , of course . user interface : with one thing special . marketing : and i think user interface : not a whole package of specialty . project manager : i do n't think i j uh , and really , i do n't see how the the lcd display is gon na add anything , you know , on a design level . uh , i think it 's slicker to have no l_ ceds . industrial designer : no , when y project manager : y we want to it 's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you do n't need an lcd . industrial designer : but it look yes , but that remote controls are already on the market . the simple project manager : it does n't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote . industrial designer : yes , but but when you want to have something special project manager : yeah , but we already have the docking station , which is industrial designer : yes , but you had a picture of it from another company . user interface : and uh the marketing : we have a pear . project manager : it has to be developed , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : but no , but it that 's industrial designer : project manager : that 's our that 's our killer feature . user interface : it 's just an it 's just an idea . marketing : project manager : that 's our what makes it special . user interface : it 's a it 's industrial designer : yes , it was already made . tha the remote control on the docking station . project manager : yeah , we 're gon na develop our own r n docking station . user interface : true . marketing : is that so ?

i d user interface : no , it 's too much . marketing : i think it 's a little too much , yeah . user interface : it 's overdone . project manager : okay , we s skip the lcd display . user interface : industrial designer : okay . marketing : okay . project manager : i 'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something . user interface : democratically . industrial designer : marketing : no . user interface : industrial designer : mayb marketing : . project manager : but industrial designer : i will rule the world with it . project manager : probably so ."
