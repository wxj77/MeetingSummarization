    "answer": "industrial designer : we have n't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . that depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um user interface : yeah . project manager : i think the microphone is on on the top , uh on the middle , the under the flip . industrial designer : yes , okay . uh-huh . project manager : so that will be the safe , so p any the chip it 's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to industrial designer : no , i mean it depends on the design of the circuit board . user interface : but it should n't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . project manager : uh it 's it 's yeah , but uh uh my opinion i think it 's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . but if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical i do n't think it 's uh feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . user interface : but if you 've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? i mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and i 'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , i can just use my voice . industrial designer : maybe i 've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and i 'm holding my cup of coca-cola in the other hand . user interface : yeah . and you do n't wan na let go of either one . marketing : i do n't wan na say . louder . yeah . user interface : i mean it does n't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . marketing : can also be on the side . project manager : yeah , the sides maybe is good . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so , i mean i can pass this around if anyone wants to project manager : yes . so it 's maybe good idea . industrial designer : yeah , y better you pass it around with a napkin . user interface : marketing : no , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would have n't been not be damaged or anything , and it 'd be accessible all the time to voice . user interface : yeah . project manager : yes . yeah . user interface : yeah , exactly . marketing : yeah . project manager : so it 's maybe good idea . s s industrial designer : it 's um it 's um marketing : compliments to the artist . industrial designer : you need to work on the weight a little bit . marketing : uh . project manager : okay . s i 'm fine , i 'm satisfi user interface : and maybe the shape of the buttons , project manager : i 'm satisfied . user interface : the little egg shapes are n't the most economical , but industrial designer : we 're glad you 're satisfied . project manager : of course it 's it 's it 's looks more heo heavy , but i think when it 's completely maybe it 's a less weight . user interface : yeah . i mean this is plasticene . there 's only so much you can do . we could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well . but and part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they do n't like something that 's too light , because they do n't feel like they have enough control over it . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so i mean maybe this is excessively heavy , but i think it needs to have some weight , it needs to feel like you 're still holding something . so that 's pretty much it for our presentation actually . project manager : that 's your uh prototype model ? user interface : yeah . project manager : okay , that 's good , thank you very much . marketing : project manager : so any comments or uh marketing : well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we 've we 've talked about on the previous meetings ."
