    "query": "<s> what did marketing and project manager come up with when it came to reducing buttons ?",
    "answer": "marketing : but uh yeah . it also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition project manager : marketing : and younger people say they would . and uh there was another section on our on the report for uh lcd displays , but the data was n't there , so . i do n't actually know what the results for that were , project manager : mm . right . mm . marketing : so . may be incrementally emitting , but yeah . project manager : yeah , i must say that um the uh i c ca n't remember what um f you know phone service i was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought marketing : and uh it would cut out the r_s_i_ as well if you project manager : and it it cuts out uh i was was gon na say , you ca n't get a lot of r_s_i_ , industrial designer : project manager : j just get jaw ache . okay , sorry . marketing : yeah , um oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . oh , i 've got some other things i could n't fit onto this presentation . um . you see this okay ? almost no ? it 's sorry it 's a bit . i 'll read out to you . uh functionality , uh like people 's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they 're used . so um like the power . using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on tv is a high relevance of nine , but it 's not frequently used . you see what i mean ? project manager : yeah . marketing : whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : is used the most . so m we can maybe even start to cut down on or i was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . so that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , which are low relevance project manager : mm-hmm . i mean marketing : and rarely used . and keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily user interface : it could be oh uh i was just gon na say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? have you seen the new mo mobile phones project manager : yeah . user interface : that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , marketing : oh yeah . user interface : you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something . project manager : hmm , hmm . marketing : yeah , like the one that like slides back project manager : uh . should we actually bite the bullet here ? marketing : and the buttons are concealed underneath . user interface : yeah . project manager : if people really do n't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether . marketing : just remove them completely ? project manager : we we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um user interface : that might be the project manager : i wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the um now the the age structure we were looking at um i mean w we had usage by age structure , what we did n't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . now do we know whether they marketing : uh yeah . project manager : forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . marketing : industrial designer : project manager : yes we marketing : um no this is for pay more for speech recognition . project manager : that would 've speech recogn right . so , we 're looking at um well again , we do n't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups . marketing : yeah , that 's true . project manager : if we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . industrial designer : p well the only problem i can think of with that is if you 've got a lot of people that do n't wan na be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . if you just kind of take away everything that they 're used to knowing , that 's gon na be quite a change . project manager : but if you just lift it up and say , channel one or b_b_c_ industrial designer : it might marketing : or even i mean you could even just have it left on . user interface : maybe i marketing : you could just put it down once on top your tv and never have to user interface : yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box project manager : user interface : and have it just go on the tv and then it does n't matter where in the room you are , you wo n't lose it . marketing : yeah . project manager : it c well it i can i can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , i_tv and you 're watching b_b_c_ then then it might um change itself , marketing : b_b_c_ one . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : oh . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : project manager : so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it user interface : yeah , that 's true . project manager : just to activate it . marketing : oh yeah . project manager : or or something just to identify that you 've lifted it up and it 's use . and and then just say , oh i do n't know , a thought and and then user interface : yeah . project manager : uh i mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . i mean if they were n't there , would people miss them ? marketing : mm-mm . industrial designer : but look at the importance of them . the volume settings . project manager : marketing : relevance of two out of ten , project manager : vol volume , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yes um industrial designer : they 're not used often project manager : th industrial designer : but they are quite important when they 're used . project manager : w we need to s identify things that people actually need industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and and it 's a function of frequency and relevance . and um i would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume and th w w given given that we 've been told to ignore teletext . uh channel and volume are the only ones that marketing : yeah . project manager : uh would appear to be essential . marketing : stand out . project manager : um . so if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it 's the yellow and grey , um and uh i dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . marketing : uh i just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . project manager : do , please . marketing : uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : we could maybe have like an activation word . project manager : you cer certainly could . marketing : 'cause i 've seen i 've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , project manager : depe uh i depends whether um marketing : you address the computer , and then give it a command . project manager : if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say marketing : oh i see . oh yeah , i see . project manager : b_b_c_ one . um okay , i mean you could print actually print it on the uh marketing : mm-hmm , yeah . project manager : device itself . um . marketing : i mean i 'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . project manager : s th this i th that 's always gon na be a problem i think . industrial designer : project manager : um and i i i s so i suppose one um could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : project manager : anyway , sorry , carry on . do you want to just carry on with or marketing : i i interrupted you , project manager : no no , no uh b i was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . marketing : sorry . oh okay . um well , i was just kinda wrapping up there . yeah , project manager : mm okay . marketing : i was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . we could make things much more f i think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we do n't really use much . alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . but , since if we 're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it 'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality ."
