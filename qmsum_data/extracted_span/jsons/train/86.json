    "answer": "sian gwenllian am : thinking about you as a minister trying to see what the long-term trends are with regard to raising standards and improving educational attainment , is that difficult , because the performance measures have changed , have n't they ? we ca n't compare like-for-like now , because of the changes that have been made in the way that performance is measured . so , to begin with , is that a challenge , to see whether progress has been made ? and secondly , what evidence do you as minister use to look at the long-term trends ? kirsty williams am : the first thing to say , with regard to changes to performance measures\u2014you 're right that change to those does make it , in some cases , more difficult to look at trends over a period of time . but those changes are made for really good reasons . if we change a performance measure , it is done to ensure that it is in the best interests of learners . and i think the best interests of learners always trumps the ease of comparison . i understand that , for researchers and for opposition members , even for ministers , it would be simpler to have the same set of measures over a period of time . but if we know that those things are driving behaviours that are unhelpful to children , and not in the best interests of children , then we have to change them , even thought that then does create challenges in different areas . with regard to what do we look at , there are a number of ways that we gain data and look at data in the system : everything from the categorisation system we spoke of earlier , and trends in categorisation ; we look at estyn reports ; we continue to look at examination results . but we 're trying to develop a broader range of data and statistics that give us a whole picture of the education performance , rather than narrowing down on one simple indicator that tells you one thing but does n't tell you everything . but i do n't know , steve , if there 's anything further that you 'd like to add . steve davies : it 's going back to what the member raised earlier , in terms of the range of things that you look at\u2014things that can make a difference . so , when estyn review schools , or we 're looking to develop national frameworks for things like mental health and well-being , which look to the practice that enables raising standards , it 's collecting that information , both at a national level , through the annual review of estyn , as well as our engagement with regions and local authorities . so , it 's looking at the evidence base that goes beyond , but impacts on data . and , inevitably , we will use the programme for international student assessment , and any other external assessments that come through organisations like the oecd . and even where we 've changed the performance measures , we still have , at national level , the ongoing data . so , if you looked at level 2 plus , we believe it is important that children get five good gcses\u2014for higher education and for employment . so , we 've not lost sight of those at a national level\u2014we 're not using them as a narrow set of performance measures for individual schools . kirsty williams am : so , if we look at\u2014level 2 plus is a good example . we know that a relentless focus on that single measure , as a way of judging the system , leads to a set of behaviours in schools . it narrows the focus onto a certain part of the cohort , it narrows the curriculum , when we know that children\u2014 sian gwenllian am : i 'm not challenging the fact that you 've changed the performance measures\u2014i understand that , and having a broader way of looking is better in the long run . i 'm just saying , because there 's been this change , it makes it more of a challenge\u2014whilst accepting why you 've made the changes , but it does present more of a challenge , presumably , because you have to look at more indicators , and take evidence from different places . but i take it that you 're confident that the trajectory is going in the right way . kirsty williams am : yes , i think we are making improvements . but you 're right : it does make it more challenging . but those changes are being made for the right reasons , as i said , whether that be at level 2 plus . look at english literature . i understand why perhaps a performance measure around english was introduced , but the effect of that was that significant numbers of children\u2014and , it must be said , usually children who are entitled to free school meals\u2014were suddenly not sitting english literature gcse . we 've changed that performance measure , and guess what ? last year , we saw a significant increase in the number of children that were sitting english literature gcse . for standards of literacy and oracy , i think studying literature is really , really important , before we even get into the joy of introducing children to the written word and the love of reading . so , we make changes . yes , it causes challenges , but we 're making those changes because we believe that they are in the best interest of children , and that has to trump ease of comparison . sian gwenllian am : why have you decided to ask the consortia , estyn and so on not to report on local data or regional level data ? how do we then come to conclusions about what is working if it is n't presented on a local authority and regional basis ? kirsty williams am : well , i think the thing to say about the communications from welsh government , estyn , and the wlga is it 's not about not communicating the data , it 's about challenging people on how that data should be used . so , the data is still available , but it 's a challenge to them about how to use that data . so , for instance , when we 're presenting data that compares local authority to local authority , you could have a local authority that says , 'there we go , i 'm above the national average . i do n't need to worry about the education in my local authority , because i 'm above the average , or i 'm better than my neighbour . ' that does n't necessarily mean that everything is right in your local education authority . perhaps your children should be doing even better than what you 're presented with . so , actually , it 's not about hiding data ; it 's about how you use the data appropriately . and sometimes , how we were presenting data in the past was lulling some people into a false sense of security about the performance of their system . so , it 's about how you use data , and that 's what the communication from welsh government and the wlga and estyn was about : think very carefully about this data and what it 's telling you about your system , and do n't be lulled into a false sense of security that you may be doing brilliantly . or , perhaps , looking at your data , you may think , 'oh , my goodness me , we 're not doing very well at all ' , but , actually , more careful consideration of that might show that your school 's impact on those children is really , really a positive one . so , you 've got to use that data in the context . so , it 's not about less data . if anything , it 's about more data and , crucially for me , it 's about more intelligent use and interrogation of that data , about truly what it 's telling you about your system . sian gwenllian am : but again , the welsh government\u2014 . you have continued to publish the local and regional level data . so , does n't that contradict what you 've been telling the consortia and everyone else ? kirsty williams am : no , not at all . as i said , we 're not in the business of trying to hide data\u2014i believe absolutely in full transparency . and in terms of level 2 data , i think i 'm not moving away from the point that i think it 's really important that more and more children get five really good gcses . i think it 's important for their life chances . it is about how that data is used , not about hiding data or making that data not available ."
