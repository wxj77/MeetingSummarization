    "answer": "marketing : so we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . and we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . and we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design . so seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they do n't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . and eighty percent of the people they are always l i mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . and the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . and seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . project manager : yeah . marketing : and fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they 're not used most of the times . user interface : yeah . yes . marketing : so this were the findings which we found . and also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the tv . user interface : yeah . marketing : and by the time they found the remote control the program is finished . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so they 're frustrated a lot user interface : marketing : and um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . industrial designer : mm , the functionalities yeah . marketing : so you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it 's quite difficult to learn if it 's too complex . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations i think this should be the solution for them . we should have an lcd on the rem remote control . industrial designer : well mm w well i i i do n't really see the advantage of having uh lcd on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . user interface : big screen . industrial designer : it 's marketing : mm-hmm ? industrial designer : yeah of course it 's fancy trendy and so on but it 's it 's expensive to produce and it 's not really marketing : i mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so if we have a lcd on the remote , rather than looking onto the tv you just look into a remote and navigate it . it 's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control . user interface : mm yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah . user interface : mm . the thing marketing : we just play around industrial designer : yeah but when you play with the ipod you do n't have a big screen in front of you , s project manager : you can use this screen instead of the big se screen , user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : instead of use the yeah . user interface : if you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the lcd , after all the lcd just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the lcd , marketing : yeah . user interface : maybe even better . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so marketing : i mean this were the points which we got from the market demands . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so i th i i well i think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh user interface : yeah . more on a fancy design . marketing : yeah that 's fine . industrial designer : on the speech recognition if the technology is available marketing : yeah . i mean that 's user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but well i think lcd will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . user interface : mm . remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but yeah . user interface : yeah . so i is marketing : uh yeah we have uh user interface : so the thing is you can find out how much an lcd will cost and then we 'll decide again . marketing : i mean that should be found out by the industrial designers . project manager : industrial designer : user interface : uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time . is i if i industrial designer : so price of uh lcd display . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and marketing : and it 's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . user interface : yeah . and also the cost for the speech recognition . project manager : mm . it 's for user interface : ask our r_ and d_ department . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it 's just for small vocabulary . we it 's not user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah it 's o only for a limited vocabulary , project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . and ho marketing : say eighty commands or so . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah okay . user interface : and also the scroller button , how much will it cost . industrial designer : and well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . project manager : yeah . push push . marketing : mm , the scroll button , from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . industrial designer : yeah . yeah i think that marketing : because they they just they 're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah i i i think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button user interface : do n't use the buttons . industrial designer : so uh i think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality . user interface : yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . project manager : it does n't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important . marketing : yeah . user interface : important . industrial designer : yeah . but project manager : but they are just less used compar marketing : they 're not used much . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the tv screen user interface : yeah . industrial designer : like uh a a list of function user interface : yeah . mm . industrial designer : and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate user interface : yeah , yeah . so so the at most more power uh . industrial designer : and you project manager : or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : industrial designer : but if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the tv screen i think that just five buttons are sufficient , one to go up left right down and uh enter user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . user interface : mm . mm . yeah . industrial designer : you do n't have to to switch to a channel to another uh user interface : yeah . marketing : or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a lcd on the remote not on the television . because when you have the lcd onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands . industrial designer : yeah but marketing : so if you have then lcd in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the lcd displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . industrial designer : yeah but if you look at the lcd you you do n't look at the tv screen marketing : and accordingly you can just increase or decrease . project manager : it 's user interface : mm . mm . industrial designer : so i i it 's not really worth to get to have the image if you do n't look at , so . user interface : i if mm . mm . project manager : and i think it 's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use lcd . i user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah that has to be checked out . user interface : i think that there 's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you do n't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wan na control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button industrial designer : user interface : and the same for the volume and the channel , marketing : yeah . user interface : if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you do n't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for lcd , marketing : okay . user interface : with the help of speech recogniser you can marketing : i mean , better if we could just check all the cost with lcd user interface : yeah . marketing : and also with the speech recognition . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case . user interface : mm . mm . yeah . a and marketing : and the third problem was to find the remote control . always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes . industrial designer : well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t project manager : you will listen to a peep , special peep . user interface : where , yeah . marketing : yeah that 's right , that 's exactly what i mean by voice commander . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : or it could be also something like this , user interface : yeah . marketing : uh it 's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so we have some one charger there and whenever we do n't use the remote control we put it in the charger . user interface : put it back at the charge . industrial designer : put user interface : yeah . marketing : and when we 're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . and that 's a good idea , that 's simple , like in phones . project manager : yeah . marketing : i mean it doe it also does n't require a voice command , project manager : but you do n't you do n't have to move the the charger . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : because there are problems with a voice command . user interface : hmm . mm . th yeah . mm yeah . yeah . mm . marketing : yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager : you have to keep it . marketing : i mean charger would be fixed industrial designer : yeah . marketing : because it 's always with electricity plugged . industrial designer : yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery . also and uh uh the remote is lost . project manager : okay . user interface : mm . there 's mm . mm . marketing : user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah that 's right . user interface : that we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off tv button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . you never get it lost industrial designer : yeah . user interface : because uh every time you 're off the computer the tv you are asked the the command the tv com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger . marketing : it 's an good reminder , user interface : yeah . so you will never get lost yeah . marketing : yeah that 's right . industrial designer : okay . project manager : maybe for some people lazy people . user interface : yeah . yeah because everything is programmed inside . project manager : yeah yeah . user interface : so it 's it 's uh it 's all about strategy , y marketing : and of course the final point is a fancy look . as we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by norman they were n't fancy , industrial designer : they were ugly . user interface : yeah , yeah . marketing : i mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons . industrial designer : they marketing : i think we should have something it industrial designer : well the last one with the um yeah with the two parts was uh original , so user interface : with uh two two two parts controller . marketing : i mean uh i mean uh i mean uh you see if it 's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it , you ca n't avoid him . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but you can have an button for child lock . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he ca n't use even user interface : mm . mm . mm . mm . industrial designer : well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the tv you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . marketing : mm uh project manager : or user interface : mm . yeah . mm . marketing : that 's right . project manager : or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just yeah just push uh kids button so it 's automatically user interface : mm . these are probl yeah . mm . mm . mm . project manager : . so if he . marketing : i think these other four points they 're the market demands and so it 's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think industrial designer : so for mm project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . so for my part i will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . marketing : yeah i think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : mm . i think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser industrial designer : yeah . user interface : because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by tv programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . if numbers , they 're easy , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : but if name the channel by by name industrial designer : well i think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the tv you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now and and uh marketing : no , we have a problem there . you see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you 've just say twenty five project manager : yeah it 's yeah . marketing : and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five . industrial designer : that 's right , yeah , yeah . marketing : so i think there should be a prefix to some numbers industrial designer : well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the tv so . user interface : yeah . marketing : i mean the the you just check all the probability that saying tv twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . industrial designer : yeah yeah . marketing : ordinary twenty five you almost there 's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent industrial designer : yeah but well okay . marketing : and tv twenty five i dunno it will be round about one or two percent . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so it 's better to have some prefix before the number . user interface : but i i i think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . marketing : yeah something , some code . user interface : you say numbe channel number five of the tv correspond to something else in the channel . industrial designer : yeah yeah . user interface : so some people may want to say , i want to see this channel . industrial designer : mm mm . well i marketing : that will be too big . project manager : or just marketing : and it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . user interface : yeah . check with the v r_ and d_ department the capability of recogniser . project manager : it 's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . it will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . user interface : uh ? project manager : because you have to s t uh a ch user interface : well , it 's convenient for the user . project manager : yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . marketing : als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . project manager : or maybe industrial designer : yeah . marketing : then project manager : or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , user interface : the uh uh mm . mm . project manager : just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . user interface : i i think that i have mm mm i think there 's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the tv screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let 's say it 's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want marketing : yeah , the . user interface : and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . so project manager : or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . user interface : mm . so you you do n't use the speech recogniser in that way . project manager : no . just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . user interface : oh , okay . yeah . industrial designer : well i uh i also project manager : by associating each channel with the name or industrial designer : i i also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching tv project manager : and for each one has his own . user interface : industrial designer : the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . marketing : yeah yeah , . industrial designer : because uh i remember when i was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time project manager : or you have to s user interface : yeah , i wan na watch this , i wan na watch that . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so it 's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching tv and say oh tv thirty and just run , s marketing : a and in the same lines we would have a one more problem . if we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : so i think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah . marketing : yeah that 's right that should be an option . industrial designer : yeah that 's well i think that 's a good uh a good option because it 's simple and uh simple to implement also , so . marketing : i think these are the practical problems . so we need to take care of them in the design . project manager : maybe we 'll discuss them in next meeting ."
