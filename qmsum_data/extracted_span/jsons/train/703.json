marketing : oops . project manager : i exp i s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em , right , everyday . industrial designer : yeah , of course , using remote control . yeah . project manager : and um now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you did n't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , you know , things like that ? user interface : yeah , i industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yes , i i feel that all the remote should be very compact . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : small , right . mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , those which we get here nowadays it 's very long . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and um and it should have multi-purpose . like uh the remote control which we use for tv , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : audio player . oh . okay . project manager : so it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically . user interface : yes , exactly yes . industrial designer : divides us user interface : yeah . exactly . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : at um twelve fifty euros per user interface : industrial designer : project manager : well . marketing : well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : we certainly can try to i agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . project manager : it should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . marketing : that 's right . project manager : now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , of course . user interface : yeah , design should be , yeah it should be different . all the almost all the remotes project manager : like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . user interface : yes , exactly . industrial designer : yeah , maybe ten i do yeah , colours user interface : are different shapes . industrial designer : and al shapes also . yeah . project manager : um so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know . industrial designer : yeah of course yeah . marketing : yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . project manager : yeah . marketing : i think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , because i think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . they ca n't find it . project manager : that is true , user interface : project manager : because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . marketing : industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the tv off and they say , where the hell is my my remote control yeah ? marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : project manager : well or yeah or if it 's really , if it 's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . marketing : so some industrial designer : yeah , some beep or something like that , project manager : yeah . mm-hmm . user interface : or a b marketing : uh so , so it 's really the beep or , or a light should blink . industrial designer : so that we can go project manager : so if lost if lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know . user interface : should ha industrial designer : yeah . user interface : a fluorescent signal , yeah . marketing : mm 'kay . industrial designer : yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . project manager : exactly , i mean just that 's what i 'm saying . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . may not be beep . project manager : i 'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it 's a beep or whether a light or industrial designer : beep or uh it 's a light , maybe it 's a light . marketing : and do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? project manager : okay , my my idea is maybe that the minute it 's really hidden , in in other words if it 's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it 's behind a plant , at that moment it 's it 's like , it 's like um , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : in in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , marketing : okay so okay . project manager : i mean , that we can discuss that later , you know . industrial designer : yeah , probably yeah , probably it 's a yeah , yeah . user interface : yeah . and uh marketing : so the light sensor would activate the signal . project manager : that 's right . you know there would be industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : right you have to have some kind of sensor and i i think uh voice or clapping it 's not specific enough . uh i know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but i think they only work to certain degree and marketing : but it could be someplace really obvious and you still would n't be able to find it . project manager : what with industrial designer : yeah , of course , that did n't user interface : then , in that case marketing : well , because you 're s because you 're silly . because people are silly . industrial designer : i i we ca n't do it . project manager : oh yeah well , but then those people we ca n't help everybody . marketing : i mean it could be on well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table industrial designer : marketing : um , project manager : okay we have uh marketing : you know , well maybe we have to move along , okay . project manager : yeah , we have to move along , but i think we have some good good points to start with here . industrial designer : yeah , good point . project manager : okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . i think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this ?
