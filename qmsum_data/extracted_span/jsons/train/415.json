    "query": "<s> what did jassa scott and janet finch-saunders agree on the priority of the inspections ?",
    "answer": "janet finch-saunders am : so , what is the cycle of inspections for regional consortia , and how robust are those inspections ? what areas do you cover ? jassa scott : well , regional consortia are n't actually statutory entities at the moment , and we do n't have specific inspection powers relating to regional consortia . what we have are powers to inspect school improvement . so , on each of our local authority inspections , there will be , usually , an area that we 're looking at that relates to school improvement , and that would involve us looking at the work of the consortia that the local authority has commissioned . what we 've agreed with welsh government is that , over the next few years , we will take a thematic approach . so , the first area that we 've said is that we 'll look specifically at how each of them is supporting curriculum reform , and report on that . so , that will report specifically on the different ones , but it would n't be the same as doing an inspection of their work at this time . janet finch-saunders am : should they be on a statutory footing ?"
