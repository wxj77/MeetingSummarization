    "query": "<s> what did project manager think of the symbol and colour of the remote when discussing the design of the remote ?",
    "answer": "user interface : oh . um . okay so i 'm gon na talk a bit about the technical functions design . i 'm louisa , the user interface designer , as you know . um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . um here are two example remotes . um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so i think they incorporate a kind of video function which we wo n't have to worry about . uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . um so my personal preference would be the right remote . so , it 's got nice big buttons , it 's got a very limited number of buttons . um they 're nice , kinda clearly labelled . um i like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . so it 's very very user friendly , and it 's got a little splash of colour . could maybe do with some more colour . um . project manager : well there 's a couple of things there . um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . so basically we 'd have to uh we 'd have to be putting that on um the the product . user interface : hmm . do we get to see that ? project manager : i have n't as yet , no . user interface : will you be presenting that in a bit ?"
