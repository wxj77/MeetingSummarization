    "answer": "project manager : uh okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . um i 'm the project manager so i 'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : project manager : um that 's , we 've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for tv . um that 's because uh it will be too complex user interface : okay . project manager : and the time to market will be too big , if we wan na have it uh for more functions . so it has to be simple . uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . and uh it 's a function we do n't need in our remote control . marketing : project manager : um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . uh that 's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . um this is uh a bit pity for the marketing uh expert . marketing : user interface : project manager : because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . so we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control , and the other way round . and we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . and uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . so i suggest let 's have a discussion on the control functions . yeah . marketing : so is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? project manager : uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wan na use and the market we wan na reach with our product . um user interface : mm . marketing : yeah 'cause you 're you 're saying that teletext is gon na be an old feature and it 's not gon na be used anymore anyway pretty soon . and new tvs will have internet access on them . project manager : marketing : but i think if you 're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a tv with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . user interface : yeah . marketing : in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . so i think it 's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . i 'm pretty much against it . project manager : against the no teletext ? marketing : yes . project manager : um marketing : besides that , i think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . but i mean if i s if i see this , it 's i think we 're just gon na go for another project manager : yeah it 's it is user interface : forty project manager : standard remote . marketing : pretty project manager : no i think we can marketing : and not innovative project manager : i think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons marketing : remote control . project manager : which were also mentioned . uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wan na reach because it is forty percent of the market . user interface : yeah . project manager : and um if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it 's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . marketing : yes but it 's not the biggest part of the market . and besides that , they 're not very critical so i mean they do n't really care what the remote control is like . they 'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . project manager : but do n't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think the people think that 's the the device i 've looked for although i did n't realise it . user interface : project manager : so let 's try it . marketing : no . i think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control . user interface : yeah . marketing : people of forty plus , i mean they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it 's okay with them . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i think that if we 're if we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um i do n't know if you 've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? marketing : so project manager : yeah . it 's a big success . industrial designer : yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , i think . project manager : very big success . marketing : i have n't heard of it . project manager : yeah . uh . i think so as well . industrial designer : we do n't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . we just change our focus on the project , and i think we can uh we can sell this ."
