    "answer": "phd a : yeah . professor f : so the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig um robert did n't bring it today but there 's a a belief - net which is there 's a first cut at a belief - net that that does n't it is n't fully uh instantiated , and in particular some of the the combination rules and ways of getting the the conditional probabilities are n't there . but we believe that we have laid out the fundamental decisions in this little space phd a : mm - hmm . professor f : and the things that influence them . so one of the decisions is what we call this ave thing . do you want to um access , view or enter a thing . so that 's a a discrete decision . phd a : mm - hmm . professor f : there are only three possibilities and the uh what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to add which of those it is and give it to the planner . phd a : mm - hmm . professor f : but , uh th the current design suggests that if it seems to be an important decision and if the belief - net is equivocal so that it does n't say that one of these is much more probable than the other , then an option is to go back and ask for the information you want . phd a : mm - hmm . professor f : alright ? now there are two ways one can go a imagine doing that . for the debugging we 'll probably just have a a drop - down menu and the while you 're debugging you will just ok . but for a full system , then one might very well formulate a query , phd a : mm - hmm . professor f : give it to the dialogue planner and say this , you know ar are you know you are you planning to enter ? or whatever it whatever that might be . so that 's under that model then , there would be a uh um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query , presumably give it to you . that would get expressed and then hopefully you know , you 'd get an answer back . and that would of course the answer would have to be parsed . grad d : mmm . yep . professor f : right and ok so , th that uh , we probably wo n't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that . but while we 're on the subject i just wanted to give you a sort of head 's up that it could be that some months from now we said `` ok we 're now ready to try to close that loop `` in terms of querying about some of these decisions . phd a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yep . so my suggestion then is that you um look into the currently ongoing discussion about how the action plans are supposed to look like . and they 're currently um agreeing or or in the process of agreeing on an x m l - ification of um something like a state - transition network of how dialogues would proceed . and the these um transition networks uh will be what the action planner interprets in a sense . professor f : hmm . d did you know this robert ? grad b : uh michael is doing that , right ? phd a : well uh marcus lerkult is actually implementing that stuff and marcus and michael together are um leading the discussion there , yeah ."
