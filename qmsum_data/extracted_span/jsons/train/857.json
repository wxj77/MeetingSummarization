    "answer": "user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : these these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so but le let us see first the new requirement . so we do n't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we do n't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that user interface : but teletext is just one button . project manager : yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff . user interface : you you just write the write the numbers . project manager : yeah . so well user interface : so will you add with the channel keys , right ? project manager : yeah . so anyway we do n't have to include this feature because it 's it 's not used any more by users , user interface : so . project manager : they prefer to s user interface : i am . i 'm sure that uh it do n't like but uh i do n't see just one button . project manager : yeah . i dunno . if i one button is still one more button . if if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : well anyway i have this point . we can discuss . also um so as as i told before uh it would be better if it 's only for the tv um because we want to be quick on on the market . and then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . so this is the the key point . marketing : project manager : so before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera ."
