    "answer": "professor b : that 's yeah , that 's a good thing grad a : that 's right . professor b : because then y you just write the `` do `` - loops and then you pretend that you are working while you are sort of you c you can go fishing . phd e : and two gigs of memory . phd c : yeah . phd e : yeah . grad a : pretend , yeah . phd e : exactly . yeah . phd d : go fishing . phd e : see how many cycles we used ? professor b : yeah . then you are sort of in this mode like all of those arpa people are , right ? phd e : yeah . professor b : uh , since it is on the record , i ca n't say uh which company it was , but it was reported to me that uh somebody visited a company and during a d during a discussion , there was this guy who was always hitting the carriage returns uh on a computer . phd e : uh - huh . professor b : so after two hours uh the visitor said `` wh why are you hitting this carriage return ? `` and he said `` well you know , we are being paid by a computer ty i mean we are we have a government contract . and they pay us by by amount of computer time we use . `` it was in old days when there were uh of pdp - eights and that sort of thing . phd e : oh , my gosh ! so he had to make it look like professor b : because so they had a they literally had to c monitor at the time at the time on a computer how much time is being spent i i i or on on this particular project . phd e : yeah . how idle time . grad a : yeah . phd e : yeah . professor b : nobody was looking even at what was coming out . phd e : have you ever seen those little um it 's it 's this thing that 's the shape of a bird and it has a red ball and its beak dips into the water ? professor b : yeah , i know , right . phd e : so if you could hook that up so it hit the keyboard professor b : yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . phd e : that 's an interesting experiment . professor b : it would be similar similar to i knew some people who were uh that was in old communist uh czechoslovakia , right ? so we were watching for american airplanes , coming to spy on on uh on us at the time , phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : so there were three guys uh uh stationed in the middle of the woods on one l lonely uh watching tower , pretty much spending a year and a half there because there was this service right ? and so they very quickly they made friends with local girls and local people in the village and phd e : yeah . professor b : and so but they there was one plane flying over s always uh uh above , and so that was the only work which they had . they like four in the afternoon they had to report there was a plane from prague to brno basically f flying there , phd e : yeah . professor b : so they f very q f first thing was that they would always run back and and at four o ' clock and and quickly make a call , `` this plane is uh uh passing `` then a second thing was that they they took the line from this u u post to uh uh a local pub . and they were calling from the pub . and they but third thing which they made , and when they screwed up , they finally they had to p the the p the pub owner to make these phone calls because they did n't even bother to be there anymore . and one day there was there was no plane . at least they were sort of smart enough that they looked if the plane is flying there , right ? and the pub owner says `` oh my four o ' clock , ok , quickly p pick up the phone , call that there 's a plane flying . `` phd e : yeah . professor b : there was no plane for some reason , phd e : and there was n't ? professor b : it was downed , or and so they got in trouble . but . but uh . phd e : huh ! well that 's that 's a really i professor b : so . so . yeah . phd e : that would n't be too difficult to try . professor b : yeah . phd e : maybe i could set that up . professor b : yeah . phd e : and we 'll just professor b : well , at least go test the s test the uh assumption about c - c - one i mean to begin with . but then of course one can then think about some predictable result to change all of them . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : it 's just like we used to do these uh these uh um the the uh distance measures . it might be that uh phd e : yeah , so the first set of uh variance weighting vectors would be just you know one modifying one and leaving the others the same . professor b : yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . phd c : yeah . maybe . phd e : and and do that for each one . professor b : because you see , i mean , what is happening here in a in a in a in such a model is that it 's tells you yeah what has a low variance uh is uh is uh is more reliable , phd e : that would be one set of experiment professor b : right ? how do we phd e : wh - yeah , when the data matches that , then you get really professor b : yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . phd e : yeah . right . professor b : how do we know , especially when it comes to noise ? phd e : but there could just naturally be low variance . professor b : yeah ? phd e : because i like , i 've noticed in the higher cepstral coefficients , the numbers seem to get smaller , right ? so d phd c : they t phd e : i mean , just naturally . phd c : yeah . professor b : yeah , th that 's phd c : they have smaller means , also . uh . phd e : yeah . exactly . and so it seems like they 're already sort of compressed . phd c : uh - huh . phd e : the range of values . professor b : yeah that 's why uh people used these lifters were inverse variance weighting lifters basically that makes uh uh euclidean distance more like uh mahalanobis distance with a diagonal covariance when you knew what all the variances were over the old data . phd e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . hmm . professor b : what they would do is that they would weight each coefficient by inverse of the variance . turns out that uh the variance decreases at least at fast , i believe , as the index of the cepstral coefficients . i think you can show that uh uh analytically . phd e : mm - hmm ."
