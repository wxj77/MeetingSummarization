    "answer": "project manager : so is why not save that . marketing : no , you 'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . project manager : do you want to replace existing file , no . i actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but marketing : yeah , you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that 's the save one is n't it , so and then find it . project manager : spreadsheet . marketing : project manager : yeah , but i 've ta uh marketing : project manager : right , i 'll just re-do it . that 's the easiest way . right . user interface : well we 've made our prototype anyway . we can have a good look at that . marketing : you pass it round to have a look . user interface : mm-hmm . y no , it 's a slightly curved around the sides . marketing : mm very nice . user interface : um , it 's almost curved like up to the main display as well . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and we 've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top . user interface : marketing : so it is , yeah . industrial designer : marketing : cherry would be alright actually . user interface : yeah , marketing : yeah . user interface : it 's a bit more fun , is n't it ? and it 's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , we might get a marketing : mm-hmm . copyright , yeah . what 's this this one ? user interface : yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . marketing : what 's that one there ? user interface : ah , that 's the mute . industrial designer : for the m_ . marketing : oh , okay . right . user interface : it it 'd probably have to be labelled mute . marketing : industrial designer : they 're thinking user interface : but um , we did n't have anything small enough to write . marketing : uh-huh . industrial designer : for the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons . marketing : okay . mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them . marketing : user interface : um , the important ones are the volume ones . so we made them a bit bigger . the mute could possibly be a bit smaller . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you 've got the volume in orange on design there , user interface : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and the the channel is in blue . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : r right . um , user interface : yeah , and we chose a v_ plus and v_ minus . project manager : all these things have cost implications . and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . so however , i 've now . but um , yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that , marketing : i 'll see if i can find them . project manager : and uh as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , i suppose . industrial designer : yeah , sis user interface : well the colours would n't like that 's they would n't be too important , marketing : have user interface : but we did n't have any white play-doh . so that 's where the colour buttons came from . project manager : an important consideration . marketing : project manager : right , okay so um and the second one underneath would be the idea for the industrial designer : yes , we 'll have the slide-away . project manager : right , okay . so we 've got um detail design meeting . industrial designer : bottom . project manager : right . so so , we 've got prototype presentation , which we 've just done , evaluation criteria , um and finance , so i guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we 're looking for uh from um our previous meeting . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : project manager : so other than the fact that it does n't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : project manager : but other than that , we got the red apple . we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , industrial designer : yes , yes . project manager : and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . and the and the cost implication . industrial designer : okay . marketing : right . project manager : the only snag about this is that uh the cost is probably kind of important . so um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : um , and whether it would uh marketing : so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ? industrial designer : this this is a user interface : uh , that 's it . industrial designer : yes , this is our presentation of the prototype . marketing : that 's the pr project manager : right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half euros . marketing : okay . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : so , there 's no redesign . so that should uh right , so , seems to me that the thing that i have to do is is quickly find that uh industrial designer : could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ? marketing : we should plug it in . project manager : right . marketing : do you wan na plu do you wan na plug it in into the the back of that one . project manager : okay . industrial designer : 'kay , alice . so , sh marketing : we could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . project manager : right . . industrial designer : 'kay this should be then . project manager : okay , so , by the fact that we 've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we 've got a single curved case . we 've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we 're having rubber buttons and industrial designer : mm-hmm . have a push button interface . project manager : okay . w the button supplements . industrial designer : um project manager : well , originally , i thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . but industrial designer : um project manager : so the so the real w the real question then would come in . do you make all the buttons marketing : well do we 'll do it on the prototype , so do two , see how much it is . project manager : well , so we 've got one special button form , which was the apple . everything else is gon na be a standard . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : we 've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , industrial designer : and then we 'd have project manager : so , i was originally , i was thinking rubber was n't special , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but according to this , maybe it is . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so and the r i mean effectively we 've got sixteen buttons that we 're gon na have on there . marketing : yeah . i think you just do one , do n't you , for the project manager : w i do n't know is is is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore i mean , what 's the op the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore marketing : i think i think it 's just it 's just a one . else project manager : whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic . marketing : i thi i think i think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button . i do n't know though . project manager : i would every design change is uh sound ] i dunno , um okay , um , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , i guess . we 'd have one special colour and one special button form . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and when i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . as far as i know , that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and if what happened ? marketing : you 've just gone off the window into another one . it 's on the bottom row . user interface : maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . project manager : user interface : yeah . project manager : now , right . user interface : project manager : okay , so , but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so that 's nine point one there so we 've got some project manager : so it well , is it s is no , it 's nine point seven i 've got . industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay . industrial designer : just give us a bit of project manager : so , that would that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : and there 's nothing else as far as i can see that we we had uh planned to put on . marketing : industrial designer : i switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . at the moment we 've just got the simple chip , which costs one . project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : um , i guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech marketing : yeah . project manager : well , hold on . um , if we okay , that gives us twelve point seven industrial designer : so uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition project manager : but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the industrial designer : without project manager : oh , i see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and industrial designer : yeah , yeah . user interface : um , . d would n't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? you know how you turn that one to a zero , would n't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , marketing : yeah , we have to have it industrial designer : oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe . user interface : so you need both of them ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : maybe um we 'd be giving up on the kinetic . um project manager : and go for battery instead . marketing : yeah . project manager : that would give you one less . industrial designer : we should yeah , that would save us one , though we 'd still be slightly ov project manager : but you reckon that i i mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . well , since it 's the through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . um , whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and then still have the batteries , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : or whatever they would prefer not uh you know what i mean ? the the problem was the battery 's running out and losing the um losing the remote . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so you got ta decide which of those is more important to them . project manager : but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? in a sense , at the moment , we 've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two . user interface : i think the voice recognition . project manager : at least . remember that was a minimum requirement . the other option if we 're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it originally , we 're gon na make it a simple product . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we 've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? project manager : mm-hmm . makes sense . marketing : okay . right um , i have a little thing . so , we 've all got a note of it 's thirteen point seven , is n't it , with everything we want on . project manager : . sorry , do you want that back up ? marketing : yeah , i just had a presentation to do . project manager : right . user interface : but i do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it 's got no battery . project manager : okay , but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . marketing : mm-hmm . mm . right okay um , this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we 've got here . user interface : marketing : and so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we 've formulated . and those ones are gon na be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , i guess . and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it 's neither true nor false , then that 's four . so , i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . um so , we have to say whether it 's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . um the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . whether it 's easy to use . whether it 's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . and whether it 's a sort of recognisable real reaction product . and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , industrial designer : okay . marketing : so i 'll go over here . right . so the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . so if we do a sort of a one so industrial designer : okay , well we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product 's quite good . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so uh marketing : okay . industrial designer : um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . marketing : yeah . yeah . yeah . industrial designer : um , sorry that 'd be considered fancy . user interface : yeah , i 'd maybe give it a a two . marketing : of but i think what is one false , or is t one true ? user interface : one 's true . marketing : i forgot . one 's true , and okay . seven 's fal user interface : and a four is neutral . marketing : four is neutral , okay . so industrial designer : so maybe maybe a two . user interface : yeah , 'cause we have n't got the double curve , so we ca n't like say it 's completely true . project manager : go for one . yep . marketing : right . user interface : but it 's pretty close . we 've got almost everything we can . marketing : okay . right . project manager : okay . marketing : i gon na put underneath so i 've got some more space . so , false is seven , true is one , and so uh say about a two for fancy , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : you think ? project manager : yeah , why not not , marketing : okay . project manager : m m maybe nearer three . marketing : okay , well d you do an average at the end , i do n't know . um project manager : two three . well , it 's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down , we 've got solar power , we 've got uh various other things you could have , and we 're not going for these options . marketing : uh-huh . this this is just this is just for like the look . does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . so project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . marketing : yeah , so that so sh should we go for a a two on that ? project manager : okay . marketing : 'kay . and i mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? industrial designer : um , deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . marketing : d yeah . okay . so , what about the pr the prototype as it is , industrial designer : um marketing : we 've got we 've got the speech recognition on it , have n't we . industrial designer : but not the kinetic . marketing : but not the kinetic . industrial designer : like the power . project manager : no . 'cause you ca n't afford that w we took that out too . industrial designer : no , we c ca yeah , we ca n't afford both . marketing : alright , so project manager : did n't you ? or marketing : so it does n't it 's pretty the prototype as it is is n't sort of um fulfilling the industrial designer : no may is maybe about neutral user interface : maybe a three . industrial designer : plus it it it 's got something , but it has n't got marketing : okay . yeah . project manager : well , wait a minute . in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . user interface : i would give it more than a four . project manager : the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . industrial designer : right . project manager : and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so , it 's very much dependant on what you do with your options . and if you 're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : right , okay . project manager : the other functions we 've got in are are more at the the special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that 's at the high end 'cause that 's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . now you 're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you 're going for the sample sensors speaker , you 're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay . project manager : and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , industrial designer : um project manager : and then you 're looking to uh take out uh point two , marketing : s i 'm just gon na check my email . project manager : which would be come from the button supplements category . marketing : i 'm just gon na check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . user interface : how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? because we did say that we do n't wan na follow the fashion too much . if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . project manager : um , interface type um , user interface : and then it stand the test of time better . project manager : well plastic rather than rubber . marketing : okay . but i project manager : that that that would make the significant difference . you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you 'd be looking to take out point two . so you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : and that would enable you to to do it . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . industrial designer : so it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . , i just read the email again and it sort of says it 's evaluate the design sort of as it is , i think , so i think we need to think about finance after we 've sort of evaluated that design . i do n't know whether we 're doing it in the wrong order or something or . project manager : well , okay , but user interface : well , i suppose it 's rubber as it is , is n't it . project manager : it 's rubber as it is , yes . marketing : so , i mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we 've got both the both the um the speech project manager : we got we 've we 've got thirteen point seven user interface : yeah . project manager : and we 've got it in at the moment and if and basically , we 're going to reduce down from that . marketing : yeah . project manager : but the current one , you 'd say would be fancy , would be too industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : yeah . um , for for innovation , so we 've got the speech the speech thing , and project manager : mm-hmm . i would 've said about a two as well . marketing : do you reckon a two ? user interface : yeah , two or three . i 'd be happy with a two . marketing : okay . two . and the next one is i 'll have to get it back up now . user interface : project manager : the next on well , i can just sing about . easy to use . i would 've said yes . i would go for a one on that at this point in time . user interface : yeah . yeah , marketing : okay . user interface : i would say so as well . project manager : um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . well , yeah it certainly has some . industrial designer : um project manager : . user interface : yeah , it 's got the cherry and the sponginess . industrial designer : it does , yeah . marketing : um say about a three maybe ? project manager : i do n't know . industrial designer : yeah , m um user interface : maybe two ? industrial designer : yeah , it was just doing it quite well . um , i think we 're gon na have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it 's um project manager : yeah , i woulda said two would seem reasonable . marketing : it 's a two . project manager : the product is a recognisable real r uh reaction product ? marketing : yeah , this is industrial designer : uh the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , marketing : this project manager : industrial designer : and it 's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . user interface : yeah , that 's a bit rough at the minute . marketing : yeah . so this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . industrial designer : okay . marketing : so sort of is it sort of a recognisable product . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . project manager : s user interface : marketing : user interface : uh , well it 's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine . marketing : what do y industrial designer : also it 's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um , it depends which way you look at it . marketing : uh-huh . project manager : okay . so we 're going for a two , marketing : so industrial designer : maybe a kind of three ? uh d project manager : three ? user interface : yeah , two or three . marketing : two or three ? user interface : well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . it 's just that the pen would n't really write on that paper . project manager : sure . industrial designer : user interface : but um , i think the logo would definitely be recognisable . marketing : yeah . user interface : and it does have attributes that other products do . two ? aye . go for it . project manager : right , okay . marketing : two or three . user interface : project manager : two . marketing : how project manager : right , come on . that 's that decided . marketing : two . okay . project manager : right . so marketing : right . project manager : so we 're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then marketing : yeah . user interface : what does what do all them numbers mean then ? do we add them up and rate or anything ? marketing : yeah we s yeah , i think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gon na be i 'm just gon na do this in my head . project manager : about a two . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : one point eight is n't it or something . i think , anyway . so yeah , pretty close to a two . industrial designer : yeah , so it 's marketing : so so it 's i mean it 's pretty good at the moment , but it 's gon na get worse , is n't it . but we 've got ta try and make sure it does n't get too bad . project manager : two b two b two , yeah . industrial designer : so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . marketing : industrial designer : okay , so we need to marketing : yeah . project manager : well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements . marketing : do you wan na plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances project manager : okay , well i put it back on . industrial designer : so i guess this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ? project manager : marketing : i 'm not sure . project manager : user interface : we 'll probably have to re-rate it . project manager : yes , i would 've thought so . industrial designer : yeah , yeah we 'll make the adjustments marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and then see how are rates are going . project manager : okay , so what was it , control uh f_ eight , was n't it ? user interface : ah it 's on . marketing : it 's come on already . project manager : oh . oh . how kind . user interface : project manager : right , okay . so , you can see there that the if you want to keep kinetic , right , you 've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . you 've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item . industrial designer : oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , project manager : that 's right . industrial designer : which gets us um in right within the budget range . project manager : which gets you user interface : yeah , i think that 'd be fine . because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway . industrial designer : so that 's eleven point seven , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements . project manager : alright . marketing : different different colours , yeah . yeah , i was i was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case . industrial designer : possibly , yeah . um user interface : yeah . project manager : okay , so industrial designer : and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . so we 'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of project manager : so we 're going for plastic , yes ? marketing : lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but industrial designer : oh yeah , and that would now be marketing : and then industrial designer : yeah , that 's that 's within the budget . um do we actually have do we just have one special uh special forms down here ? project manager : well , uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them . you got special colour . industrial designer : um project manager : well originally i was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour . industrial designer : and we we 've we 've got we 've got enough for another user interface : yeah , i think we should just imagine white buttons . industrial designer : we 've got nought point eight left , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so we 've got enough for another project manager : well , we 've got special form . now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special industrial designer : yeah , um project manager : so so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . industrial designer : but the but but but the project manager : the other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium . industrial designer : i think maybe the special colour , we 've got three now just because the volume buttons are different , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i guess we 'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . project manager : alright . so , special colour , you want three in there . industrial designer : yeah , which i think we should yeah , they 'll still be fine for the for the price . project manager : okay . marketing : well i thin i think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it 's just two supplements , you know . one original colour and then sort of two supplements , i think maybe . project manager : that makes sense . industrial designer : okay , uh that 's probably it . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay . so we only ne we only need two for that . project manager : okay . marketing : 'cause i mean these these are moulded . the one colour 's gon na be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber , is n't it . project manager : okay . yeah , i would agree with that , i think . and we 've got special form is the one apple . marketing : right . project manager : the rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be you were making these buttons down the bottom , i was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? was that the idea ? industrial designer : ne uh user interface : yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit . industrial designer : maybe that 'll be a second supplement . then there 's a spe a second special form . marketing : yeah , that project manager : uh-huh . i would have thought that 's probably about r well . industrial designer : um well you got you got twelve . user interface : marketing : okay , so tha industrial designer : so i think that should still be okay . yeah , that 's twelve point three , project manager : right . industrial designer : so we 're still within budget on that . um project manager : yep , that makes sense . industrial designer : so decide we 've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we 've kept the other attributes to the project manager : i woulda said so . yeah . so you 'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two . industrial designer : that 's without yeah . marketing : so shall we do a well , um industrial designer : and specially it definitely could fits the the real product what was the what 's the company name ? project manager : real reaction produ user interface : real reactions ? industrial designer : r yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : i 'm not quite sure , what does that mean ? marketing : yeah . user interface : industrial designer : i mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that 's like if that 's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on marketing : yeah , so uh project manager : yep i would s marketing : so it 's w if we 've if we 've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . like we got a cherry one . maybe other ones could be something else shaped . i do n't know . that would be poss seeing as seeing as it 's cheaper to make them a different seeing as we 've got , you know , we 've made it a a special form , so project manager : you mean of industrial designer : um marketing : and that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . and it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , project manager : well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : i do n't know . project manager : because at the moment you 're making a red apple . so next year you could make next year 's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . industrial designer : yeah so it 's a marketing : well you could yeah . industrial designer : whatever fruit was in fashion next year . marketing : project manager : yeah , l a lemon lemon or something . marketing : yeah , i mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe . project manager : and that industrial designer : project manager : amount marketing : okay . so , we 've what have we what have we rid of . we got rid of the plastic . project manager : yeah , we 've the main thing we 've changed really is the casing is n't it ? marketing : is it industrial designer : that yeah , that was uh marketing : the rubber . industrial designer : that was just about all . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think we 've saved quite a bit because we 've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um so maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we 've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ? marketing : but uh industrial designer : i dunno . and that is like the most standard type of button . marketing : so i mean , we 've got we got rid of the rubber case , but we 've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . so maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we 're pretty much the same , maybe . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so , i mean we could maybe put two again on them . industrial designer : and everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so project manager : well , ease has certainly stayed . industrial designer : yeah , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . and what about the sort of innovation ? industrial designer : um , well we 've still got the kinetic energy . um marketing : do you think okay . project manager : and the speech feature . industrial designer : yeah , the speech feature . marketing : and then , the corporate identity . industrial designer : i think we 've cut just about the same . we 've maybe lost has n't it it 's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect project manager : how it would play out , yeah . oh . marketing : yeah . whether whether that 's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , i do n't know . industrial designer : um marketing : i mean , it 's maybe not . i mean industrial designer : but i think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but marketing : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : but either way , i think we 've made it fairly close to what marketing : yeah . okay , well i mean user interface : yeah , i do n't see how we could make it any more . um , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing . marketing : we cou mm-hmm . user interface : but then what colour would you make the r_s ? industrial designer : just the the company logo . so maybe there 's like a set design which we get printed off . marketing : yeah . project manager : well , but you 've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . so you 're in a sense , you 're comparing the product without the company logo . industrial designer : okay . project manager : and then y but you 've got the space for it to stick it on . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : hey , what what what 's the company colour ? did you get told what the company colour is or industrial designer : i 'm still not quite sure we 've established that . project manager : do n't think so . user interface : i just project manager : but but i but in the sense that , as you saw with um the windows logo badge , it does n't really matter . user interface : we got the logo off the web browser . marketing : oh right . user interface : project manager : there 's virtually n the way that you frame , you know , the windows badge on there , it really does n't matter what colour it is , so long as our company 's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : fact , they 've got black and white or black and silver . so basically , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you 've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . marketing : mm . project manager : and that 's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it . marketing : okay . uh-huh . 'cause you 've got sort of we 've got point two to play with if you really wanted to . project manager : you could put in another marketing : another colour . project manager : well , in this one , you 've actually got three colours of buttons . marketing : or would that be t project manager : well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . marketing : yeah . okay . project manager : so you were talking about uh um we 're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : which m may or may not be the case . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um marketing : shall we save the point two for profitability then ? project manager : well , yeah . bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ? user interface : um , i do n't think they would really need to be . i think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it 'd be fine . industrial designer : yeah , maybe we 've m user interface : needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well . industrial designer : maybe for the the one they 're gon na see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want . and then for the more functional buttons , we do n't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it 's hidden away anyway , you 're not gon na see it at the start . marketing : yeah . i mean it 's the sort of thing that , i mean , you wan na pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . project manager : yeah , well marketing : so , if it 's dead obvious , then that 's fine . but if you 're opening the panel and you 're looking and you 're tuning , then you 're paying a bit more attention . so it may be sort of different colour buttons is n't so important . project manager : alright . okay . marketing : 'cause you yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so project manager : so we just add that to profitability in effect . marketing : yeah , i mean so we 've dropped the cost , but user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : right , so we 're meant to finish up in five minutes . marketing : same sort of function ? the criteria ? it 's alright . industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : just made a load of money . user interface : should n't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? 'cause we 've lost the overall spongy feel . 'cause it does n't seem right that it just has n't changed at all . project manager : marketing : well , but i think we said that w because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons . industrial designer : project manager : user interface : alright . marketing : le lemon sh user interface : did we decide what that was , which button it was ? on the volume ones ? marketing : i think well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . user interface : right . project manager : industrial designer : uh , . that 's good . marketing : or something like that . yeah . project manager : industrial designer : definitely lemon shaped . marketing : industrial designer : marketing : did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? or was it the other way around ? industrial designer : you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so i think we can we 're okay . marketing : right , okay . project manager : so we 're okay this way around . marketing : yeah . so that project manager : until the design team comes in and says , get off . marketing : so we 've saved project manager : but you are the design team . industrial designer : then we say it 's fine , so it 's all good . marketing : saved two euros on that . project manager : so what bit are we on to ? user interface : um , can i just check if that 's a cherry or an apple ? did we decide against the apple because of apple mac ? and did we make it a cherry officially ? project manager : yeah . i th i th marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : oh . right , okay . industrial designer : just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like . user interface : project manager : marketing : project manager : oh drats , i 've botched that , have n't i . user interface : so were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ? marketing : well , we 're aiming for um one for all of them . user interface : right . marketing : m but it really has to fit into the budget , so i guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the which is fair enough . industrial designer : and we seem to have least something in each criteria . we have n't completely left anything out , so marketing : yeah . yeah , i think industrial designer : as an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we 've just about achieved everything . marketing : most yeah . yep . user interface : so do we have anything else to discuss ? marketing : i do n't know . what 's on the agenda ? project manager : right , okay um what 's happened here ? right , okay um mm . right , okay um , right . so we got so we 've done the the finance bit and the excel project and the we 've done the redesign . industrial designer : we 've got the closing . project manager : so we 're now on to project process . now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . so , we 're actually now uh , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . industrial designer : marketing : uh-huh . project manager : so what did you and remembering that nobody 's just over the curtain . marketing : project manager : so , um marketing : finish your meeting now . industrial designer : we should just go through this quickly and then project manager : so marketing : yeah . project manager : i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which i will do . marketing : okay . project manager : so , uh i think i have to finish that page . right , okay , so marketing : oh . project manager : project evaluation . so , um creativity . did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough ? marketing : industrial designer : um , yeah . yeah . project manager : well um user interface : yeah . marketing : i thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary . project manager : individual meetings . how do you mean ? marketing : yeah . well , we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings , project manager : in you on your own . marketing : and they did n't the one meeting did n't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you 'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you 'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , project manager : um marketing : and i do n't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you 'd do that . you know , you 'd sort of you 'd probably present it at one or something like that . project manager : mm , the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . marketing : yeah . project manager : then you go away . you find out information . you then come back . you then discuss it . you then go and change things around , marketing : uh-huh . project manager : and then go back . so industrial designer : yeah , i suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time marketing : yeah . project manager : whereas , this time , you 're really getting it from a database source , industrial designer : and then diff things will be relevant . marketing : yeah . project manager : so it 's not uh well uh marketing : yeah . project manager : anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? user interface : marketing : project manager : i 've put , seemed okay . creativity , seemed okay . um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed . marketing : yeah . user interface : i think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . i mean a remote control is n't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . marketing : yeah , the thing itself . project manager : um user interface : i ca n't think of a better example at the minute . marketing : yeah . project manager : have could have used a different example pel to increase create creativity . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on . project manager : you have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . i mean it depends what sort of business you 're in , i guess . i mean this one seems . from the website it looks it 's quite innovative , but we 're coming up with some bucket shop product are n't we user interface : marketing : that 's , you know , fifteen quid . industrial designer : one of those things . like uh , companies can have like a range of products and project manager : i th i uh d industrial designer : i do n't know how it works but i guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of project manager : but the other thing is that uh they 're i 'm guessing that they 're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . i mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer marketing : yeah . project manager : um for um you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so what she 's doing is she 's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . and then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person 's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see joe bloggs , or whatever . so uh , and that was a project i suspect similar to this , because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work . and of course , you had the machine crashing industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and various things going wrong . so industrial designer : well , sh we look at the last slide , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : see if it 's got anything else . project manager : alright , industrial designer : i think there 's one one more to go . project manager : so we 've got uh marketing : yeah . i mean if you look at their products on their website here , real reaction , i mean it 's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . project manager : new ideas found , marketing : and project manager : did we find any , no . industrial designer : it was quite good with this um the white board , having that and the digital pens . project manager : alright . industrial designer : like , that 's something that made it a little easier . marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : leadership , teamwork . marketing : we did find a new idea , i mean sort of a kinetic remote control . i 've never seen one of them before . batteries , i think . so project manager : does industrial designer : voice recognition , especially not could project manager : you 've got voice recognition computers , marketing : mm yeah . project manager : that 's not remote controls . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : well it 's a different application of it . project manager : mm-hmm . okay , industrial designer : yeah , so it 's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . project manager : so how do you reckon teamwork went ? industrial designer : um marketing : that went okay , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , i guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm , yeah . project manager : to uh go uh reasonably well . okay . marketing : i do n't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything project manager : bit bit arbitrary . marketing : well , i mean i do n't think it i just do n't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . i mean , they 've got all these sort of , you know , high definition d_v_d_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and uh i 'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control does n't really fit in . project manager : so , we 're m we 're meant to comment on leadership and the means , e_ g_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . user interface : marketing : surely they they should produ project manager : and and new i new ideas found was the the other thing . user interface : well leadership 's a bit of a funny one , is n't it . marketing : yeah . user interface : but we ca n't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager . project manager : user interface : you were the leader . so our experience of leadership was n't really as much as yours . marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : now , i 'd much rather be in marketing user interface : marketing : project manager : but i certainly did n't get this uh computer to work as well as i would have liked . marketing : project manager : however , um alright uh means , so whiteboard um so really , it 's uh equipment . oh . marketing : yeah . it worked . user interface : yeah , very nice . marketing : comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but user interface : but i mean , i d i do n't i 'm not sure i see the value in these . i mean , they record what you 're writing , and then what do you do with it ? where do you get the recording ? do you plug the computer or something ? marketing : i think there 's a little there 's a little um chi industrial designer : so it 's not just for us , it 's for the experiment as a whole , so marketing : there 's a little there 's a little chip , i think you must plug it into something industrial designer : should we quickly look at the last slide ? marketing : and it produces a industrial designer : sh user interface : right . i think you watch a video of it kind of . marketing : i do n't know . whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you 've written or something , and page after page . project manager : right . new ideas found , so one or two . marketing : yeah . kinetic powered remote control . um , what was the other one ? user interface : voice um recognition thing . marketing : vo yeah . project manager : um and uh voice marketing : project manager : uh , was it voice activated um marketing : voice recognition , yeah . s project manager : recognition . marketing : almost . user interface : pretty much . marketing : to fill in these fill in these questionnaires project manager : right , so , uh are the costs within budget , marketing : oh no . project manager : yes . is the project evaluated , yes . uh , do n't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . then celebration . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : . is that everything ? marketing : hmm ? i think that we 've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting ."
