    "answer": "postdoc a : and i have uh so my my feeling on it is that i think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . on the other hand , i the down side for me was that i think the pen is really noisy . so you have ka kaplunk , kaplunk , kaplunk . and i and i do n't know if it 's audible on the but i i sort of thought that was a disadvantage . i do take notes , i mean , i could be taking notes on these things and i guess the plus with the crosspads would be the time markings but i do n't know . phd d : uh , what is a crosspad ? professor b : so it 's it 's um it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . grad c : thank you . professor b : and so you have time and position stuff stored so that you can you have a record of whatever it is you 've written . grad h : and then you can download it and they have ocr and searching and all sorts of things . phd d : ok . ok . grad h : so i if you take notes it 's a great little device . postdoc a : could mm - hmm . grad h : but i do n't take notes , professor b : and one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in in higher - level things , not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? and um i think that was one of the things , phd d : yeah . phd g : yeah . professor b : right ? and so the it seemed like a neat idea . we 'll have a you know , have a scribe , have somebody uh take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . and then we did it once or twice and we sort of grad h : yep , and then just sort of died out . professor b : probably chose the wrong scribe but it was it 's uh phd g : i mean grad h : yeah that 's right . postdoc a : well i did it one time but um professor b : yeah . postdoc a : u but i guess the the other thing i 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing i wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and taking notes in some other interface . phd f : i mean we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ? postdoc a : oh it 's la it 's useful , grad h : because that 's summary . postdoc a : have a summary and high points ."
