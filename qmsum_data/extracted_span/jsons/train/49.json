    "answer": "project manager : shall we move rapidly on to uh kendra ? industrial designer : okay . user interface : okay . project manager : uh um ra rapidly move the cable over . user interface : let 's see . project manager : mm . oh good . user interface : oh . yes . is it gon na work ? project manager : mm yeah , industrial designer : yeah , it 's thinking about it . project manager : it 'll get there . yep . user interface : okay . okay , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so i did some research on the internet and um what you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , um commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there 're just kind of a variety of choices . um findings , so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . project manager : mm , yeah . user interface : there 're some special ones available , like this one right here , project manager : uh-huh . user interface : which is marketed towards children , um different designs , project manager : alright . user interface : and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a v_ in volume because people some bring a little picture of what i thought ours could look like . industrial designer : user interface : so just kind of minimise the clutter , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . project manager : mm yeah . sorry y y yeah , if i can interrupt you . well d p 'kay , do you wan na say anything about um slide controls ? i mean i think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they 're they 're si simple , cheap and reliable . industrial designer : uh uh i think they 're they 're about the same cost really . i i mean , i think it 's just sort of the the there 's a lot of slide buttons out there . i think it 's pretty much the same sort of connection . mm yeah . project manager : okay , fair enough , fine . user interface : just because i n for example if i 'm using a mouse i like to be able to slide it up and down so i thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down project manager : yeah . good , good . user interface : and then the project manager : yeah . user interface : this is my great little drawing . project manager : so three three there 's three buttons on a slider . industrial designer : project manager : three buttons , channel up channel up down and user interface : y yes , yes . marketing : well , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what i mean , up like one unit , if you see what i mean . user interface : yeah . marketing : so it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it 's like like like like a cog or something . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : so you kinda take it up one at a time . project manager : okay . um user interface : the only advantage i was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you 're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it 's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : oh . project manager : this one on the one side and one marketing : uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could project manager : yeah . okay . industrial designer : ye yeah , 'cause i 've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so it 'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . you 'd know what you were fiddling with . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : or yeah uh th th the i mean thi this is what the user interface : that was marketing : yeah , like the shape of it almost like a mouse , with a project manager : we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it 's going to do . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay , so we we 're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change user interface : um well project manager : of one sort . user interface : i was thinking kind of just for the volume , project manager : just for the volume , uh . user interface : but what what do you guys think ? marketing : dep i dunno if it user interface : we could marketing : depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , i dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , user interface : yeah , yeah . marketing : and then you could control the buttons with your fingers . project manager : fingers , industrial designer : yeah , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : 'cause if yeah , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , project manager : it yeah , i mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , industrial designer : just the way it would user interface : yeah . industrial designer : mm yeah , yeah , yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : um that there 's no no possibility of uh confusing the two . marketing : oh yeah , yeah . project manager : so okay . right so uh user interface : i 'm just gon na pass this along . project manager : that 's sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo okay , fine . industrial designer : user interface : yeah . marketing : project manager : mm right . industrial designer : well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . i mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness project manager : uh marketing : yeah , industrial designer : and and sc marketing : that 's a good idea . industrial designer : and then you can you can minimise the buttons user interface : yeah , i suppose i sup industrial designer : and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : if we we 're i mean i 'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . user interface : so i guess we could have a menu button as well . industrial designer : yeah user interface : we could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume . project manager : uh uh uh marketing : project manager : okay , if we if we 're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . do we need some sort of display ? industrial designer : but the television would be the display project manager : we actually use the television , okay . okay , okay , okay . user interface : yeah , that 's on the tv , yeah . industrial designer : that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu user interface : yeah , and then y industrial designer : and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you 'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah . marketing : well i mean on a onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , that 's true . user interface : yeah , press that is t industrial designer : i never understood how that worked though , user interface : yeah , that might work . project manager : industrial designer : but yeah . user interface : yeah , it 's like um yeah , it 's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . you just press it . industrial designer : yeah , mm . user interface : yeah , and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . industrial designer : mm , oka yeah . yeah . user interface : you know what i mean ?"
