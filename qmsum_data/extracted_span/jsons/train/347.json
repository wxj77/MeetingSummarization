    "answer": "project manager : okay . uh first of all i 'll start with the costs , marketing : . project manager : because that 's going to influence our design . user interface : oh no . marketing : oh , . project manager : if you do n't know if you al already had a look or not ? user interface : no n i i already did it . industrial designer : did you do your questionnaire already ? user interface : it 's not much . it 's just one question . project manager : because we have a problem . industrial designer : uh marketing : oh . project manager : if you look closely , you can see . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : it wants project manager : um i already took the liberty to make some suggestions . . . at the moment we have fifteen buttons , one lcd screen , one advanced chip-on-print . we use a uh sensor , that 's for the speech . uh we use kinetic energy . and we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour . okay . what 's the first thing we should drop ? the special colour of the buttons ? user interface : no that 's that 's for the trendy uh feel and look . so project manager : okay . uh industrial designer : yeah but everything is . project manager : should we switch to a hand dynamo ? user interface : project manager : uh that 's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . user interface : yeah , b but marketing : yeah but young people like that . project manager : batteries ? marketing : so just do normal battery . project manager : batteries . user interface : i think the battery option . industrial designer : just a normal battery then , yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : . marketing : it has to be twelve and a half . project manager : yeah . marketing : or not ? user interface : oh . project manager : so industrial designer : oh my goodness . project manager : you 're going to redesign something . marketing : user interface : oh no . project manager : okay , so we 're at twenty five . marketing : uh , yeah . project manager : um do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? industrial designer : well i guess i we 'll have to go for single curve then . i mean we have to drop on everything . project manager : mm-hmm . uh marketing : but we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it 's it 's flat , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and the screen screen is just well you just have to hold it like this then . so project manager : yeah . um industrial designer : how about sorry . project manager : uh another option i saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you ca n't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . that would skip nine buttons and four and a half euros . industrial designer : that 's what i was thinking . user interface : yeah . marketing : alright . project manager : yeah ? marketing : let 's do it then . yeah . project manager : uh then we have left user interface : but we do n't have any basic options any more . marketing : we project manager : uh yeah . we do . industrial designer : and uh 'cause then they do n't have to n they do n't need special colour as well . marketing : f_ eight . project manager : they do n't need special colours . fine . that 's more like it . marketing : yeah . user interface : project manager : you were saying something . industrial designer : that was exactly my point . like let 's drop all the buttons , and just make one project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i mean we 're gon na use the lcd screen anyway . so we 'll just have to use it for everything . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah . industrial designer : and then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click project manager : yeah , some more menu options . yeah . okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . industrial designer : project manager : but um now let 's look . user interface : yeah we c could we only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . everything you can do with with the menu . so with the display . industrial designer : project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah we need one integrated button for everything then . user interface : yeah . marketing : the joystick . project manager : uh industrial designer : yeah . kind of . i was because marketing : project manager : yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh industrial designer : yeah . if you if you go to marketing : integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah . industrial designer : if you go to our uh view , like you if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wan na adjust the treble for instance , project manager : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : this is just uh an example , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : y y you wan na see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example . project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : but you want a sound preview of how it 's gon na sound , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : right ? so you wan na click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so you 'll you 'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button . marketing : yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so that 's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you 're out of it . industrial designer : exactly . marketing : but you still but you then still need to have well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . but you still um industrial designer : yeah it 's r yeah . marketing : you still have to have some some button in the menu to go back . user interface : so you do one inte you can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . marketing : yeah . user interface : and then just drop all the other buttons . project manager : uh yeah . marketing : well not all . user interface : but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . marketing : not s not sound i guess . industrial designer : no . project manager : yeah . it 's uh one integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button . marketing : user interface : yeah . project manager : so user interface : so we have to to make it s uh more uh it has to be project manager : you could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . you just drop the okay and the back . marketing : yeah . wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ? project manager : oh , that 's for the speech . marketing : speech recognition . project manager : yeah . user interface : could drop the speech recognition . marketing : right . project manager : s s drop speech recognition ? industrial designer : no but project manager : yeah that 's possible . user interface : we we d industrial designer : yeah it 's it 's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 'cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons . project manager : buttons . marketing : buttons . project manager : that 's not very easy to use . user interface : yeah . marketing : no , it can be disturbed by by noise and project manager : industrial designer : yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works . marketing : stuff like that . let let let me see what 's more what 's more popular . i guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . user interface : yeah . marketing : i have to look on that . let me see . uh well no i was wrong . project manager : marketing : there are more people who like speech recognition than an lcd screen . project manager : yep . okay . because if you d lose the lcd screen , we need a lot of marketing : but if it but it it it 's a it 's a both a hypers user interface : we lose our whole concept . project manager : yeah . user interface : uh so no we just project manager : we need a lot of extra buttons . marketing : no , but user interface : we keep the lcd . marketing : well we yeah we keep the screen . i mean it 's it 's about the same . eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six . industrial designer : we uh we we have n't really integrated this the speech into the system , project manager : so we drop the speech . industrial designer : so we can might as well s drop that . project manager : and drop it yeah ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . let 's drop the speech . project manager : okay . s fo four less euros . so we still have three and a half euro to lose . user interface : marketing : sixteen euros . industrial designer : we need to lose some buttons . marketing : but y y project manager : yeah if you lose the the back , the okay button uh v let 's say we only have the four arrows , and the menu button . marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : then you 're marketing : and then and then use um project manager : oh and the power button we have also . marketing : the the okay . and the menu button does also does the okay function then . project manager : yeah . marketing : and then when you in the menu project manager : so that 's one euro . marketing : s so so you activate the menu . user interface : if we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons . project manager : yeah . yeah ? and user interface : with with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . with the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera . marketing : yeah yeah . yeah . . project manager : that would save zero point two euros compared to no . user interface : no it 's three euros . no ? um project manager : yeah . to this together is more expensive than oof , it 's almost the same as t keeping this . user interface : no it 's it 's n yeah . yeah yeah yeah . project manager : and we can drop these two . marketing : well okay . user interface : it 's the marketing : for example if you have f f four buttons , channel up and down , uh volume left right project manager : volume . marketing : okay , i 've i think we have to keep that . project manager : and the power button . marketing : and then and the power button . so that 's five . project manager : that 's the basic . marketing : that 's basic . that that 's what you need anyway . and then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu . or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . and then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . click again , it 's okay . then you only need one button to move back . or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . and in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . user interface : marketing : so that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . project manager : yep . okay th that 's marketing : but we ca n't drop three buttons . industrial designer : which that 's even marketing : but i see that 's project manager : yeah that 's one euro more expensive . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : so that 's not a good idea . project manager : that 's not an option . marketing : because which buttons do we have now ? those five which i mentioned , and then menu , and then project manager : menu , power . marketing : yeah . f of the four things ? project manager : four arrows ? marketing : yeah , th power . project manager : power . uh industrial designer : yeah , if you if you go to eight marketing : which more ? industrial designer : i do n't know how to project manager : yeah . okay . so four arrows ? marketing : yeah . project manager : uh power i believe ? marketing : power . th yeah that 's five . project manager : uh we have a back and a okay button . marketing : yeah , okay that 's seven , project manager : and the menu . marketing : and one to activate the menu , yeah . so okay that 's eight . well we ca n't reduce that . we we keep the display . project manager : yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . so marketing : oh , well okay . yeah . project manager : industrial designer : yeah , we need the chip for the for the l_c_ display . marketing : project manager : the lcd ? yeah . user interface : let 's make the let 's make the case plastic . marketing : yeah well we need the advanced project manager : then i rather make it wood . marketing : instead of r project manager : because then also it 's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . true . marketing : yeah but but that 's not our market . user interface : but project manager : no that maybe not . but maybe it 's better than plastic anyway . marketing : ah no , hard plastic . user interface : plastic with a with a special colour . industrial designer : oh . user interface : a woo wood uh wood uh wood colour . marketing : yeah , plastic with special colour . project manager : yeah ? marketing : no but i i project manager : yeah okay uh user interface : that 's an option . marketing : because we have to use the special colour anyway . you forgot that . user interface : yeah . project manager : yep . yeah , yeah . user interface : so we do one one s marketing : so let 's go for the plastic . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , okay . plastic . marketing : and since it 's not kinetic , it does n't have to flip around that much ? project manager : uh that 's easy because plastic is free . marketing : we still have problem of two euros . project manager : yeah , okay . uh if we dropped uh marketing : user interface : no the buttons , those are really needed . project manager : yeah ? user interface : yeah th th it 's it 's uh marketing : yeah we ca n't drop them . user interface : an advanced chip-on-print . project manager : you still need that . industrial designer : yeah uh marketing : do we really need that advanced chip for an lcd display ? industrial designer : you uh uh yeah . so the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and which can use a regular chip , wh which is six euros in total . project manager : s industrial designer : that does n't matter . marketing : oh . i rather keep i rather keep the display . project manager : no , i keep the re yeah . yeah . because we already designed for it . so industrial designer : well yeah . marketing : so the only option is an hand dynamo . industrial designer : exactly . user interface : oh that project manager : yeah and something else . industrial designer : yeah but the marketing : oh no tha oh that 's one euro , right . industrial designer : uh ca n't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'cause that will save us one and a half euro already . and then if w marketing : and then integrated s yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . project manager : no y you would rec marketing : i mean it 's not that important , easy to use , but project manager : then you have industrial designer : th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? project manager : then you still need two additional buttons i believe . industrial designer : and uh marketing : yeah . project manager : for the volume . industrial designer : yeah d at l yeah . at least one for power . project manager : you can use those yeah . user interface : but the project manager : oh yeah and power . that 's three buttons and this would cost industrial designer : oh . yeah it 's just as expensive as what we have now . user interface : but the integrated uh button ? how many func functions can it uh have ? project manager : yeah . three . up , down , okay . industrial designer : yeah endlessly . i mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . user interface : okay . industrial designer : you can go into you in you main menu , marketing : you you press it for like three seconds . industrial designer : you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options . marketing : then then then you should do everything in the menu . on the screen . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah , okay . it would save enough industrial designer : maybe we should . 'cause we do n't have money and w we want the screen . project manager : yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half euro left . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we can maybe still use power button . marketing : yeah , but we 'd alright . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i guess we have to . marketing : it s it saves us four euros and it costs us two and a half . so let 's see , we we drop the price by one and a half . project manager : yeah . you see ? industrial designer : we 'll we 'll be on marketing : but we still have thirteen left . project manager : oh still yeah ? oh then i miscalculated . oh yeah . marketing : thirteen . so still half . project manager : shit . drop the special colour . marketing : there goes the special co user interface : oh no . marketing : well that would make it less appealing . so that 's no option . project manager : 'kay . what else ? uncurved ? user interface : no no , it has to be um curved . marketing : we sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah it says right here . project manager : they made it very easy for us . user interface : okay . marketing : well yeah . yeah . we made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it 's a cool feature . project manager : ah , i do n't think i can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than marketing : user interface : okay . wh what we could do is um drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : buttons . that 's oh yeah since we only have one button . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : yeah but i mean what is meant by special colour ? project manager : i just m i do n't i think user interface : just something else than than black or white i think . project manager : uh yeah it 's i think it 's grey , regular . marketing : s yeah . alright . project manager : grey and rubber . industrial designer : but we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . project manager : of plastic . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : damn . marketing : so i rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : yeah and then project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah yeah . marketing : you can still play with it then i guess . i do n't know . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . so i guess that is n't an option . user interface : the display industrial designer : well , you only have to power it up when you wan na use it . marketing : yeah . user interface : the but if you have to power the for ten minutes , then the marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i do n't know . marketing : yeah . project manager : no i do n't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no . industrial designer : . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah true . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : let 's let 's go for the hand dynamo then . project manager : yeah hand dynamo ? do you want an extra button ? marketing : or or do we or do we do uncurved and flat ? instead of project manager : user interface : no no it has to be curved . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . user interface : yeah . just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and a screen . industrial designer : yeah . that 's the most import project manager : yep ? instead of an additional power button ? user interface : yeah or spe special form ? marketing : yeah . s what what is special f oh yeah , special form . project manager : yeah ? marketing : maybe that 's nicer . project manager : it 's for scroll user interface : yeah . project manager : without marketing : but we do n't have any buttons . industrial designer : we only have marketing : so do user interface : yeah . but it 's it 's for the integrated button , i think also . or marketing : d uh make it a special colour then . industrial designer : yeah but marketing : yeah ma make it a special colour then . project manager : yeah but it 's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . so user interface : yeah . okay . yeah . marketing : okay . make it a special colour and then it look fancy . project manager : yeah ? so woah we 're within budget . marketing : so yeah . project manager : it 's a miracle . user interface : oh just marketing : let 's let 's save it . user interface : oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . marketing : yeah . user interface : okay . marketing : let 's do it like this , i mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we project manager : yeah ? okay . um , well . 'kay , this was old . industrial designer : well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ? user interface : yeah . okay . marketing : yeah all your designs are uh pretty much project manager : yeah back to work . uh industrial designer : project manager : did i save it ? industrial designer : it 's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah but that but that 's the fun part of it . project manager : i i wanted to go , but i was n't allowed . so industrial designer : oh yeah ? okay . marketing : alright ."
