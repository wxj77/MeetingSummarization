    "answer": "mr. larry maguire ( brandonsouris , cpc ) : mr . chair , farmers have contacted my office about the massive delays with processing the advance payment program loans . some put their applications in almost two months ago , and not a dollar has flowed . what 's the point of having an advance payment program if there 's no payment ? can the minister of agriculture tell us when these delays will end ? the chair : the honourable minister . hon . marie-claude bibeau ( minister of agriculture and agri-food ) : mr.chair , i can assure you that we are working with all the independent operators . this program is not administered by their officials , but by partners . i can assure you that , under the circumstances , they are doing their best to make the advance payments mr. larry maguire : farmers understand that some of the delays were caused by staff having to work remotely . however , did the minister approve a policy change on april 1 that made the eligibility for these loans more difficult during the middle of a pandemic , yes or no ? hon . marie-claude bibeau : mr.chair , a number of changes and improvements have been made to the program . to make things easier for our administrators , we have postponed some of the changes that could have been problematic . mr. larry maguire : yes , so some of the changes made it more problematic for the producers . the minister must take responsibility for these delays . farmers deserve an answer on why she changed the program . who advised her that it would be a good idea to make it more difficult for the farmers to access the advance payment program in the middle of a pandemic ? or did she just go ahead and do this on her own ? hon . marie-claude bibeau : mr.chair , we are constantly working with the administrators of the program . we are fully prepared to respond to their requests so that the advance payments program can best serve our producers across the country . mr. larry maguire : livestock producers are telling me that the premiums for the western livestock insurance program are too high . i told the minister of agriculture over two weeks ago that this was a problem , and yet she went out and said that farmers needed to make better use of existing support . when will the minister of agriculture listen to what the farmers are saying so they can actually use the existing programs ? hon . marie-claude bibeau : mr.chair , i would like to remind everyone that we have put in place certain measures to improve access to agristability . we have also significantly improved the agrirecovery program . over the past few years , this program amounted to about $ 15million . it is now $ 100million for pork and beef producers alone , not counting the $ 77.5million for food processors . mr. larry maguire : livestock producers in my riding and several across canada are still waiting for the minister of agriculture 's promise for an agrirecovery program . when will the minister of agriculture stop rubbing salt in the farmers ' wounds and provide the rest of the story she has been saying is on its way for over a month now in her agrirecovery promise ? hon . marie-claude bibeau : mr.chair , we have committed $ 50million to beef producers and $ 50million to pork producers through the agrirecovery program . here is how the program works : the federal government contributes up to60 % and then the provinces implement it how they see fit . mr. larry maguire : the funding announced by the minister of agriculture for the livestock industry was insufficient , and what was promised has not been delivered . this has caused hogs to be euthanized and over 100,000 feeder cattle to become overweight . the industry is in a crisis . how many livestock producers need to go bankrupt before they get the help they deserve ? hon . marie-claude bibeau : mr.chair , once again , we have significantly increased the amounts available through agrirecovery . it is $ 50million for beef producers and $ 50million for pork producers . these programs are administered by the provinces . there is also $ 77.5million for processors ."
