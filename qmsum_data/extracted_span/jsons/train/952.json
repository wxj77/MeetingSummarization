    "answer": "dawn bowden am : thank you . we had some evidence from the university and college union that were concerned about the governance of universities , actually , as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways . can you tell us , perhaps , how the he act addresses the issue of poor governance , or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself ? kirsty williams am : well , i think it 's true and fair to say that the bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector . hefcw do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation . but governance\u2014we 've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that i think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again , and i think there are two important things that we 're trying to do about that in the current time , prior to any legislative changes . the first is , as i just said to hefin , i have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them , not in the presence of their vice-chancellors . i challenge them , they challenge me , and i think we 've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since i took office . and you 'll be aware that , collaboratively\u2014and i 'm glad that this has been done in this way because i think if you do it this way , we 're more likely to get some success and change\u2014universities wales and hefcw have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance . and i think it 's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action , because i think if we 'd have tried to impose something , we 'd have more resistance . so , there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am : is that the risk review process in\u2014 ? kirsty williams am : that 's the gillian camm review . this is a review that , as i said , universities wales and hefcw have agreed to do together . it 's chaired by gillian camm , who is the chair of the leadership foundation for higher education , and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance . and i welcome that , i 'm very supportive of that , and that 's happening at the moment . as i said , i 'm glad that there 's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure , and they need to give confidence , that governance arrangements are what they should be . dawn bowden am : so , is that something that you 're going to be taking into the pcet bill , do you think ? kirsty williams am : yes , absolutely . we 're exploring how the bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance , and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance . i think one of the concerns for me\u2014and i know that this is a concern that is shared by the ucu\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions . hefcw do n't hold figures on it , but from an approximation that i 've asked officials to do for me , currently in the universities that we have , i would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities ' governing bodies ; women\u201444 per cent ; bme\u2014as low as 4 per cent . of course , in individual institutions , it does vary , but i think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there 's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward , the staff voice in governance going forward , and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward . dawn bowden am : but also , i guess\u2014sorry , chair\u2014a greater understanding , that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them . do you think that that 's a gap that needs to be plugged ?"
