    "query": "<s> summarize the presentation about the customer 's functional requirements of the remote and the team 's discussion about it .",
    "answer": "marketing : right , we 've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . and first off we should state that th the remote control 's for controlling the tv and um how do people use it ? we asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . and we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we 'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control and that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they were n't used very often at all . people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . and young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people were n't quite so keen on speech recognition . there 's a lot more th there 's a lot lot more older people who did n't know whether they wanted it or not as well . um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they could n't find it . and the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . okay , so my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech a design which looks high-tech , basically . um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as louisa said . um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an lcd menu for other functions on the remote control . that 's worth thinking about . um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gon na buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . that that might be the market that we 're we 're looking for . and we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it 's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels . 'cause there 's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . okay um , and that 's the end of the slide show . that 's it . cool . project manager : what was that last wee bit there ? user interface : do a lot of um marketing : um about speech recognition ? project manager : speech recognition , user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : but that was only for young people that preferred it , older people did n't . marketing : youn young people pref yeah , they s they said that they 'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so . industrial designer : no what i maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . um . project manager : well that 's right . marketing : yeah . yeah . yeah . industrial designer : and possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have you know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . so you can press a button which is always kept in one place marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . marketing : uh-huh . yeah . yeah , we 'd have t that would mean we 'd have to put two products together as well , industrial designer : that is true , yes . marketing : which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but user interface : there 's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , i ca n't remember , and then they whistle back , or something like that . marketing : yeah . project manager : sounds reasonable . user interface : that 'd probably be really simple , marketing : yeah . user interface : they 're cheap . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . so industrial designer : so i guess it 'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . project manager : well if you 're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here i am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . but if you i know . um i was gon na say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever . you 'd want to try and av just have the one product that if industrial designer : yeah . yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . project manager : yeah . um i dunno um talking about vo i mean obviously if you 've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it 'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : but you 've then got the point if if you 're not going with uh voice recognition then industrial designer : you could have an option to turn it off . or marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : perhaps , um . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so that would solve the problems with the tv kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . marketing : project manager : so uh any sugges well , any conclusions ? marketing : um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? user interface : project manager : well if it does then we ca n't . marketing : considering project manager : it 's that simple , marketing : yeah . project manager : because we 've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had the design logo was one , which we 've already mentioned . we 've got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet . so that means that uh industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : okay . project manager : so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so we 're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . so anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick industrial designer : has to be simple enough to project manager : because time to market is is critical . s industrial designer : i suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . um . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : it would . but probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras . industrial designer : 'kay . project manager : added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so and if and we 've got ta get to the end . uh d d i think i think first and foremost we 've got ta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay ."
