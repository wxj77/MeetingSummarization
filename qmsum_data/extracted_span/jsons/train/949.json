    "answer": "huw morris : in the hazelkorn review , there 's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they 're doing . and potentially , in some of these other institutions , funding is linked to some of those things . kirsty williams am : and , of course , what always has to be\u2014 . what we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution . so , there 's that balance to be struck , is n't there , about creating a regulatory regime , which i 'm very keen and the act attempted to do , which was to enshrine institutional autonomy , and that 's really , really important , but also a regulatory regime , the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector , which you know , better than probably anybody else in this room , guards that institutional autonomy very , very , very dear indeed . and that 's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you . dawn . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . i think , in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and i understand what you 're saying\u2014but i think what hefcw were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with . the post-16 sector , however many we 're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it 's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions . so , the informal measures might not be as prevalent as they are currently , possibly . kirsty williams am : yes , but also , what 's incumbent upon me as the minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector , because what 's really important to remember is that hefcw will be replaced . we 're not asking hefcw suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50 . we 'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships . because , of course , whilst hefcw will face changes , our relationship with and how we manage the fe sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift . so , the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector , close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation , those really important relationships in a way\u2014 . so , it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen , and that 's my intention . dawn bowden am : okay . well , then , of course , the university of wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for hefcw to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters . so , i think , from what you 're saying , you would n't be expecting that to happen . just the fact that they 've got the power does n't necessarily mean that that 's what they 're going to do . kirsty williams am : well , i think it 's important to recognise when hefcw can enforce its directions by way of an injunction . if they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally , i would n't describe those as minor matters , as a minister , if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and hefcw were using these powers to intervene . i would n't describe that as a minor matter . dawn bowden am : no . that 's fair enough . and , actually , on that point , we 've had some recent high-profile issues in swansea and trinity st david , and hefcw still have n't yet used their powers of intervention . do you find that surprising ?"
