    "answer": "project manager : the kinetic thing , can we just skip it , user interface : just cut off the kine yeah . project manager : because uh you have to shake it , but that 's not really innovative . user interface : or industrial designer : yeah . okay , sure . user interface : yeah . yeah , we just put a good battery it it . marketing : yeah . user interface : mobile phones nowadays . project manager : yeah . marketing : daniel . daniel , project manager : yo . sorry , marketing : what do you think about here . project manager : yeah , yes . marketing : what do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station project manager : yeah . marketing : just apart from the from the thing , so that you can uh put uh project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : rechargeable batteries in it and just project manager : okay . user interface : but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual . project manager : yeah , and not really . marketing : yeah , yeah , okay . project manager : but we if you forget about the kinetic , marketing : just an idea . user interface : yeah , that 's a cost reduc industrial designer : yeah , sure . marketing : yeah . project manager : well if we do that , we shall . user interface : ah . industrial designer : okay , project manager : so um industrial designer : well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . marketing : yeah , of course . industrial designer : and that would solve the budget problem . project manager : uh , b but i but the single-curved is just oh user interface : yeah , so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then industrial designer : yeah . user interface : no , it 's it 's just one curve and not a back uh curved i think . or industrial designer : it 's just yeah well , the single-curve that project manager : oh , okay , okay . industrial designer : yeah . exactly , yeah . project manager : so that 's wh tha that 's one option . user interface : or are these two curves ? uh marketing : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : and then w yeah , and then we could have it , but uh it 's its ' well it 's it 's r it is the main point of the the the the look . marketing : yeah , user interface : yeah , but what else uh do we have to cut out ?

project manager : uh well , the only uh thing that do n't user interface : do we have to u adapt it ? it 's single-curves . project manager : yeah , single-curved , but there 's a curve in it . so marketing : yeah . user interface : w could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back , and then we 're uh has industrial designer : yeah , we just make it flat . user interface : okay . industrial designer : but , you do l marketing : but , wha 'kay , look , what is the uh if you make it double-curved , it costs one euro more . user interface : more . yeah . you make it optional . marketing : but no , but does it have a lot of extra uh industrial designer : function . user interface : functional . marketing : fun function more like industrial designer : worth , does it have added worth ? user interface : uh , there 's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : no , um project manager : yeah , it 's really a static value . yeah . marketing : yeah , uh aesthetic . i mean , uh you make like eleven and a half euros profit instead of twelve and a half . but i do n't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price . project manager : yeah , it is . oh . industrial designer : yeah , well let 's assume it is . marketing : no , we ca n't go above that . industrial designer : we we should assume it i that it is . marketing : yeah ? project manager : yeah , okay . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but i i figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . marketing : yeah , okay . then it 's okay . industrial designer : r if you uh promote a kinetic um i kinetic remote control , i mean , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : do you think ? well , now you can shake your remote control . marketing : yeah , i think so . industrial designer : no , well , y i mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic . project manager : kinetic . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you have standard old battery control uh remote con marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : what a what about all the m the environment freaks ? user interface : yeah , but it does n't fit in our co cost profile . so marketing : not freaks , industrial designer : marketing : the envi no . industrial designer : true . marketing : i i think it 's it 's it look like this one . user interface : you ma can make an an especialised extra gold version . project manager : yeah ?
