    "query": "<s> why did industrial designer think that the power source was important when presenting the working design ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : like for example , voice recognition , right . that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that 's one perhaps constraint there . um th okay , the basic thing is there 's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . you know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button a_ , so i will do something with button a_ . so maybe button a_ is the power button , okay . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . um and i think that 's about it in terms of my design um . it 's fairly general , um and i guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you 're thinking , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : like um voice recognition , right , um , if it 's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we do n't have enough power . so it 's not really a constraint in that sense , project manager : okay . industrial designer : but i mean these are functionally , you know , the base , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm ."
