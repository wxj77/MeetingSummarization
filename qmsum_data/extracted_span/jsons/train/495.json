    "query": "<s> why did industrial designer think of it could be their selling point when discussing technical functions design ?",
    "answer": "user interface : so it 's one that 's got lots of buttons , it 's it 's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it 's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . yeah , it 's it 's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you 've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your tv . the one on the right is a lot more basic . it 's just got the essential functions of the tv changing the channel , play , stop , volume . it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it 's it 's swings and roundabouts . there are disadvantages , you ca n't use it say to to freeze the television picture . uh there 's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . so we 've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two . um as i said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things . um personally wa what i want from a remote control is a device that 's simple , it it 's easy to use , uh it 's got big buttons for doing the things i do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . it it does everything that i need it to uh , as i said before , i 'm quite lazy , i do n't wan na walk across the room just to adjust my television . i also want something that that looks cool , um and that that feels good , that 's ergonomically designed . project manager : mm 'kay . thank you very much . that was very useful . it 's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes . um . and neither of them were very pretty , you know ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : industrial designer : i think that could be our selling point . marketing : a fashion fashion remote . industrial designer : right . user interface : i think there 's there 's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . and i think that 's that 's why companies like apple 've 've 've made a lot of progress . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah ."
