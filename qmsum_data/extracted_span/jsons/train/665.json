    "answer": "postdoc a : and then i also the final thing i have for transcription is that i made a purchase of some other headphones because of the problem of low gain in the originals . and and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones , and actually i i mean , i i think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the the choice . we 'd originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headsets grad f : yeah . ugh ! postdoc a : but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this with this respect to this particular task . phd h : well , return the old ones . grad f : it 's probably impedance matching problems . postdoc a : i do n't know exactly , grad f : but postdoc a : but we chose them because that 's what 's been used here by prominent projects in transcription . professor b : could be . postdoc a : so it i we had every reason to think they would work . grad f : mm - hmm . phd h : so you have spare headsets ? postdoc a : sorry , what ? phd h : you have spare headsets ? grad f : they 're just earphones . they 're not headsets . they 're not microphones . phd e : right . phd h : no , no . i mean , just earphones ? um , because i , uh , i could use one on my workstation , just to t because sometimes i have to listen to audio files and i do n't have to b go borrow it from someone and postdoc a : we have actua actually i have w well , the thing is , that if we have four people come to work for a day , i was i was hanging on to the others for , eh for spares , phd h : oh , ok . postdoc a : but i can tell you what i recommend . professor b : no , but you 'd if you yeah , w we should get it . phd h : sure . no problem . grad f : but if you need it , just get it . phd h : i just grad f : come on . phd h : right . professor b : yeah . if you need it . phd h : yeah . professor b : yeah . postdoc a : it 'd just have to be a s a separate order an added order . grad d : yeah , i still i still need to get a pair , too . professor b : they 're they 're they 're they 're pretty inexpensive . phd e : yeah , that we should order a cou uh , t two or three or four , actually . professor b : yeah . grad d : i 'm using one of these . yeah . phd e : we have phd h : i think i have a pair that i brought from home , but it 's f just for music listening professor b : no . just just just just buy them . phd e : sh - just get the model number phd h : and it 's not nnn . yeah . professor b : just buy them . phd e : and where do you buy these from ? phd h : yeah . postdoc a : cambridge soundworks , just down the street . phd e : like ? you just b go and b postdoc a : yeah . they always have them in stock . professor b : yeah . phd e : that 'd be a good idea . phd h : anyway . professor b : yeah . grad f : w uh , could you email out the brand ? postdoc a : oh , sure . yeah . ok . grad f : cuz i think sounds like people are interested . grad d : yeah . professor b : yeah . grad d : definitely . postdoc a : it 's made a difference in in how easy . yeah . professor b : i realized something i should talk about . so what 's the other thing on the agenda actually ? grad f : uh , the only one was don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again . grad d : yeah . u it 's short . i mean , if you wan na go , we can just throw it in at the end . professor b : no , no . why do n't you why do n't you go ahead since it 's short . grad d : um , well , uh . grad f : oh , i thought you meant the disk space . yeah , we know disk space is short . phd h : the disk space was short . yeah . that 's what i thought too . phd e : that 's a great ambiguity . professor b : yeah . phd e : it 's one of these it 's it 's social professor b : it 's i i i it i phd e : and , uh , discourse level grad d : yeah . phd e : and professor b : yeah , it 's great . yeah , phd e : sorry . professor b : double double grad f : yeah , it was really goo phd e : see , if i had that little scratch - pad , i would have made an x there . grad d : thank you , thank you . grad f : uh , well , we 'll give you one then . professor b : yeah . grad d : um . so , um , without thinking about it , when i offered up my hard drive last week grad f : oh , no . grad d : um , this is always a suspect phrase . phd e : it was while i was out of town . grad d : but , um , no . i , uh i realized that we 're going to be doing a lot of experiments , um , o for this , uh , paper we 're writing , so we 're probably gon na need a lot more we 're probably gon na need that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive . but , um , we also have someone else coming in that 's gon na help us out with some stuff . professor b : we 've just ordered a hundred gigabytes . grad d : so ok . we just need to phd e : i think we need , like , another eighteen gig disk to be safe . professor b : well , we 're getting three thirty thirty - sixes . right ? that are going into the main f file server . phd c : markham 's ordering and they should be coming in soon . grad d : w well . so so grad f : soon ? grad d : yeah . i mean , i guess the thing is is , all i need is to hang it off , like , the person who 's coming in , sonali 's , computer . phd h : oh , so so , you mean the d the internal the disks on the machines that we just got ? grad d : whew . or we can move them . phd c : these are gon na go onto abbott . grad f : ne - new disks . phd h : or extra disk ? professor b : onto abbott , the file server . grad d : so are we gon na move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in ? grad f : on phd h : oh , oh . ok . grad f : yeah . phd e : uh , i grad f : once they come in . sure . grad d : ok . that 's fine . phd e : do when when is this planned for roughly ? phd c : they should be i i imagine next week or something . phd e : ok . so grad f : if you 're if you 're desperate , i have some space on my drive . grad d : i think if i 'm grad f : but i i vacillate between no space free and a few gig free . grad d : yeah . i think i can find something if i 'm desperate phd e : yeah . grad d : and , um , in the meantime i 'll just hold out . that was the only thing i wanted to bring up . phd c : it should be soon . we we should professor b : so there 's another hundred gig . so . grad d : alright . great . phd h : mm - hmm . professor b : ok . it 's great to be able to do it , grad d : that 's it . professor b : just say `` oh yeah , a hundred gig , phd e : good . professor b : no big deal `` . grad d : yeah . grad f : yeah . a hundred gig here , a hundred gig there . phd e : well , each meeting is like a gig or something , grad f : it 's eventually real disk space . professor b : yeah ."
