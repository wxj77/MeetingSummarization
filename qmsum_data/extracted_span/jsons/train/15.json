    "answer": "lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now on early help and enhanced support from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . good morning . in terms of local primary mental health support services , what is your understanding of the issues leading to some health boards not meeting the mental health ( wales ) measure 2010 targets for assessment and therapy for children and young people , and how much of this is due to an increase in demand ? carol shillabeer : yes , thanks very much . so , it 's important to say , i think , at the outset , just by way of reminder , that the target , quite rightly , changed for children and young people . the target changed some years ago for adults , so it was only right that there was an equalisation around children . so , the services were working , a couple of years ago , with significant demand and then a change in the standard . i think you 're absolutely right ; your question alludes to the fact that some health boards are struggling to maintain the full performance around seeing children , particularly within the 28 days . i would say\u2014 . and we 've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce , the staff , who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health , into a bit more of the secondary element , which is why the review being undertaken by the nhs delivery unit into primary care camhs is so critical , because , actually , if we do n't have\u2014and i believe we do n't have\u2014enough capacity in that part of the system , then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this . so , i think we will have seen , by the evidence submission , that demand has increased , not just in wales but in the uk , and it has increased significantly . we are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand\u2014so , we have more contacts , more staff , shorter access times , so that is a good news story . we 've not got it completely sustained at this stage , and therefore the focus of the delivery unit 's primary care camhs report is what more can we do in that part of the system to help to see children and young people or provide consultation and liaison to others and support people at that level of intervention . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . i know , from my own experience as a constituency am , i have families who tell me that they ca n't get into the early interventions and eventually things just become so\u2014they end up in the more specialist ones and believe that that's\u2014 . and i do n't like to put it in resource terms , but it 's false economy in terms of the impact on the child and the family , but , obviously , in terms of cost as well . do you find that that 's a common theme across wales ? carol shillabeer : yes . i think that the thrust of that is absolutely right . so , we absolutely need to see children and families at the earliest intervention and that 's why this is a whole system , not compartmentalised . i think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help\u2014hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist camhs , but can be supported , often by telephone , at that earlier stage . my sense of where we go next , in terms of , you know , you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle ' , as you referred to it in your report , is to make sure we 've got a fully joined-up , multi-agency team approach to that . and i think that will need some resourcing to support that , yet to be fully determined . but yesterday 's announcement about youth work , the government 's commitment to primary care , camhs , et cetera\u2014that 's all going to be very helpful to prevent those young people having to go into specialist camhs . and just a final note on that , if i may\u2014at the beginning of the programme , we had a report from hafal called 'making sense ' and there were 10 key asks , if you like , of the system and the service from young people who had experience of the service . they said , 'please do n't medicalise it'\u2014i 'm paraphrasing now , of course\u2014'please do n't medicalise it ; please focus on supporting teachers and others who can support us at an earlier stage and then , when we really need help , please ensure that it is there at that more specialist level . ' that 's been a bit of a guiding principle for the programme . so , that reflects the questions that you were asking , really . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . what are the outcomes of the stakeholder workshop held last week on early help and enhanced support ? and how are the actions going to be taken forward and implemented ? and also , given that the together for children and young people programme comes to an end in october of this year , who , in your view , is best placed to forward this work stream , and what will be the biggest challenges ? it 's a bit of a long question , so , break it up however you like . carol shillabeer : that 's absolutely fine . janet finch-saunders am : and what will be the biggest challenges that they will face ? carol shillabeer : yes , i think that 's helpfully laid out in three stages . so , you 're absolutely right , there was a highly successful workshop last week really focusing on early help and enhanced support . it brought all of the agencies together , which was\u2014and actually had a bit of a waiting list , apparently , for places . so , there was a lot of demand and a lot of interest in this . in relation to the next steps , there is a planning group reflection in early july , in terms of the outcomes of the workshop or the outputs of the workshop , and there are three commitments that have been made to this stage . one is that we develop those values-led approaches that will bring multiple agencies together to have that common purpose . the second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area , and then , thirdly , to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps . so , that 's the next stage of that . i 'm pretty sure we 'll come on shortly\u2014or hopefully\u2014to the potential of the regional partnership boards . there is some work that we are doing as a programme with the children 's commissioner in terms of working more with the regional partnership boards in taking forward this work . so , that will run alongside . but during the summer , then , we will be developing that framework approach , and we will be participating in the association of directors of social services conference in september , and then a follow-up workshop in october on this matter . on your question of 'well , what happens after the programme ? ' we are currently working on legacy arrangements for the programme . i 'm pretty secure on the specialist camhs element . that will move , most likely , to the camhs network , which is part of the nhs mental health network . i actually chair the mental health network and that 's one part of that . the whole-school approach element is already settled in government and we 've got a connection in to that . the question that 's outstanding is where the early help and enhanced support and the neurodevelopmental will go . i am currently in discussions with welsh government officials around that . i can be very clear of my own view that there needs to be a confident and clear legacy arrangement for this work . we can not afford that we 've come so far for this not now to proceed . i think there 's a huge momentum behind this . i do n't see there would be any obstacles\u2014i hope\u2014in getting that commitment translated into a strong approach , as we move forward . so , i 'm not in a position to say , 'and the legacy arrangements will be\u2014 ' , but i am in a position to say that i 'm having those discussions with welsh government officials . they know my view that we 've got to put something in place that is strong and secure as we move forward , and i believe that they are supportive of that ."
