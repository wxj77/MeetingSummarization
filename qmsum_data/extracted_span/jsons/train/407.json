    "answer": "grad c : uh w do we wan na get going beyond more , which is sort of the professor d : well , ok , so let 's let 's take let 's i i think your suggestion is good , which is we 'll do a b uh a batch . ok . and , uh , fey , how long is it gon na be till you have ten subjects ? couple days ? or thr f a a week ? or i do n't i do n't have a feel for th undergrad e : um i can yeah , i mean i s i think can probably schedule ten people , uh , whenever . professor d : well , it 's it 's up to you , i mean i j i uh e we do n't have any huge time pressure . it 's just when you have t undergrad e : how long will it be ? professor d : yeah . undergrad e : um i i would say maybe two weeks . professor d : oh , ok . so let 's do this . let 's plan next monday , ok , to have a review of what we have so far . grad c : this means audio , but professor d : and huh ? grad c : no transcriptions of course , yeah . professor d : no , we wo n't have the transcriptions , but what we should be able to do and i do n't know if , fey , if you will have time to do this , but it would be great if you could , um , not transcribe it all , but pick out uh , some stuff . i mean we could lis uh just sit here and listen to it all . are you gon na have the audio on the web site ? ok . grad c : until we reach the gigabyte thing and david johnson s ki kills me . and we 're gon na put it on the web site . yeah . professor d : oh , we could get i mean , you can buy another disk for two hundred dollars , right ? i mean it 's it 's not like ok . so , we 'll take care of david johnson . grad c : no , he uh , he he has been solving all our problems or is wonderful , undergrad e : take care of him . professor d : alright . so we 'll buy a disk . but anyway , so , um , if you if you can think of a way to uh , point us to th to interesting things , sort of as you 're doing this or or something uh , make your make notes or something that that this is , you know , something worth looking at . and other than that , yeah i guess we 'll just have to uh , listen although i guess it 's only ten minutes each , right ? roughly . undergrad e : well , i guess . i 'm not sure how long it 's actually going to take . grad c : the reading task is a lot shorter . that was cut by fifty percent . and the reading , nobody 's interested in that except for the speech people . professor d : right . no , we do n't care about that at all . grad c : so . it 's actually like five minutes dialogue . professor d : i b my guess is it 's gon na be ten . grad c : ten minutes is long . professor d : people i understand , but people people you know uh undergrad e : it feels like a long time grad c : yeah . it feels like forever when you 're doing it , professor d : yeah . grad c : but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds . professor d : yeah . grad b : yeah . professor d : could be . ok . i was thinking people would , you know , hesitate and whatever . whatever it is we 'll we 'll deal with it . grad c : yeah , it 's not and it 's fun . professor d : ok , so that 'll be that 'll be um on on the web page . that 's great . um but anyway yeah , so i think it 's a good idea to start with the sort of relatively straight forward res just response system . and then if we want to uh get them to start doing uh multiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them an um tell them which things are near each other and you know , any of that stuff . uh you know , `` which things would you like to do tuesday morning ? `` grad c : yeah . professor d : so yeah i th that seems pretty straight forward . undergrad e : but were you saying that grad c : i need those back by the way . undergrad e : yeah . grad c : that 's for professor d : i 'm sorry , fey , what ? undergrad e : that w maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category ? professor d : that 's what i was suggesting for the first round , yeah . grad b : so rather than having zoo and castle . undergrad e : and then , i mean , they could be alternate versions of the same if you wanted data on different constructions . professor d : they could , but i but i uh tha eh they c yeah , but uh but undergrad e : like one person gets the version with the zoo as a choice , and the other person gets the professor d : you could , but i but i i i think in the short run , grad c : and no , th the per the person do n't get it . i mean , this is why we did it , because when we gave them just three tasks for w part - a and three tasks for part - b a professor d : right . yeah . undergrad e : well no , they could still choose . they just would n't be able to choose both zoo and say , touring the castle . grad c : exactly . this is limiting the choices , but yeah . right . ok , sorry . but um i i think this approach will very well work , but the person was able to look at it and say `` ok , this is what i would actually do . `` undergrad e : yeah . grad c : yeah . undergrad e : he was vicious . grad c : ok , we got ta we got ta disallow uh traveling to zoos and uh castles at the same time , sort of undergrad e : i mean there they are significantly different , but . grad c : but no , they 're i mean they 're sort of this is where tour becomes you know tourists maybe a bit different undergrad e : yeah , i guess so . grad c : and , um , these are just places where you you enter um , much like here . professor d : yeah . grad c : but we can uh professor d : yeah , in fact if y if y if you use the right verb for each in common , like at you know , `` attend a theater , symphony or opera `` is is a group , and `` tour the university , castle or zoo `` , grad c : mm - hmm yeah . professor d : all of these d do have this kind of `` tour `` um aspect about the way you would go to them . and uh , the movie theater is probably also uh e is a `` attend `` et cetera . grad c : attend , yeah . professor d : so it may turn out to be not so many different kinds of things , grad c : hmm , mm - hmm . professor d : and then , what one would expect is that that the sentence types would uh their responses would tend to be grouped according to the kind of activity , you would expect . grad b : mm - hmm . phd f : but i mean i it seem that um there is a difference between going to see something , and things like `` exchange money `` or `` dine out `` professor d : oh , absolutely . yeah . phd f : uh @ @ function , yeah . grad c : yeah , this is where yeah th the function stuff is definitely different and the getting information or g stuff yeah . ok . but this is open . so since people gon na still pick something , we we 're not gon na get any significant amount of redundancy . and for reasons , we do n't want it , really , in that sense . and um we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people asking , oh , for different things with or with a computer . and so if you can think of any other sort of high level tasks a tourist may do just always just m mail them to us and we 'll sneak them into the collection . we 're not gon na do much statistical stuff with it . professor d : we do n't have enough . grad c : no . but it seems like since we since we are getting towards uh subject uh fifty subjects and if we can keep it up um to a uh sort of five four - ish per week rate , we may even reach the one hundred before fey t takes off to chicago . undergrad e : that means that one hundred people have to be interested . grad b : good luck . undergrad e : yeah . professor d : well , um , these are all f people off campus s from campus so far , undergrad e : yeah . professor d : right ? undergrad e : yeah . professor d : so we yeah we do n't know how many we can get next door at the uh shelter for example . uh for ten bucks , probably quite a few . grad b : yeah . that 's right . professor d : yeah . so , alright , so let 's go let 's go back then , to the the chart with all the decisions and stuff , and see how we 're doing . do do people think that , you know this is is gon na um cover what we need , or should we be thinking about more ? grad c : okay , in terms of decision nodes ? i mean , go - there is is a yes or no . right ? grad b : mm - hmm . grad c : i 'm also interested in th in this `` property `` uh line here , so if you look at sorry , look at that um , timing was um i have these three . do we need a final differentiation there ? now , later on the same tour , sometimes on the next tour . grad b : what 's this idea of `` next tour `` ? i mean grad c : it 's sort of next day , so you 're doing something now and you have planned to do these three four things , grad b : mm - hmm . grad c : and you can do something immediately , grad b : mm - hmm . grad c : you could sort of tag it on to that tour grad b : or ok . grad c : or you can say this is something i would do s i wan na do sometime l in my life , basically . grad b : ok . ok . so so this tour is sort of just like th the idea of current s round of of touristness or whatever , professor d : right . yeah . yeah , probably between stops back at the hotel . grad b : ok . got it ."
