    "query": "<s> will the minister of foreign affairs thank taiwan officially for the donation ?",
    "answer": "hon . ed fast ( abbotsford , cpc ) : thank you , mr . chair . this question is directed to the minister of foreign affairs . on march 28 , the minister personally tweeted out a thank you to the people 's republic of china for donating ppe to canada . this tweet happened within three hours of china 's announcement of that gift . as it turned out , much of the ppe was defective and could not be used . more recently , taiwan donated half a million surgical masks to canada , yet here we are , two weeks later , and the minister has yet to personally thank taiwan for its generosity . will the minister now thank this free and democratic country for its generous gift to canadians ? hon . franois-philippe champagne ( minister of foreign affairs ) : mr . chair , i 'd like to thank my colleague for the question . indeed , we are very grateful to every nation for helping canada . this is a global pandemic that knows no borders . we have been expressing our thanks to many nations that have contributed . we will continue to do so . it is important in a time of pandemic , mr . chair , that we not play politics and that humanity comes together . i can say , after my covid foreign ministers call , that the world community has come together to make sure that supply chains will remain intact and that we will have transit hubs and air bridges . we will continue to work with every nation when it comes to health . this is a public good . we want to work together with everyone . the chair : we will go back to mr. fast now . hon . ed fast : well , mr . chair , i did n't hear a thank you there , so i 'm going to try again . on may 4 , the government of taiwan delivered 25,000 surgical masks to the government of british columbia . on hand were b.c . minister of citizens ' services anne kang and minister of state for child care katrina chen , who , as ministers , officially thanked the government of taiwan for its donation . again , will the minister now do the right thing and , on behalf of canadians , recognize the generosity of taiwan and thank its government for that timely donation ? hon . franois-philippe champagne : mr . chair , as i said to you before , canada is grateful to all who have given supplies to canada . this is a common endeavour . we are thankful . we are grateful to every nation and we will continue to be . as i said , when it comes to global health , when it comes to helping each other , i think it is a duty for all to come together . we are grateful and thankful for all those who have agreed to help canada and canadians from coast to coast to coast in times of need . i 've repeated that and have said many times in many forums that we are grateful and thankful to all of those who are helping canada . hon . ed fast : well , mr . chair , again there was no specific thank you to taiwan . the government of taiwan has been the world leader in successfully fighting the covid-19 pandemic . we have a lot to learn from them and their response . sadly , the people 's republic of china continues to oppose taiwan 's membership in the world health organization . will the minister now do the right thing and assure canadians that he will fully support efforts to grant taiwan membership in the world health organization ?"
