    "query": "<s> what did the team think about the diversity of languages they needed ?",
    "answer": "phd g : yeah , and perhaps , um we were thinking that perhaps the cross - language issue is not , uh , so big of a issue . well , w w we perhaps we should not focus too much on that cross - language stuff . i mean , uh , training training a net on a language and testing a for another language . professor f : uh - huh . but that 's phd g : mmm . perhaps the most important is to have neural networks trained on the target languages . but , uh , with a general database general databases . u so that th well , the the guy who has to develop an application with one language can use the net trained o on that language , or a generic net , professor f : uh , depen it depen it depends how you mean `` using the net `` . phd g : but not trained on a professor f : so , if you 're talking about for producing these discriminative features that we 're talking about you ca n't do that . because because the what they 're asking for is is a feature set . right ? and so , uh , we 're the ones who have been weird by by doing this training . but if we say , `` no , you have to have a different feature set for each language , `` i think this is ver gon na be very bad . phd g : yeah . you think so . grad c : that 's professor f : so oh yeah . yeah . i mean , in principle , i mean conceptually , it 's sort of like they want a re @ @ { comment } well , they want a replacement for mel cepstra . so , we say `` ok , this is the year two thousand , we 've got something much better than mel cepstra . it 's , you know , gobbledy - gook . `` ok ? and so we give them these gobbledy - gook features but these gobbledy - gook features are supposed to be good for any language . cuz you do n't know who 's gon na call , and you know , i mean so it 's it 's it 's , uh , uh how do you know what language it is ? somebody picks up the phone . so thi this is their image . someone picks up the phone , right ? phd g : well , i { comment } chh professor f : and and he he picks up the ph phd g : yeah , but the the application is there is a target language for the application . professor f : yeah . y y y phd g : so , if a professor f : well . but , no but , y you you pick up the phone , phd g : well . professor f : you talk on the phone , phd g : yeah ? professor f : and it sends features out . ok , so the phone does n't know what a what what your language is . phd g : yeah , if yeah . if it 's th in the phone , but professor f : but that 's the image that they have . phd g : well , it that that could be th at the server 's side , professor f : it could be , phd g : and , well . mmm , yeah . professor f : but that 's the image they have , right ? so that 's that 's i mean , one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years . but the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the uh , on the phone . so that 's that 's what we 're involved in . we might might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years , but that 's that 's that 's what they 're asking for . so so i think that th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language . now , it 's the ogi , uh , folks ' perspective right now that probably that 's not the biggest deal . and that the biggest deal is the , um envir acoustic - environment mismatch . and they may very well be right , but i i was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true . if that 's true , we do n't need to worry so much . maybe maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that that that the rest does n't matter . um , the other thing is , uh , this notion of training to uh which i i guess they 're starting to look at up there , { comment } training to something more like articulatory features . uh , and if you have something that 's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across , you know , a wide range of languages . phd g : yeah . professor f : uh , but yeah , so i do n't th i know unfortunately i do n't i see what you 're comi where you 're coming from , i think , but i do n't think we can ignore it . phd g : so we we really have to do test with a real cross - language . i mean , tr for instance training on english and testing on italian , or or we can train or else , uh , can we train a net on , uh , a range of languages and which can include the test the test @ @ the target language , grad c : test on an unseen . phd g : or professor f : yeah , so , um , there 's there 's , uh this is complex . so , ultimately , uh , as i was saying , i think it does n't fit within their image that you switch nets based on language . now , can you include , uh , the the target language ? phd g : yeah . professor f : um , from a purist 's standpoint it 'd be nice not to because then you can say when because surely someone is going to say at some point , `` ok , so you put in the german and the finnish . uh , now , what do you do , uh , when somebody has portuguese ? `` you know ? um , and uh , however , you are n't it is n't actually a constraint in this evaluation . so i would say if it looks like there 's a big difference to put it in , then we 'd make note of it , and then we probably put in the other , because we have so many other problems in trying to get things to work well here that that , you know , it 's not so bad as long as we we note it and say , `` look , we did do this `` . phd a : and so , ideally , what you 'd wan na do is you 'd wan na run it with and without the target language and the training set for a wide range of languages . professor f : uh . yeah . phd g : yeah , perhaps . yeah . phd a : and that way you can say , `` well , `` you know , `` we 're gon na build it for what we think are the most common ones `` , professor f : yeah . phd g : yeah . phd a : but if that somebody uses it with a different language , you know , `` here 's what 's you 're l here 's what 's likely to happen . `` professor f : yeah , cuz the truth is , is that it 's it 's not like there are i mean , al although there are thousands of languages , uh , from uh , uh , the point of view of cellular companies , there are n't . phd a : right . professor f : there 's you know , there 's fifty or something , you know ? so , uh , an and they are n't you know , with the exception of finnish , which i guess it 's pretty different from most most things . uh , it 's it 's , uh most of them are like at least some of the others . and so , our guess that spanish is like italian , and and so on . i guess finnish is a is is a little bit like hungarian , supposedly , right ? phd a : i do n't know anything about finnish . professor f : or is i think well , i kn oh , well i know that h uh , h i mean , i 'm not a linguist , but i guess hungarian and finnish and one of the one of the languages from the former soviet union are in this sort of same family . but they 're just these , you know , uh countries that are pretty far apart from one another , have i guess , people rode in on horses and brought their"
