    "answer": "industrial designer : would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . so we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . possibly ? user interface : what do you mean by the circular section ? industrial designer : j yeah yeah yeah j yeah user interface : like all of that bottom bit ? project manager : industrial designer : just this little bit is that i think that 's still um a video remote part , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so maybe we could get rid of that as well . user interface : yeah . and i do n't really think that you need nine numbers . project manager : well b uh w user interface : i mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? i think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . project manager : well th the on the user interface : like how often do you hit nine ? project manager : well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and we 'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . but but industrial designer : it 's just people are used to seeing that , so if we did n't have them then they might think it 's project manager : but , well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but uh i mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? i would have thought that uh it 's forever expanding and at the moment we 've got although you 've onl you 've got the five standard , you 've got the b_b_c_ have come up with a further six industrial designer : project manager : and uh there 's uh i do n't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh sky and various other um various others . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so i would 've thought that we would n't , you know , rather okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it 'll take a second user interface : project manager : 'cause you have to be able to stop it . maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . y you 'd want you 'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted . industrial designer : user interface : um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that 's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah , i s i suppose in a sense you could have um if you 've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and that would cut down your time . user interface : mm . um . project manager : anyway . user interface : but i think a lot of um like cable and sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you 'd have another remote for all of those channels . industrial designer : okay , yeah . user interface : like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers project manager : whatever . user interface : yeah . marketing : project manager : okay . okay . limit the number of buttons , user friendly . user interface : but i suppose nine 's not really excessive . industrial designer : i suppose with nine you 've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it 's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . user interface : i suppose it does make a good pattern . industrial designer : so with that we 'd kind of by-pass any problems with project manager : yeah well that 's true , yeah , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that that makes sense . industrial designer : yeah . 'cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need . project manager : yeah . does . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so w so what was the circular thing that you were user interface : okay . um i think that 's just for a video , so we would n't need any of that at all . industrial designer : so we could get it down to what ? project manager : if it 's just for tv , which is what it is at the moment . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so we get to how many buttons have we got ? we 've just got ten , eleven twelve th we got fourteen that we need . i guess . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um which is n't really too many . that 'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote . project manager : but the but that 's relying on the television market changing to an automatic industrial designer : so that 'll be in marketing : yeah . project manager : and if it is at the moment , that 's fine . but at the moment it 's not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : and the idea is to have an international market industrial designer : yeah yeah . project manager : which is marketing : yeah . project manager : and it 's also m it 's the the product we 've got is something that 's at the i would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we 're not really going for something that 's uh terribly high-tech . marketing : yeah . i s i suppose um if people are buying remotes , then they 're probably buying it to replace another remote project manager : possibly . marketing : 'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so . project manager : that 's right . marketing : i mean we 're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . industrial designer : yeah . so how would this menu function work ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : would you maybe have like one menu button , then you 'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . user interface : yeah , marketing : yeah , user interface : like the volume or something . marketing : that would be a good idea , yeah . industrial designer : okay . user interface : yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . my dad was watching a film the other week marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and it was too dark , so i had to go through it and turn the brightness up . industrial designer : we 're gon na have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide presu uh i think it 'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work . marketing : uh i 'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . project manager : industrial designer : right , okay um . marketing : so maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , so you 're basically pressing industrial designer : that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so . marketing : right . project manager : okay , well . user interface : well , if we 're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there 's kind of um everything else revealed ? marketing : okay . yeah . project manager : so y ah that 's a very good idea . user interface : so you do n't use it that much , you do n't have to see it all the time . but it 's all there if you need it . industrial designer : that is that is a good idea actually . marketing : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : sor sort of a second . project manager : so you keep um user interface : like a hidden panel . project manager : right we 've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so i 've been told . i do n't know if you 've got the same . industrial designer : okay . uh not quite , but i guess . project manager : okay . so so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back . industrial designer : keep the other buttons but hide them away . user interface : hmm . and that 'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad does n't like anything that you 've got to kinda flick through a menu , but he can pretty much read a button if it 's displayed properly . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so um we 're gon na have to have to work out what 's gon na be on these other functions as as well . so we 're gon na have like two separate two separate lists , i guess . marketing : yeah . project manager : that 's right . marketing : yeah . project manager : data functions hidden at back . can bring out when needed . marketing : so th the the detailed ones would be sort of brightness , user interface : yeah . marketing : uh sorta project manager : that 's right so we 're dis so you 've got which ones are gon na be on the front and which ones are gon na be on the back . we have to decide . industrial designer : so sh should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i guess so . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so on the project manager : so on front , industrial designer : about the number . project manager : numbers , industrial designer : um the volume up and down . user interface : and the volume ? project manager : volume . industrial designer : shall we have a mute button as well ? project manager : sorry ? industrial designer : a mute button as well . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . or user interface : yeah i think they 're handy . marketing : mm-hmm . and probably a power one as well . dunno . user interface : i know it 's probably like um not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity . have you seen the adverts ? like if you boil the kettle that 's full that 's a waste . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : if you leave your telly on standby it powers blackpool for a certain amount of time . marketing : yeah . user interface : like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby . industrial designer : but then they might not buy it if they have n't got one . 'cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change . user interface : yeah , it 's maybe too much of a big issue for here . marketing : yeah . project manager : so so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we can send out a flier with the device saying that you should n't leave it on stand-by . user interface : uh-oh danger sign . industrial designer : i think you probably should . project manager : user interface : yeah , but a little bit smaller . marketing : okay . user interface : compromise . project manager : well . industrial designer : um are we gon na have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? marketing : um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . industrial designer : okay , so we 'll have um user interface : right . industrial designer : so we 've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? project manager : channel up and down . what else have we got ? what was that , sixteen ? marketing : numbers is ten , volume is twelve , project manager : volume button . how many volumes ? marketing : th yeah si one up , one down . project manager : right okay . user interface : on mute . marketing : and a mute , yeah . that 's sixteen is n't it , yeah . industrial designer : is there anything else ? um . marketing : i do n't think so , no . project manager : power button , stand-by , channel , up and down . so is that it ? user interface : so . project manager : okay . that 's sixteen buttons , you reckon . and then at the back ? marketing : you 've got brightness and contrast . industrial designer : maybe if we 're gon na run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they 're gon na be . user interface : and then project manager : okay . so on the back it 'll have brightness , contrast , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . project manager : anything else ? you 're also gon na have the channel tuner , as it were . user interface : uh there 's audio functions . industrial designer : so tuner up and down , i guess . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : tuner , would that have up and down ? . industrial designer : um up tune one way , tune the o user interface : i think they normally do . project manager : okay . okay . industrial designer : i i dunno i dunno possibly . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . so you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wan na press enter to select it , yeah . industrial designer : oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select . yeah , okay . um i guess we 're keeping s it simple . we do n't really need any other audio funct uh functions because it 's just volume up , volume down . project manager : um up volume , yeah , i would have thought so . marketing : yeah . user interface : so i think um there 's quite a lot of like dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . project manager : okay . industrial designer : do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , marketing : yeah . user interface : um maybe for the younger market . industrial designer : or do you have to do it via the remote ? user interface : um i think they 've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . industrial designer : yeah i suppose if we 've got their if they 've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : oh no , i mean um like there 's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the tv remote . industrial designer : oh , okay . right . user interface : but i do n't really know what they 're for , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i 've never used them . i just know they 're something to do with dolby . industrial designer : maybe unless something comes up then we should i think"
