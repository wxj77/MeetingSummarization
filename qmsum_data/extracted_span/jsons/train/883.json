    "answer": "grad a : hmm ! this is something you ha you get used to as a programmer , right ? you know , { comment } and it 's cool , it works out that way . grad e : hmm . so , the the people at saarbruecken and i decided not to touch it ever again . yeah , that would work . ok . um i was gon na ask you where something is and what we know about that . grad a : where ok . grad b : where the `` where is `` construction is . grad a : what what thing is this ? grad e : where is x ? oh , but by uh , we can ask , uh , did you get to read all four hundred words ? professor c : i did . grad e : was it ok ? was it ? professor c : yeah . grad d : i i wa i was looking at it . it does n't follow logically . it does n't the first paragraph does n't seem to have any link to the second paragraph . grad a : and so on . professor c : yeah . grad d : yeah . grad e : hmm . that professor c : you know , i yeah , it grad d : each paragraph is good , though . i li professor c : i i yeah . well , it it 's fine . grad a : it was written by committee . professor c : anyway . um . but c the meeting looks like it 's , it 's gon na be good . so . i think it 's uh grad e : yeah . grad b : yeah , i did n't know about it until robert told me , like , professor c : yeah , i i ra i ran across it in i do n't even know where , you know some just some weird place . and , uh , yeah , i i 'm surprised i did n't know about it grad b : y yeah . well , yeah . i was like , why did n't dan tell me ? professor c : since we know all the invited speakers , an grad a : right . professor c : right , or some anyway . so but anyway , yeah . i so i i did see that . oh wha yeah . before we get started on this st so i also had a nice email correspondence with daphne kohler , who said yes indeed she would love to work with us on the , um , you know , using these structured belief - nets and stuff but starting in august , that she 's also got a new student working on this and that we should get in touch with them again in august and then we 'll figure out a way for you uh you to get seriously connected with , um their group . so that 's , uh looks pretty good . and um yeah , i 'll say it now . so , um and it looks to me like { comment } we 're now at a good point to do something start working on something really hard . we 've been so far working on things that are easy . uh , w which is { comment } mental spaces and uh and - or grad b : it 's hard . yeah , it 's hard . grad a : yeah . grad b : yeah . professor c : it 's a hard puzzle . but the other part of it is the way they connect to these , uh , probabilistic relational models . so there 's all the problems that the linguists know about , about mental spaces , and the cognitive linguists know about , but then there 's this problem of the belief - net people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with temporal belief - nets . uh , which they call dynamic they incorrectly call dynamic belief - nets . so there 's a term `` dynamic belief - net `` , does n't mean that . it means time slices . and srini used those and people use them . uh . but one of the things i w would like to do over the next , uh , month , it may take more , { comment } is to st understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them for multiple worlds and uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be , but also what that would translate into in terms of belief - net and the inferences . so the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff , so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you 've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate uh , belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate . but that 's g that 's , as far as i can tell , it 's it 's putting together two real hard problems . one is the linguistic part of what are the couplings and and when you have a certain , uh , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings , you know , between let 's say between the past and the present , or any other one of these things and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work if it 's got um , let 's say one in in , you know , different tenses or my beliefs and your beliefs , or any of these other ones of of multiple models . so um you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion is that we start digging into them both , uh , in a way we that , you know , th hopefully turns out to be consistent , so that the um . and sometimes it 's actually easier to solve two hard problems than one grad a : yeah . professor c : because they constrain each other . i mean if you 've got huge ra huge range of possible choices um we 'll see . but anyway , so that 's , um grad a : oh yeah , like uh , i solved the the problem of um we were talking about how do you various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote `` count as a noun phrase `` , you know , occur as an argument of a higher construction , but a bare singular stem does n't get to act that way ."
