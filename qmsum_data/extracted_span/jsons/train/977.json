    "answer": "marketing : uh evaluation . basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . um then we will it 's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . so um not seven steps , seven scale . so after we 've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . and uh the criteria based on real reactions ' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those i put together from the user requirements phase . 'kay . um if you flip the so , those are the criteria . and uh perhaps i could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we 've totally abandoned , which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points . project manager : marketing : put it mildly . so we have um true ? one , t seven , eight , oh . fourth . okay , so we have to go through each point . if we imagine it 's actually straight , and just give it a a score . so um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . i mean , uh is the homing thing still the locator , is that still user interface : yeah , that 's still part of the design . marketing : sure . and adam , we can keep that in ? project manager : yeah , i believe so . so i mean i do n't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , marketing : okay . project manager : 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element , marketing : sure . project manager : but i 'd like to think that we 've done something about finding the damn thing once we have . user interface : mm . mm . and making it a bright colour helps marketing : sure . user interface : with the personally i would have gone for purple . project manager : marketing : mm . bright colour . so we still have that noise thing , yeah ? user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : os on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it 's lost ? user interface : i 'd say number one . marketing : number one ? industrial designer : one . yeah . marketing : okay . number number one for the first criteria . user interface : i think w if it was just the sounder then th i mean something i 've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you ca n't quite pin it dow pin down where it is . marketing : yeah you can tell what room the mobile is industrial designer : what about what if the the volume on the tv 's turned up massively and uh you just wan na turn down the volume ca n't find remote . suppose you have to go to the tv and do it manually . mm . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : mm . um marketing : yeah . industrial designer : like y you would n't hear the speaker . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we 'll do is marketing : you wan na say something ? project manager : um if we can look at the criteria you 're gon na evaluate , and then we 'll come back to the product evaluation if that 's alright . marketing : that 's fine . project manager : yeah , is that marketing : oh that 's that 's fine . project manager : um so is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you 've covered ? and then we 'll come back pretty much promptly to this . marketing : what do you mean cr is there anything i wan na project manager : i is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ? marketing : um , a few . something i neglected from my initial research is that real reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . that is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . so they say we put the fashion in electronics , well they really mean it they they 're very big on fashion , project manager : okay . marketing : so . that 's this bit right here . and uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? i guess it 's just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it 's kinda condensed into one . and we can come back to it , you said . project manager : okay . no and which we will do very very shortly . um . okay . slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . um most of it stems from the use of the lcd which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well . um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a lcd , at which point we 've removed a large part of how we were gon na interface , require more buttons , etcetera . or what we did was that we um we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we 're just scraping it in , we 've got point two of a euro left over there . so we 're just managing it really . even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so i 've used what i think 's appropriate . with any luck that wo n't mean that we 've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . it blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a u_s_b_ connection is definitely not viable now . um . marketing : different languages ? project manager : that should still be viable . we 've got an advanced chip , we 've got the use of the lcd . so being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . marketing : yeah . project manager : um but what 's something we need to decide on is how we 're gon na go from here . we do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be . um . we can i can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um . i really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the lcd would n't be in this perfect place . it might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person . user interface : mm-hmm i suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular and have it s so that the uh the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . mm . project manager : okay . user interface : so that uh th project manager : it very much is about making concessions , unfortunately . um . marketing : do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ? i mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ? project manager : um b b b da is you mean on the plastic , or ? marketing : . project manager : let 's have a look . you now have as much information as i do . um . marketing : yeah , yeah . project manager : so as you can see here , for example , the battery really not very little choice in that one . we 've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we 're gon na do what we 're needing to . i 've said single curved . we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which i 've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber 's only got a value of two euros per unit . problem comes here as you can see in the interface . um if i 've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a euro here in that it 's not per push button . that might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what , four point five euros , which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong . even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we 're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . as you can see , the use of an l_c_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it 's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that was n't quite what i think they had in mind with a joystick . marketing : why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? that 's quite significantly expensive . project manager : i that 's something you 'll have to take up with the bean counters . um marketing : . industrial designer : user interface : mm . yeah . project manager : as you can see i mean that 's taken up well over half of the price . marketing : yeah . project manager : so um i 'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , but because we need to shed what was four euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design . marketing : we do n't even have uh speakers here . the like uh we uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? have we factored that in ? project manager : uh no , we have n't , not marketing : transmitter , receiver , speakers . plus the extra device itself that 's gon na be on a tv . industrial designer : marketing : is that gon na be a button , or project manager : that 'll it literally would just be a button . marketing : yeah . project manager : we might have to industrial designer : that 's too expensive is n't it ? project manager : it looks like almost nothing mm . oh good call , i missed that . marketing : i i mean it 's not on here , but um . project manager : that 's a very valid point . marketing : did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the lcd ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . well that 's yeah . project manager : so if we 're gon na go with the l_c_ display , then that 's marketing : what 's a hand dyna dynamo ? you have to wind it up ? project manager : i believe so , yeah . marketing : industrial designer : project manager : that would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such , marketing : technology . yeah . industrial designer : fashion . project manager : yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : so basically the only new thing is the lcd on the remote now . project manager : being manipulated by the joystick , yeah . industrial designer : oh , and joystick , yeah . project manager : which i 'm defining as scroll wheel . um . marketing : and we could n't replace the joystick , right ? because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , and that would be more expensive than a but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ? project manager : yeah it 's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , that that 's what i 've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation . industrial designer : so the lcd basically is the big selling point of project manager : if we remove the l_c_ display , we could save ourselves industrial designer : the remote . project manager : a fair amount . which you could industrial designer : but that 's what makes it uh original though , user interface : mm . i think if we remove the the l_c_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings marketing : yeah . industrial designer : is n't it ? user interface : and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control . marketing : yeah . yeah . um . uh k project manager : it 's a shame . we should possibly have if we could 've increased the price we could 've manufactured that and we could 've got something far closer to what we were hoping to . marketing : does this does this bear in mind that i mean it 's a bit ridiculous that they 're gon na charge us what is it , like this much money for three million if we 're gon na buy three million components , project manager : again , you 'll have to argue with the accountants on that one . marketing : you know . project manager : um but for the purposes of this meeting , i 'm we 're gon na have to stick with these figures . marketing : mm . 'kay . project manager : so , i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we 're gon na keep the l_c_ display 'cause it 's about what really separates us , despite the cost it 's gon na incur . um marketing : i think so . project manager : are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the lcd ? user interface : mm-hmm . um yeah i mean one thing , i mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep i mean keep the um the articulation ? project manager : it 's hard to tell . um i would say that you 're at least gon na take double curved , user interface : this is what i 'm wondering . project manager : and even then i 'm not quite sure if that 's incorporating the idea of articulation . marketing : yeah . user interface : no , i think i i it d that it need n't require it to be double curved . industrial designer : it can be s yeah , it can still be single curved , user interface : it 's uh it 's just it 's just it 's just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation . industrial designer : but project manager : single curved with articulation ? industrial designer : you just . marketing : could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? 'cause like we do we have re restrictions on software ? industrial designer : that 's what we need for the joystick i think though . user interface : mm . yeah , i mean marketing : oh but there has to be user interface : and i mean the uh i mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here , the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . um i mean yeah , project manager : but the curves all o over hand , user interface : on the on the lcd i mean although we 've done it with a curve it project manager : is it ? user interface : could just as easily be done um without curves . the curve that 's really needed is up here , marketing : joystick . user interface : to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand . marketing : okay . sure . okay , my bad . project manager : we would n't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal . marketing : so i think the product is not gon na perform so well for my criteria . project manager : which is what we can get onto now . as long as so are we gon na say w we have to keep an eye on the time as well , but we 're gon na say um single curved design marketing : oh , wait a minute . sample speaker ? what is a sample speaker ? is that somewhat similar to what we want ? project manager : it could well be , but at a cost of user interface : that 's that voice response thing that we got the email about . industrial designer : costs four . marketing : yeah . user interface : but i thought it was just completely pointless . marketing : you got a email about voice response ? user interface : yeah . marketing : i did not , user interface : alright . b i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could , you know , say hello to , and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice . project manager : okay , yeah we 'll definitely wo n't go with that one . marketing : we wo n't go with that one , did you say ? project manager : yeah , that 's voice recognition , so . marketing : i mean i we okay , okay . project manager : um . so , okay yeah , battery definitely , marketing : so it looks like we 're gon na get rid of the whole loca locator thing . project manager : it looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two euros , um . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . okay . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : maybe even slight well oh yeah , pretty much point two euros , i 'd say . so we 'll leave that one for now . we 'll just have industrial designer : are we going for a special colour at all ? project manager : it 's uh a case of um i 'm uh slightly unsure . one point five of a euro for one push button does n't sound quite right . so maybe it 's a case of a push button is maybe one or more . um . at which point if industrial designer : i was for a case . or had you already incorporated that ? marketing : oh , special colour for the case . project manager : well you got point five there . it 's literally a case of whether or not this is correct . i 'm not quite sure if they 're i do n't think they mean point five euros per button . user interface : okay , well marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : l let 's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose . project manager : there we go . user interface : because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room . marketing : w what 's the default colour ? white or black ? project manager : black 's probably the normal colour you 'd say , user interface : or grey . project manager : yeah . marketing : right . project manager : i quite like that colour that you 're fetching there , user interface : yellow . project manager : it 's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better . marketing : yeah . project manager : so will we go with that then ? user interface : okay . project manager : it 's not and we can see marketing : yeah . project manager : we 'll come back to uh your evaluation marketing : sure . project manager : which you 're probably now going to pan us but there we go . marketing : okay . okay . industrial designer : marketing : so uh project manager : just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , i 'm not sure how much time . we 've not hit the five minute mark warning yet , marketing : right okay . okay ."
