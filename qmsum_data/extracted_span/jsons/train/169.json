    "answer": "marketing : no a_ . . so this does n't go so fast this way . and when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product huh . and uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . we 've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the i i do n't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the corp corporate help me . the the corporation stands behind the product , okay . so the features i think we got the scroll , we 've got the uh the locator , we 've got the durability , we 've got the dependability , industrial designer : it fell off . marketing : we 've got you know the features that make this a unique product . um user interface : beep beep beep . marketing : the characteristics i talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . uh and the corporation , we 're talking about we 're we 're a new we 're a new company . we 're wanting to make a name for ourself . we 're wanting you to uh find our product so we 're gon na give you a good product at a fair price . one thing i would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? that was something i would be interested in . um so yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , i believe , to make it marketable i believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty euros . we 're gon na be competitive , and we 're gon na we 're gon na have a market niche . um w project manager : do you would you a argue that that we 're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? marketing : that that would be uh that would be i think a decision best made by corporate um i i m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , i th i think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense ."
