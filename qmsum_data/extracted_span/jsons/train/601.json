    "answer": "grad a : and then see what kinds of improvements i get . and so this would be a useful thing , um , to know in terms of , like , which which , um which of these categories are are good for , um , speech recognition . phd f : hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : so , that 's i hope to get those , uh those experiments done by by the time quals come come around in july . phd f : so do you just take the probabilities of the other ones and spread them out evenly among the the remaining ones ? grad a : yeah . i i i was thinking ok , so just set to set to some really low number , the the non - voiced , um , phones . phd f : mm - hmm . grad a : right ? and then renormalize . right . yeah . phd d : mm - hmm . phd f : cool . that will be really interesting to see , you know . so then you 're gon na feed the those into some standard recognizer . grad a : mm - hmm . phd f : uh , wh are you gon na do digits grad a : yeah , m um , well , i 'm gon na f work with timit phd f : or ? with timit . ok . grad a : timit uh , phone recognition with timit . phd f : mm - hmm . grad a : and , um phd f : oh , so then you 'll feed those sorry . so where do the outputs of the net go into if you 're doing phone recognition ? grad a : oh . um , the outputs of the net go into the standard , h um , icsi hybrid , um , recognizer . so maybe , um , chronos"
