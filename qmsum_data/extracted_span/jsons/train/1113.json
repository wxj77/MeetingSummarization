    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss at the end of the meeting when summarizing the whole meeting ?",
    "answer": "project manager : um each time i uh i had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . uh so that can be uh can be read out . uh a f a few things i uh i noticed uh were um moment . ooh . uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is i think uh how uh it 's going to look uh with uh we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they do n't uh you do n't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wan na use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television . i think that 's the point what uh user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : we discussed . marketing : yeah , yeah , some of them . the menus uh are not identical for all th for all tvs , so you have to display it on one uh tv . user interface : well you can use um when you uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the tv , marketing : yeah , but that 's not possible . user interface : then there 's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume marketing : mm-hmm , mm yeah . user interface : and um well maybe we can look out if there 's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda tv it is , from ah , it 's a philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t project manager : yeah , but you have uh uh an marketing : add th that that 's an opportunity . project manager : yeah , but you have an international market range , so you have i think a big range of user interface : well there are universal d um um remotes project manager : yeah . user interface : and they all have a functionality for all the tvs , uh so this would n't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these . project manager : okay . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but they marketing : but project manager : and it 's not too complex to do it . industrial designer : well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your tv project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and that that is bit of a tricky job . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i actually use one of those when they are they are kinda kinda troublesome , but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , because uh in order for the remote to process something from the tv , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive , user interface : yeah . well yeah . mm-hmm . oh um mo industrial designer : and that 's well marketing : no no no . user interface : no , you can just say uh the c marketing : he he he he me he means just just one other thing . project manager : just build it in . user interface : yeah . marketing : uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press yeah , you have to press a code for tv . industrial designer : yeah . yes . user interface : in codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . you look up , i have a philips h_ fifty five industrial designer : yeah . user interface : and it says press code four five five marketing : yeah . industrial designer : oh , okay , yeah , sure , uh user interface : and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah . user interface : and it displays all your uh menu options . industrial designer : oh , yeah yeah , sure , that would be possible , yeah . marketing : yeah . now we uh just connect uh the tv type uh to a set of options , in just just in the memory , user interface : memory in the in the remote . industrial designer : profiles . marketing : so that if you yeah , like profile , so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of tv uh industrial designer : yeah . marketing : the memory uh pops up the options . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , that would be possible . yeah , sure . project manager : okay . marketing : i th do n't think that 's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables . industrial designer : no , that would n't be uh user interface : yeah , well um industrial designer : yeah , a few variables . user interface : if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds tvs at maximum . if you have all of them , all the old and new tvs summed up , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : so uh i think uh it is possible . industrial designer : ah it is . it is definitely po marketing : but , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new tv that is n't incorporated in the remote project manager : we have five minutes to go . user interface : yeah . well then you have to buy a new one , it 's very good for marketing marketing : new remote ? user interface : maybe , or an update , software update . marketing : a firmware upgrade or something , user interface : firmware update , you say . industrial designer : yeah , firmware upgrade . marketing : but from where ? ah . maybe w industrial designer : that 's maybe the cup holder . marketing : no m may no , user interface : yeah . marketing : maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh u_s_b_ or a firewire connection , so that you can uh connect it to the p_c_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet . industrial designer : well , not everybody has uh has uh a p_c_ at home . well the most most people have , user interface : well , at industrial designer : but not not everybody user interface : uh you can go back to the shop industrial designer : and user interface : and uh they marketing : yeah , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : like a s kind of service centre . user interface : yeah , ser o industrial designer : yeah , maybe something like service cen marketing : yeah . user interface : and they can download it for you . industrial designer : or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection . user interface : yeah . well already digital information is sent t to the the standards , tv uh connections , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : you can see what 's uh programme is on on the new uh channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard tv uh industrial designer : well then then it 's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it 's actually worth it to build it in , user interface : receiving . oh yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we could actually look at into it , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but i dunno , it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it user interface : difficult . yeah . industrial designer : and marketing : i i think it 's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop . user interface : yeah yeah , uh s i think some i think it 's good idea , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , that would be probably best , yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : like when you when you buy a tv you just ask well i 'll marketing : it 's it 's it 's not a lot of work , just one uh docking station where you put it in , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : press start , bling bling , updated . industrial designer : yeah , that would be best , yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah . you do n't buy a tv every week , new teev so . user interface : okay , let 's uh save this in the meanwhile uh industrial designer : no no . exactly , so user interface : um m for which one are we going ? my mistake . marketing : let 's vote . user interface : that one or uh industrial designer : yeah , my vote goes out to the right . user interface : your vote and your marketing : my vote too . project manager : yeah . user interface : okay . industrial designer : marketing : and your vote ?"
