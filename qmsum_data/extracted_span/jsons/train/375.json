    "answer": "marketing : as opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . industrial designer : mm . yeah . marketing : um , so it is something that people care about . it 's not , it 's not ignored in the household . um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : they 're you know thumb-masters . um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . that a very small amount . thought that was interesting . project manager : alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . industrial designer : mm . the single function . project manager : and another thing with um lots of surfing , we 'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : because i find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they 're printed on the button . industrial designer : yeah that 's a good point . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : and actually to go with that , i 'm gon na give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they 're used . and uh how important the uh users find them . so the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . hopefully the person 's not turning on and off the tv . um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . so people wan na be able to turn on the tv with the remote control . um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . industrial designer : marketing : that 's a huge amount . this is the most important button . um , so obviously when commercials come on they 're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that 's not gon na run down . relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . and it 's used on average four times an hour . not as much as channel selection , but still significant . um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . relevance is two . screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . um , and relevance of one point five . we 're getting to specific statistics here . teletext , um , now i 'm not too clear on what that is . i do n't know if you can help me . flipping pages . user interface : it 's um marketing : is that industrial designer : it 's like the news . or like information . user interface : it has tv has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the project manager : it 's um industrial designer : and what 's on . marketing : so like a running banner , underneath project manager : no it 's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up . user interface : no , li yeah . project manager : i have n't used it before user interface : yeah . project manager : but industrial designer : it 's like user interface : and you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it 'll come up . industrial designer : it 's like very basic internet . sort of , marketing : okay . user interface : very basic internet , yeah . industrial designer : um user interface : but you have marketing : okay . like tells you the weather , and user interface : yeah . but you have no interaction back with it , you know . marketing : okay . user interface : like the internet you can send emails and you 've no interaction . industrial designer : yeah , it 's just information that um , like television timetables , what 's on , what 's on now , what 's on next , on every channel , and marketing : right . user interface : yeah . marketing : alright . well i guess i 'm not with it , because i was n't but it 's , it 's being used fourteen times an hour . um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . so it looks like something that we 're gon na want to do some research on and include on our remote control . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um , channel settings . zero point zero one times an hour . relevance of three . channel settings . user interface : uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? marketing : p sorry . changing the channels ? user interface : tuning them in at the very start . you know if you get a new tv set , you tune in all the channels , industrial designer : to get the right reception and picture , i suppose . user interface : do you th do you think ? marketing : oh , okay . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : yeah . okay . um , so it 's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . okay . um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . remote controls are often lost somewhere . so that was already discussed by poppy . how we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . so it should be very user-friendly , you know . people know what to do very quickly . um , remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ . industrial designer : repetitive strain injury . user interface : repeti uh . industrial designer : i think . marketing : is that what it is ? people with arthritis and such ? project manager : that 's rather sad . industrial designer : user interface : industrial designer : marketing : um , maybe our industrial designer : oh , i 'm guessing that 's what it is . i 'm not"
