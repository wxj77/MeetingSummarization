    "answer": "professor e : i mean , when we did the spam work i mean , there we had we had this notion of an , uh , auditory @ @ { comment } auditory event . grad a : good . that 's great . professor e : and , uh , um , called them `` avents `` , uh , uh , uh , with an a at the front . phd f : mm - hmm . professor e : uh . and the the the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere . so . grad a : mm - hmm . professor e : um . a sudden change or a relatively rapid change in some spectral characteristic will will do sort of this . i mean , there 's certainly a bunch of a bunch of places where you know that neurons are gon na fire because something novel has happened . that was that was the main thing that we were focusing on there . but there 's certainly other things beyond what we talked about there that are n't just sort of rapid changes , but phd f : it 's kinda like the difference between top - down and bottom - up . professor e : yeah . phd f : i think of the acoustic you know , phonetic features as being top - down . you know , you look at the phone and you say this phone is supposed to be you know , have this feature , this feature , and this feature . whether tha those features show up in the acoustic signal is sort of irrelevant . whereas , an acoustic event goes the other way . here 's the signal . here 's some event . grad a : mm - hmm . phd f : what ? and then that you know , that may map to this phone sometimes , and sometimes it may not . it just depen maybe depends on the context , things like that . professor e : mm - hmm . phd f : and so it 's sort of a different way of looking . professor e : mm - hmm . grad a : yeah . so . yeah . mm - hmm . um using these these events , um , you know , we can we can perform these these , uh , cheating experiments . see how how how good they are , um , in , um in terms of phoneme recognition or word recognition . and , um and then from that point on , i would , uh , s design robust event detectors , um , in a similar , um , wa spirit that saul has done w uh , with his graphical models , and this this probabilistic and - or model that he uses . um , eh , try to extend it to , um to account for other other phenomena like , um , cmr co - modulation release . and , um and maybe also investigate ways to to modify the structure of these models , um , in a data - driven way , uh , similar to the way that , uh , jeff jeff , uh , bilmes did his work . um , and while i 'm i 'm doing these , um , event detectors , you know , i can ma mea measure my progress by comparing , um , the error rates in clean and noisy conditions to something like , uh , neural nets . um , and so so , once we have these these , uh , event detectors , um , we could put them together and and feed the outputs of the event detectors into into the sri , um , hmm hmm system , and , um and test it on on switchboard or , um , maybe even aurora stuff . and , that 's pretty much the the big picture of of um , the plan . professor e : by the way , um , there 's , uh , a couple people who are gon na be here i forget if i already told you this , but , a couple people who are gon na be here for six months . grad a : mm - hmm . professor e : uh uh , there 's a professor kollmeier , uh , from germany who 's , uh , uh , quite big in the , uh , hearing - aid signal - processing area and , um , michael kleinschmidt , who 's worked with him , who also looks at auditory properties inspired by various , uh , brain function things . so , um , um , i think they 'll be interesting to talk to , in this sort of issue as these detectors are are , uh , developing ."
