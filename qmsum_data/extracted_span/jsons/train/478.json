    "query": "<s> summarize the whole meeting .",
    "answer": "project manager : okay , all set ? welcome to the conceptual design meeting . user interface : uh , okay . project manager : the agenda . the opening . i 'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . so um , who wants to start off ? technical uh designer again ? user interface : again . project manager : okay . uh , yeah . uh , before we begin it , i want to say i 've i 've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they 're still not uh quite okay . it uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : project manager : so marketing : okay . project manager : but uh , from now on i wo n't use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : user interface : uh , may be better , yeah . marketing : keyboard work . yeah . project manager : i think it will will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes . user interface : yeah . marketing : alright . industrial designer : okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it 's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . we have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls . um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah , it feels uh good in your hand . marketing : industrial designer : mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . uh i 've got a uh email from the possibilities of real reaction . um uh they 're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . mm it 's okay . yeah . i when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . uh um the energy source , uh i 've got a lot of possibilities for that too . um , uh the basic battery , which i thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah , kinetic uh energy . also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and so you do n't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : um uh also the case material , uh i think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird . user interface : oh titanium is probably trendy , i think . . marketing : that 's true , i guess . yeah . user interface : well , maybe a little bit expensive . marketing : user interface : i do n't know . industrial designer : uh , they do n't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium . um the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . mm , i 've told about uh the three first points . mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the led transmitter uh transmitter . uh , it 's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . um , another possibility . i uh yeah , i looked up on was uh the lcd displays . could be uh something special to our uh remote control , and it 's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five euros . project manager : twelve and a half . actually industrial designer : ah yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , production cost . industrial designer : i th i got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one . user interface : industrial designer : you see uh a covers , which can be project manager : what are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so user interface : industrial designer : um , i do n't know . um marketing : project manager : but it 's actually kind of uh user interface : i project manager : well , it resembles the design i had in mind for this proj you know the the cartoonish alessi kind of design . industrial designer : yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh project manager : and we can we can steal their ideas . marketing : industrial designer : maybe a kind of uh whole uh um a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh with a huge variety of uh project manager : well , it 's a possibility , too . industrial designer : uh house uh stuff . user interface : different colours also . industrial designer : like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style , but project manager : uh-uh . marketing : yeah , that 'll be for the future , i guess . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . project manager : next time we 're here . industrial designer : yes , because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it . marketing : yeah . project manager : oh , okay . marketing : yeah . definitely . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . industrial designer : thank you . marketing : alright . user interface : uh marketing : yeah . that 's okay . user interface : well , i shall go to the next slide . um marketing : user interface : um , i still do n't have any information about user requirements . marketing : user interface : i was thinking about just uh the basic functions and i got uh project manager : oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting . did n't we ? user interface : yeah , but but then wh i do n't know when there are new user requirements . project manager : oh , okay . well , tha i did n't receive any new requirements or somethi user interface : i ha i ha i have the i have project manager : just user interface : nothing . project manager : no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only . user interface : well , i have here a couple of basic functions i could think of . project manager : okay . user interface : i dunno if they 're maybe a little bit more , but project manager : well we maybe we can think of that later . w just user interface : yeah . project manager : these are the ones you already summed up in the user interface : yeah , i i uh well , i pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . project manager : okay . user interface : um another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side . um , i do n't know what costs of it . uh , i 've no idea about it . uh , i was also looking for what you said , for i got an email uh uh about uh lcd in in in front of the remote control . i do n't know if that 's a good idea , or maybe it 's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . production . project manager : yeah . user interface : if we got already uh something like a base . industrial designer : uh-huh . project manager : that might get redundant also maybe . i do n't know what kind of information it would user interface : yeah , i do n't know . i d i uh ju i was just thinking about it . then i got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . but marketing : mm yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah , it 's okay . industrial designer : maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control . user interface : the remote control . marketing : then you project manager : user interface : a little uh too a little bit marketing : and then you 've got a flag s very big r_c_ . yeah . project manager : okay . that 's not it was not a good idea . user interface : a little bit too big , i think . exactly . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : okay . user interface : um , yeah . well , the functions are are not more to discuss , i think . project manager : no . no . user interface : it 's it 's just the base things we already discussed that the no v_c_r_ or that kind of uh , so that 's very easy . um project manager : but you do mention the next and previous uh button . user interface : mm-hmm . well , that 's next channel . i mean next channel . marketing : next channel , previous channel . project manager : oh , okay , o okay okay . user interface : uh um oh , i i got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base . so , it 's uh just an idea . and i um uh thinked of the button sizes and i 'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small industrial designer : but you 're the expert . marketing : i think it depends on the function . user interface : well , i 'm not a e i 'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : maybe it marketing : well , if you save uh perhaps uh s tiny buttons are n't user-friendly , then we would n't im implement that of course . project manager : user interface : well uh industrial designer : marketing : user interface : okay , that 's your point . um , yeah . yeah , okay . marketing : user interface : yeah , i 've nothing to s industrial designer : project manager : well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger . marketing : oh , that 's right . user interface : uh , with a little bit larger , yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : i thought so , but maybe with the project manager : well , i think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have yeah , they have to be large . user interface : yeah , that groups . project manager : uh , i mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the to skip channels and to uh user interface : large ? yeah . project manager : i think yeah , i do n't know why , but i think that is that 's t trendy too , user interface : most the most used uh buttons . marketing : those are probably the the th project manager : because that 's the mo it it you know , it 's uh acc acc um accentu uh , how do you say it ? it puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t user interface : true . yeah . marketing : those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control . project manager : yeah . and you want to acc accentuate that , you know . industrial designer : you did the research . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : it 's from your research . marketing : sorry ? yeah , sure . project manager : so user interface : okay . uh , that was all y industrial designer : user interface : uh personal preference i did n't have . project manager : okay . user interface : i did n't had any time left . project manager : no uh , that 's coo it 's cool . industrial designer : marketing : you do n't care . no , sorry . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : yeah . user interface : marketing : oh . go away . user interface : it 's there . marketing : come on . user interface : yeah , click on it . marketing : . user interface : couple time . marketing : oh , great . well , i 've done some research again about trends on the internet . um i 've done some investigation , and uh well i uh got some information from fashion watchers from paris and uh milan . some uh some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . uh , well , we were going to imply that , so that 's nice . the second important thing is uh innovative technology in the r_c_ . uh , our market really likes really likes that . and uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . and uh , well , for the idea , i 've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people . industrial designer : marketing : dark colours , simple recognisable shapes . so we probably wo n't do that . user interface : marketing : the younger market likes uh well , the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . industrial designer : user interface : industrial designer : marketing : i found this image , which is uh well , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables . i do n't see the spongy part in it . but with a little bit of fancy project manager : well maybe c then we have to do something with sponge bob then . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : exactly . i got some ideas user interface : marketing : uh well , yeah , pictures is n't really good word , but um industrial designer : marketing : some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . uh , catchy colours . industrial designer : marketing : fruit is uh yellow , green , red , whatever . user interface : marketing : so , remote controls in in catchy colours . project manager : it does n't stroke with the with the dark colours . marketing : uh , no , we do n't want dark colours . project manager : not the dark colours ? okay . marketing : no , i just put them there to uh , yeah , uh for general idea . project manager : okay . marketing : and uh , the docking st industrial designer : marketing : uh i think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . but to industrial designer : marketing : yeah , the to implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . at the bottom of the docking station or whatever . and uh , we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah industrial designer : marketing : uh uh v how do you say ? project manager : for diversity or something . uh marketing : yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . user interface : well , how uh industrial designer : marketing : i mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it does n't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black r_c_ on the market or whatever . yes . user interface : but how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in christ 's sake with remote control ? industrial designer : project manager : no , but i i i think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . marketing : yeah , there 's there 's always a user interface : uh , make it a banana ? project manager : it 's like a pear or something . user interface : marketing : well there there 's always empty space of course on a remote control . i mean i think this part of the r_c_ uh well the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons , i guess . project manager : no , i do n't think you have to do it like industrial designer : user interface : marketing : so you you can put some fruity things project manager : yeah , but it that does n't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . industrial designer : marketing : no , of course not . project manager : and so y i i think this y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something . marketing : especially i user interface : yeah , but th yeah , but that marketing : yeah , yeah . yeah , exactly . industrial designer : project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , but that 's marketing : if we make it little bit greenish . project manager : you do get the idea , eh ? the fruity kind of round user interface : yeah uh uh project manager : 'kay . marketing : a and we could use one of these for the uh w what is it ? project manager : yeah , uh yeah , i do n't know . industrial designer : grapes . marketing : uh industrial designer : project manager : uh , this is a b yeah . marketing : is n't wha whatever . user interface : but d do n't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ? industrial designer : project manager : yeah , yeah . of course we have uh marketing : yeah , sure . project manager : we have a very big uh the s marketing : yeah . well , w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . industrial designer : for a big team of artists . project manager : of d design team , yeah . user interface : marketing : this is then the uh pear . i do n't know the english word , so forget it . project manager : yeah , but it 's pear , i guess . marketing : and um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control , but m yeah . industrial designer : but uh but i think we do n't have to make project manager : no . industrial designer : we ca n't make all uh ten designs . we have to make one design i th i i think . project manager : no , but i think it 's it 's already what we were were up to . marketing : mayb maybe two or three . user interface : yeah . project manager : uh , it 's it does n't have to resemble uh what i already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on . marketing : yeah . no sure , but but project manager : and it 's it looks fruity to me . user interface : marketing : b but that 's great , and and and what i was project manager : and uh , but i do like the marketing : what what i was saying , the catchy colours project manager : yeah , i do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because i do i think a dark colour would be nice too . industrial designer : but pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables marketing : yeah . project manager : maybe it 's too much , you know . user interface : but , we we have to um there have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . marketing : yeah , uh not really . pictures was a was a bad word , but project manager : okay , but what are the this is yellow . marketing : well we c yeah . user interface : yellow , a real reaction . industrial designer : yes , you can put a logo on top of it . project manager : but i do n't think our our company colours are this fashionable . marketing : yeah , sure . user interface : uh , yeah . marketing : maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here . user interface : we uh f industrial designer : yes , it 's really fruity . marketing : i ca n't draw with this thing , but i 'll try . user interface : a yellow do marketing : if this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . user interface : uh , yeah . marketing : it does n't work . and then user interface : yeah , and the button then . industrial designer : with a strawberry on top . project manager : yeah , on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do marketing : well , the button button over here or whatever , user interface : okay , yeah . marketing : i do n't know . on the front , of course , because else you ca n't find it . user interface : okay . marketing : well , that were my ideas a little bit . project manager : okay . marketing : i 'll close 'em down . um , go away . project manager : okay , you can you open the conceptual design presentation ? marketing : conceptual design , yes . project manager : see what was on the agenda . user interface : lazy . marketing : the agenda . project manager : this is his own remote . because um , maybe we can start with the technical uh functions , user interface : yeah . project manager : but i do n't think it 's there uh , yeah um , do we want to um use an lcd display , for example ? marketing : well , it 's nice , of course . but i do n't i do n't know what to display on it . industrial designer : only if we project manager : me neither . industrial designer : maybe maybe we can make a tv guide on it , for the channel you 're on . marketing : i mean project manager : yeah , but it 's so marketing : yeah , but it should be li like this big , and i do n't think industrial designer : no , no , only the tv channel with the with uh with uh four programmes . project manager : i do n't think we should do it . industrial designer : you can uh zap through them with the page up page down button . marketing : yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large lcd screen , because industrial designer : yes , it can on your no , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . so why not on your remote ? project manager : yeah , but no . i do i think it 's a bit redundant , actually . marketing : yeah , i do n't know . project manager : and it 's also not i do n't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , user interface : well well what would you display on it then ? project manager : it 's industrial designer : uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide marketing : programme information . user interface : but is it is n't that a already on tv , a lot of new tvs ? marketing : but industrial designer : on t on teletext , yes . also on the internet . marketing : well a lot a lot of tvs indeed show uh when you uh zap to a industrial designer : but project manager : but you 're already watching the tv , you 're not gon na watch your remote control . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yes , but you also want to know what 's next . marketing : but then we also uh w need to bring out a line of tvs which we were planning to , user interface : yeah , project manager : user interface : and we also have to yeah . marketing : but whatever . because the tv has to send information back to the r_c_ , and i do n't know if that 's possible . industrial designer : yes , that 's uh really possible . project manager : marketing : yes , yes , o of course it 's possible , user interface : marketing : but you got ta uh implement it in the tvs , and i do n't think everyone 's gon na buy a real reaction tv within a month after the release of our uh remote control . industrial designer : project manager : i really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an lcd in it , user interface : and i also industrial designer : user interface : marketing : project manager : but i i really do n't think it 's a good n goo because it also does n't stroke with we wanted uh c when we talk about the materials , uh it 's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . it was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . marketing : yeah . project manager : but i do n't think a lcd display fits in that image . you know , it 's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know . marketing : that 's true , that 's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it 's not very solid , it 's uh frag fragile . project manager : yeah , yeah . you could make it , but it 's just it it does n't i do n't think it it 's coherent with the design we 're after . marketing : no . no . i do n't think so ei either . project manager : but that 's my opinion . well , you you y okay , we can vote for it . you want the lcd display . i do n't want to and he does n't , so it 's up to him . industrial designer : no . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : if we wan na user interface : yeah , i dunno . marketing : . ah . industrial designer : project manager : and i 've read somewhere that i 've got some kind of veto veto uh rights . user interface : . oh , okay . industrial designer : marketing : bastard . project manager : so i can also say user interface : we can you away . project manager : but did we skip the yeah , you could do marketing : project manager : m but what what i so what i but do you think we should user interface : yeah , i do n't know . uh , uh i i if it 's it 's a simple p project manager : we 're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . so user interface : no , that that 's right , industrial designer : no uh um user interface : and uh i also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . kind of lcd or something or industrial designer : y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions . marketing : yeah , i guess . user interface : but how does it display then ? w when i go to the second channel , what what does it show me ? industrial designer : uh , then you push a button . the title and the information about the programme . user interface : about that programme ? industrial designer : but but uh yeah , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be uh customised to the project manager : nah , that 's not gon na work . industrial designer : but maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first project manager : yeah . oh , well uh i 've seen it done before . industrial designer : you have the biggest uh project manager : do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d lcd displays , user interface : yeah . project manager : but then it 's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling . so it 's that that 's what i 've seen . industrial designer : yes , you can put uh a little lcd display on it with uh with lots of information . marketing : yeah , that 's true , if you uh yeah . project manager : but it just it j it does n't does n't match with the our whole basic concept . industrial designer : but uh i have n't thought about it . but whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh uh screen on top of it , it i it is n't vulnerable . project manager : well yeah , yeah , okay . that 's maybe not the most important , industrial designer : you can throw with it and project manager : but it 's just user interface : is it fashion ? project manager : i do n't think so . industrial designer : when when you put uh maybe a colour lcd t uh screen on it , it 's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from user interface : i do n't know . that 's not up to you . that 's up to market if i if it 's trendy . project manager : yeah , well do you ha do you have to you have n't looked after the trendiness of lcd displays , have you ? marketing : no . industrial designer : user interface : because our our motto is we put fashion marketing : well , i think it 's uh i think it 's pretty trendy , to be honest , uh but um i do n't know if if if well , i 'm coming back to the costs again , but i think uh we got ta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . and i think uh especially colour lcd , which is indeed pretty trendy . but i do n't think uh , i think it will be too expensive . industrial designer : but uh i 've got a the email with uh with the possibilities . and lcd was a possibility for the remote control . project manager : user interface : project manager : yeah yeah yeah . industrial designer : so why do n't we use it . project manager : yeah , but we 're gon na if it marketing : uh , did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh lcd or uh coloured lcd ? user interface : yeah , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . coloured marketing : yeah really , user interface : if you have black and white or something , or grey , that 's marketing : if y if you c i project manager : then uh then you better do n't yeah , d marketing : i in in two thousand and four you ca n't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme . project manager : user interface : marketing : really . industrial designer : no , but it does n't sa say anything about a colour or but , mm , i alf i also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it . but project manager : uh uh i really do n't feel the whole idea of an lcd display . industrial designer : i did n't think that project manager : i 'm sorry . it ca n't co you can not convince me . i do n't know how well how to with you guys , but i do n't really feel it . we already we 're uh user interface : it 's too much uh maybe uh with with the lcd and the docking station and project manager : yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets , marketing : yeah . project manager : and want and it uh uh , do it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft industrial designer : yes , but o on the marketing : w we 've we 've got ta find a balance , of course . user interface : with one thing special . marketing : and i think user interface : not a whole package of specialty . project manager : i do n't think i j uh , and really , i do n't see how the the lcd display is gon na add anything , you know , on a design level . uh , i think it 's slicker to have no l_ ceds . industrial designer : no , when y project manager : y we want to it 's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you do n't need an lcd . industrial designer : but it look yes , but that remote controls are already on the market . the simple project manager : it does n't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote . industrial designer : yes , but but when you want to have something special project manager : yeah , but we already have the docking station , which is industrial designer : yes , but you had a picture of it from another company . user interface : and uh the marketing : we have a pear . project manager : it has to be developed , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : but no , but it that 's industrial designer : project manager : that 's our that 's our killer feature . user interface : it 's just an it 's just an idea . marketing : project manager : that 's our what makes it special . user interface : it 's a it 's industrial designer : yes , it was already made . tha the remote control on the docking station . project manager : yeah , we 're gon na develop our own r n docking station . user interface : true . marketing : is that so ? was it it was n't just a prototype ? user interface : well uh i uh industrial designer : yes , he have a picture of it . project manager : user interface : yeah , i dunno . industrial designer : marketing : exactly , i 've never seen it in a store . project manager : uh , but re we really have to cut this off , user interface : project manager : i re i know you i i i i i get the idea you really like it , you know , the the lcd thing , but i i think it 's it 's not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments . i do n't uh , do you guys agre how do you guys think ? i d user interface : no , it 's too much . marketing : i think it 's a little too much , yeah . user interface : it 's overdone . project manager : okay , we s skip the lcd display . user interface : industrial designer : okay . marketing : okay . project manager : i 'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something . user interface : democratically . industrial designer : marketing : no . user interface : industrial designer : mayb marketing : . project manager : but industrial designer : i will rule the world with it . project manager : probably so . marketing : yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager : okay . but for the technical part . the m material , i think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . uh industrial designer : yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is project manager : yeah yeah yeah , p exactly . this is what it w yeah , but it it was already what we 're uh we 're after , you know , to give it uh , you know , the soft touch in your hands marketing : yeah , for the spongy uh feel . yeah . user interface : with a spongy bob feel . project manager : and also to , know , like user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing . industrial designer : like a b yes . project manager : you can st throw it at your little brother 's head . user interface : yeah , you just can drop it . yeah . marketing : yeah , airbag . if you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , yeah . project manager : yeah . no no no , not that comfy . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : maybe it marketing : industrial designer : but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see . project manager : yeah yeah . yeah . okay , that 's a that 's a good point . and that 's why i like the dark t col dark colour bit , you know , because it may be the design uh , it 's uh maybe it is a bit of the marketing : yeah . user interface : but not black i think . project manager : it 's a bit nineties maybe , what we 're what we 're up to rat fun to this point . user interface : well if if it 's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful . project manager : yeah , that 's that 's true , but but it has to be a little big solid . marketing : yeah , b yeah , that 's what w i i was pointing at .

but , i project manager : okay , but what uh , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ? user interface : project manager : industrial designer : uh fronts of the we can have uh different uh uh fronts of the project manager : should we do that ? industrial designer : telephone . project manager : i do n't think you we should do that . maybe just bring it out in different colours , user interface : different fronts . project manager : but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that 's also too much . marketing : yeah . i guess that 's that 's enough . project manager : people do n't wan na spend more money on their remote control , i guess . marketing : that 's way too nokia . user interface : yeah . uh , you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants , yeah . industrial designer : are these designs ? project manager : yeah , yeah . marketing : yeah , definitely . just bring more designs on the market . user interface : yeah , three three or four uh four uh colours , or something like that . project manager : but uh , without gon uh marketing : why not , yeah . project manager : okay . so , are we through the technical part then

so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ? industrial designer : mm marketing : sure . project manager : makes it in a homogeneous uh design . user interface : no , not all , not all of them . industrial designer : but it it then it uh you ca n't throw it it . it will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff project manager : it will it will break other stuff w when it 's plastic , as well . industrial designer : when you throw with uh titanium with your remote control . user interface : industrial designer : no uh , marketing : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : titanium is a bit uh it 's a bit harder . marketing : yeah , that 's true . project manager : no , but uh uh , you should ma yeah . industrial designer : but also on the colours , the young project manager : okay

nowadays is way more often used than plastic . industrial designer : yes , but a titanium remote control , when you 're uh watching tv uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the user interface : in trendy things . marketing : yeah , o on the other hand , if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh user interface : yeah . it 's cold in the winter . project manager : yeah , but i i really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing . industrial designer : yes . project manager : but the question is i then it 's , you know , is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh , know , like uh user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , that 's true , that 's true . industrial designer : sports and gaming . define project manager : when you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually do n't need . and when it 's big and plastic , it 's like some fun stuff you can always have around . it 's always fun to have something big and plastic around . user interface : you have that uh m_p_ three player of nike , i saw . marketing : yes . yeah . user interface : is n't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ? industrial designer : yes , it 's w but it is uh plastic . user interface : is n't it is plastic ? well , it 's titanium looking . industrial designer : yes , w we can do that on the on the marketing : what ? user interface : yeah , he is . here he is . uh , the i do n't know if you know the m_p_ three player of nike . 'kay , uh that that 's very uh with rubber , so it 's very marketing : oh , yeah . okay , yeah . project manager : yeah , that 's beautiful . marketing : yeah , i see . industrial designer : we can make this as a style too . marketing : yeah , but but but user interface : rough . industrial designer : uh , this is uh just a project manager : oh , maybe th maybe this is an marketing : yeah , i th i think that 's difficult , because uh that 's different material , and then you got ta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of industrial designer : no , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic . marketing : yeah , if it 's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then , i guess it 's it 's nice to have one of these . project manager : no , i do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it . industrial designer : uh marketing : uh project manager : you know , like the the soft stuff , marketing : yeah . project manager : but i do n't know if it 's possible . industrial designer : i do n't have the information . uh , i i did n't got it project manager : but you ca n't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look . user interface : true . project manager : but make it just like shiny . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah yeah , true . project manager : maybe we should uh shou industrial designer : like the m_p_ three player . user interface : yeah , maybe that 's good idea , yeah . but if you want to la uh yeah , last longer than two weeks or something like that , you can maybe marketing : yeah . project manager : and uh and marketing : project manager : maybe we sh should we t i do n't know if we should talk about uh , how how much time have we got left ? industrial designer : uh , in a lot of other uh user interface : i do n't know . project manager : forty minutes . user interface : what time does industrial designer : in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry . uh , they began with uh t typical uh leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon of uh of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : like eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and project manager : you putting in different colours . industrial designer : yes , and and styles . project manager : okay . industrial designer : they have uh also uh a kind of uh um uh roses on it , a and uh marketing : uh yeah , yeah . project manager : okay . yeah , but w yeah . user interface : project manager : well , it is . it 's a possibility . but , let 's think about the bas industrial designer : then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new uh with new colours , new marketing : yes . new prints on it . yep . project manager : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . but wha th our basic idea y i mean , you gon na we 're probably gon na have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . and and pro and lights . we have to incorporate the lights too . but , uh do w gon na gon na are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? is that the idea ? is that a good idea ? marketing : how do you mean ? th th the uh base in a in another project manager : how many colours are we how many colours are we gon na we 're uh uh f uh f user interface : the rubber . project manager : only five minutes left , by the way . how many colours are we gon na give it ? like two-tone colour ? t industrial designer : there there are three uh components three components type . user interface : yeah . uh no , not too much i think . industrial designer : you have the buttons , the the case uh itself , and the rubber and th marketing : how the buttons yeah . project manager : i think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , and the cushions as well should be in another colour . user interface : or you just make uh one colour , uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , but not more than user interface : in in another colour . project manager : well , yeah , it 's user interface : not more than two colours i think . it 's a g a little bit too flashy . marketing : no , definitely not . project manager : maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting . industrial designer : yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as well uh marketing : yes , definitely . project manager : okay . but we have to uh think of some other uh important things . industrial designer : project manager : uh oh yeah , the the functionalities of the the buttons . user interface : the funct yeah , i was i was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea . project manager : no . marketing : no , i think that 's too vulnerable . project manager : i think this is okay , user interface : yeah . project manager : the so we have the basic . then we have the numbers . we have the power button . we have we have a teletext button . user interface : the volume , teletext and project manager : and maybe want to access a a menu or something . most tvs have a menu . marketing : yeah , but that 's that 's i was thinking that 's got ta be on the television . user interface : project manager : yeah , but i think you ha i really need a menu button . user interface : yeah yeah yeah yeah , b project manager : that 's just i the only button only user interface : yeah , but wha what kind of menu ? project manager : you know , i user interface : is uh is n't that different from every television ? project manager : no , i think most tvs have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings . and so marketing : mm . yeah , if it 's c if yeah , i think it 's okay to to add a menu button for uh user interface : project manager : but that that covers all the all the other settings . it covers everything then . marketing : and if the tv does n't have a menu , then industrial designer : but then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right marketing : yeah . project manager : no , you can use the marketing : yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever . project manager : and you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . industrial designer : okay . project manager : th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem marketing : mm , yeah . a mute and a teletext and a menu . project manager : uh yeah , mute . a teletext and a menu , and then then i that 's it . user interface : mute . project manager : it 's all we need . marketing : that 's all . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay , uh another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station . marketing : great . yeah . user interface : okay , that 's not mu not much functions . so project manager : something important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself , i guess . marketing : yeah , definitely . project manager : uh , in one colour . marketing : are we gon na do something with the uh spongy thing there ? project manager : just use i think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side . industrial designer : uh marketing : yeah , that 's true , that 's true . project manager : and we will make it spongy and and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did i think this is kind of fruity , you know . just round shapes with uh user interface : marketing : yeah , it 's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w project manager : yeah , but we 're gon na have to we really have to think i think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but and but it d it does n't have to be annoying , that when you uh , know , some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you it just gets annoying , because it 's so big and flashy . marketing : yeah , definitely . project manager : uh , it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to still have to think of how we manage to uh to get to that . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . guess we 're through then . marketing : okay . user interface : okay . marketing : i guess so . project manager : but we i think also we just so we have to do something with colour but also , i i think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . i think that 's uh adds to the user interface : yeah . project manager : too much colour maybe m um user interface : too much colour , i it uh when you got it in a living room , it 's too much maybe project manager : but our des design experts will uh work that out . marketing : yea yeah . user interface : . it has to be project manager : okay , well i think the meeting will be over within a minute . user interface : yeah . project manager : so we will wrap up . marketing : something like that . project manager : or is there anything we 'd like to discuss ?
