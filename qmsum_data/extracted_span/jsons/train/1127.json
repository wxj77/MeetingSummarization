    "query": "<s> what did the meeting talk about the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals ?",
    "answer": "michelle brown am : thank you , chair . you 've observed that the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those who are n't on free school meals has n't closed significantly at any stage of learning . is the pdg actually working ? meilyr rowlands : well , i 'm in danger of repeating myself now . it 's quite difficult to identify the cause and the effect in terms of the pdg . so , where there have been improvements , it 's quite difficult to say , 'well , that 's definitely down to the pdg ' , and similarly vice versa : if it 's not working , it 's difficult to say that it 's because of pdg not being used properly . to come back to something else i said previously , there have been small improvements . whether you say that that is due to pdg or not is quite difficult , but there have been some improvements . but there has n't been a major step change in closing that gap , that is true , and i think the conclusion that i draw is that these are major societal challenges and barriers that these young people face . schools can do a certain amount , and of course they must do a certain amount , but to have a step change you do need to engage with the learners , with the parents and with the community and that 's why the more successful schools do actually succeed\u2014it 's because they do that . so , i think more of a push on that area at a national level would be welcome . michelle brown am : in most successful schools , how much is the attainment gap being narrowed , in the schools that make the most effective use of pdg ? meilyr rowlands : well , that would vary from school to school . we can look up specific examples for you of specific schools if you like . john griffiths am : yes , perhaps you could provide a note to the committee on that . meilyr rowlands : yes , i could have a list of schools and how much they 've closed , perhaps . michelle brown am : okay , i 'll move on . john griffiths am : perhaps you could include in that what you would consider to be a significant increase . meilyr rowlands : okay . fine . michelle brown am : thank you . in 2017 , we saw a re-widening of the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals . what effect do you think the welsh government 's changes to performance measures have had in terms of impact ? meilyr rowlands : yes , they definitely had a direct impact on it , and probably there might well be an indirect , longer-term impact as well . but , clearly , changing the performance indicators had a direct , immediate effect , because some of those examinations , qualifications , courses that were typically followed by this cohort of students were n't any longer part of the headline performance indicators . so , you 've all heard about btec science and the key skills qualifications . those sorts of things that many of these pupils used to succeed at , and therefore get the performance indicator for the school , no longer count . so , it 's had a direct impact , and it 's one of the reasons why it 's quite difficult to compare the results of one year and another , because of these changes in performance indicators . michelle brown am : yes , that makes sense . do you think there has n't been any\u2014 ? can we take it from what you 've said that there 's been a positive improvement , or has it been negative ? meilyr rowlands : i think there 's a growing realisation that secondary schools , key stage 4 , is driven overly by performance indicators , and , whatever performance indicator you come up with , there will be unintended consequences . so , it 's not , i think , useful to keep changing the performance indicators and think that you will get to a point where you solve the problem . that 's not likely to happen . what needs to be done is to have a different approach to accountability that does n't put so much attention on these performance indicators , because what you 're doing is you 're just moving the problem around by changing the performance indicators . some of these vocational courses that i mentioned are a good example of this . so , i think the previous performance indicators encouraged schools to enter , for example , whole cohorts to do btec science , and that 's not a good idea because the gcse sciences are better preparation to go on to a-level science , for example . so , you 're cutting out the possibility of progression for those pupils . on the other hand , by discouraging\u2014the new performance indicators discourage btec and now people are saying , 'we 're not offering btec at all ' , and it is suitable for a certain cohort of pupils . so , it 's very difficult to get the performance indicators absolutely right if you put so much pressure on schools to actually achieve those performance indicators . john griffiths am : michelle , i 'd just like to bring in darren at this point . darren millar am : i share some of your concern around the unavailability now of btec in some schools . it strikes me that the decision to discourage the availability of btec , which is what the performance measures do , really is sending a message about vocational qualifications that is not helpful , actually , to many young people for whom vocational qualifications may be perfectly suitable . is that something with which you concur ?"
