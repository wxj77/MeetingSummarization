    "answer": "industrial designer : well that does n't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . um so , somehow that thing 's too big , but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . they say they could put it to work but um we do n't think so . user interface : no . industrial designer : no . it it it you 'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and user interface : if the tv is working , yeah . project manager : user interface : that 's just i mean it 'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it 's gon na change the channel . industrial designer : yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , user interface : so industrial designer : and i think that 's one of the things we wan na keep . project manager : but what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? so if you pressed it and went , up ? industrial designer : that kinda would r d user interface : well then why do n't you just press the up button ? project manager : man yeah . industrial designer : yeah . that would kind of lose it . project manager : but if it 's just one thing with a button that you can just go up . user interface : even still there 's gon na be interf th there 's there still will be interference from the tv . marketing : that 's right . project manager : yeah , okay . user interface : it might not be it might not be completely confusing , but i think you 'll still y it 's still marketing : user interface : i do n't think it 's practical at all . i think it 's a bad idea frankly . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah so um taking that away , our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable project manager : you guys know your stuff . industrial designer : it 's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls . um as for the point that we making about losing it . well , we wan na small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed , but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost , marketing : so ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? you understand what i 'm saying ? user interface : i think i know what you might be getting at , or or project manager : oh i see so if maybe if we had an lcd up the top that just did a number on it , right ? and then it that basically marketing : oh no we could read it from the television . user interface : well , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , project manager : mm . well that 's quite cool . user interface : and it c it project manager : you 'd need a display on the th the thing . user interface : why ? it 'll tell you when you flip the channel on the tv . marketing : yeah the the television can tell you . user interface : yeah . project manager : oh yeah yeah no i see what you 're talking about . yeah that 's kinda cool . how would you program it though ? user interface : well you just it 's one extra button . you say programme start , and then type in marketing : put user interface : 'cause you still have the typing you know you 'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually . project manager : okay okay . user interface : so programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end . project manager : okay and yeah marketing : and then . project manager : and that just basically flips between it and it 'll go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again . user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : yeah that 's kinda cool . i like that . marketing : and again we have another another great marketing tool . we have about three we have three or four things here . project manager : that 's not gon na be too expensive because that 's gon na be you 're gon na be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . you could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology . this may be something that 's available through our own uh through our own services . project manager : might be , but tha that 's not gon na be such a costly feature . the problem we 're gon na have is making it robust . making it last . user interface : oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two . marketing : or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other . project manager : so if there 's a button for each type . user interface : no because you wan na be able to go up and down through the channels . project manager : yeah people are gon na have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they marketing : ah-ha okay . okay , okay , user interface : right . marketing : well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch . project manager : yeah yeah the mode switch . user interface : i think we 'll need a we 'll need a mode switch , but then if we have a mode switch we 're gon na need some kinda indicator project manager : just the lights behind the buttons . user interface : to which , an l_e_ an l_e_d_ project manager : you could have back-lit buttons maybe . user interface : okay . project manager : would that work ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : is that user interface : okay . project manager : okay we have five minutes . so right details th that we 've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel . marketing :"
