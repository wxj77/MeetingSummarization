    "answer": "industrial designer : open . project manager : uh , okay , okay . marketing : there we go . okay well i think we have introduced ourselves , industrial designer : and then full screen . marketing : so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why do n't we pass right to the second slide . cause that 's where m my discussion starts . right well um since i 'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : um i thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason i just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions . you know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your c_d_ whatever you want it to do industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : um and then as we go on what we 'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility . so i 'll be coming to you um frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it 's gon na be to add a feature or how expensive it 's gon na be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it 's just something we ca n't do . industrial designer : mm-hmm . yeah . yeah . yeah . hmm hmm . mm . marketing : so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and then just weed things out that ca n't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we 'll try to then prioritise those . industrial designer : mm-hmm . yeah . marketing : so that was um what i meant there , and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gon na be as important as money , because if we 're gon na sell this thing , i think the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . twenty five euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it 's , gee i just got ta have that . and take out their wallet and buy it . so it 's got ta be really attractive and it but it 's got ta go to market by september , 'cause anything that you do n't already have out there in september showing it around , is n't gon na sell for christmas . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um and then i 'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour user interface : okay . marketing : and i 'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . user interface : okay . marketing : so i 'll be coming to you for how much is it gon na cost us and how long is it gon na take you , industrial designer : mm mm-hmm . marketing : and i 'll be coming to you to tell me what 's gon na make somebody take out their wallet you know , user interface : what features . marketing : what what 's what 's gon na really be what they call a sizzle , user interface : s sellable . yes . marketing : 'cause we got ta sell this sizzle . industrial designer : marketing : a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is n't the thing that somebody 's really just gon na take out their wallet and buy for christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever . okay can we go to the next slide please ? alright i i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we 're looking at the uh the whole house idea really is n't gon na be possible . so i 'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we we could suggest anything . industrial designer : so i i just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um i think these are the very simple features and uh they do n't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also , marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : it 's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they 'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it 's this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . and there should be a child lock , like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they ca n't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they 'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . if make it useable for more than one device it 's a it 's hard but i think it 's possible project manager : yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that 's that 's unfortunately a moot point now . mm-hmm . industrial designer : but it uh marketing : well we already eliminated that . industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah user interface : eliminated . industrial designer : so it 's it 's okay , yeah , yeah . and uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands and uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it i i do n't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit i think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it 's marketing : yeah , that 's that 's a good that 's a good one , project manager : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . user interface : mm yeah . industrial designer : yeah , and we display a clock . marketing : because the clock would be really friendly , and and when is your favourite show coming on industrial designer : yeah . yeah , and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so project manager : yeah you 're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh user interface : yes . marketing : and yeah , and a lot of time there 's not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wan na look at the news for a minute . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah that 's that 's good , the clock is good . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight p_m_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and i do n't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote . industrial designer : yeah , sure . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock . marketing : and an alarm clock , yeah that should that should be okay ."
