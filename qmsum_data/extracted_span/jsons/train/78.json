    "answer": "hefin david am : i 'd like to consider the work of the consortia . in 2016 , your election manifesto very clearly said that you wanted to abolish regional consortia\u2014three words in it . why have n't you done it ? kirsty williams am : because , given that you 're such a keen student of my manifesto , you 'll also know that\u2014 hefin david am : it was only three words . kirsty williams am : the liberal democrat manifesto also said that we supported major local government reform and a major reduction in the number of local government units . that has n't happened . i have to say genuinely , my experience over the last four years has proven to me the value of regional working , and in the absence of significant local government reform , i think it 's absolutely vital that we have scale in school improvement services\u2014scale that i do n't think can be delivered across 22 individual local authorities . hefin david am : okay . so , if there was local government reform , you would abolish the consortia . kirsty williams am : i think if there was significant local government reform and we could demonstrate that those units had such a scale that they could perform the functions of regional consortia , then i think it would be inevitable that any education minister would look to see whether there was an opportunity to change structures . but in the absence of that , hefin , i have been absolutely convinced whilst doing this job that you need larger units to be able to carry out successful school improvement work , and i think it would be reckless to advocate the system going back to school improvement being organised in 22 different ways . hefin david am : okay . do you think that the work of the four consortia has been consistent and effective ? kirsty williams am : the school improvement services ? hefin david am : the four consortia . kirsty williams am : i think , as with individual local education authorities , there are some regional consortia services that have performed really highly\u2014and that 's not me saying that , that 's estyn , but gives us assurance around that\u2014and there are others that need to improve . i think the consortia themselves would admit that they , since their establishment , have found new ways of working . initially , they were very separate entities that did things their own way . increasingly , over recent years , we have seen those consortia working together on a national approach , but delivered on a regional basis . so i think they themselves have evolved over time . but we are constantly looking for optimum delivery from those particular organisations , but as i said , i think it would be absolutely reckless to go back to a situation where school improvement services were being delivered individually on 22 different bases . hefin david am : okay . i 'm happy to accept that you 've changed your opinion there ; that 's no problem at all . but with regard to the four consortia , and we 'll take education through regional working as an example , it does things differently to the other three . is that a cause for concern , or do you think that 's entirely appropriate ? kirsty williams am : well , erw does things differently , but then so does the education achievement service . eas is constituted in a different way to the central south consortium . what i 'm interested in is not necessarily how they are constituted and organised , i 'm interested in the effectiveness of that organisation to deliver for children and for teachers . erw has got particular challenges , and we continue to work with those in erw to address those , but increasingly , as i said , what we are seeing the regional consortia do is develop a national approach to school improvement services but deliver that on a regional basis so that there is greater consistency in terms of delivery . hefin david am : are you happy that , within the erw area , local authorities employ their own improvement advisers , rather than doing it in the way that the others do ? kirsty williams am : we have discussed this at length with them . my preference would be for school improvement officers to be employed in the centre , and we continue to have those discussions , but what 's really important to understand is that the regional consortia are not a beast of the government ; they are a beast of the local authorities that have worked together to create a school improvement service that meets their needs . so we ca n't impose that solution , and we continue to discuss with erw what is the optimal way , and they continue to discuss with their constituent local authorities about how that should be organised . hefin david am : are you concerned that neath port talbot have given notice that they want to withdraw from regional working ? kirsty williams am : i think it 's really disappointing that neath port talbot have published that notice . what 's important for me is to understand\u2014not for me , it will be important for estyn . it will be really important for us to understand how neath port talbot intend to support their schools and their teachers if they were to withdraw from erw , especially at what is a very , very critical time . the regional consortia have a key role to play in supporting systems with the introduction of the curriculum . i would want to know from neath port talbot how they are going to do that without being part of that organisation . and , of course , there 's the added complexity that so much of our money is channelled through to schools via the regional consortia . so , i would want to understand from neath port talbot how they 're going to safeguard their schools and make sure that the children who are receiving their education in neath port talbot are not disadvantaged if they were to follow through on that decision . hefin david am : do you feel that it 's your role to intervene in that area and instruct neath port talbot and erw as to how they should resolve this issue ? kirsty williams am : well , as i said , i would be seeking assurances\u2014 hefin david am : what does that mean , though , 'seeking assurances ' ? kirsty williams am : well , neath port talbot would need to demonstrate to me how they 're going to address these issues . if they 're not part of erw and their schools and their children are not going to be in receipt of the support from erw , as i said , especially at this critical time , how are they intending to do that ? i have n't seen those plans , but if they were to push forward and follow through on the notice , i would want to see them and i suspect estyn would want to see them also . hefin david am : okay , just last issue on that : you 're just waiting to see what neath port talbot do next , then . kirsty williams am : well , we have written to neath port talbot to ask them to demonstrate to us , if they were to pull out of erw , how they 're going to meet their functions . i have not heard back from them . hefin david am : steve , did you want to say something ? steve davies : obviously\u2014 [ inaudible . ] \u2014that point . we wrote to them last friday , and we are awaiting their response now ."
