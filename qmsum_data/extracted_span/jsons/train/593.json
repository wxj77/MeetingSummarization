    "query": "<s> what was the decision of the discussion about button design ?",
    "answer": "project manager : no , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? there are other ways too . just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or user interface : yeah . mm-hmm . yeah . marketing : that 's true but um i do n't think there are many tvs that can switch channels that fast . and so you would need like the tv would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . and i dunno if many channels would do have that . if many tvs have that . industrial designer : yeah . and besides that it 's um if we 're gon na focus on elderly people they 'll have to adapt . they 're not used to using scroll buttons . project manager : that 's right . industrial designer : so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : the numbers yeah . yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it 's too much we can uh reconsider it . but i think there wo n't be very much buttons . user interface : yeah . project manager : or there do n't have to be a lot . marketing : but i do n't think i think if you 're gon na make a remote control only to operate a tv , you there 's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 'cause i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a tv , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . i do n't think there 's much to be gained in that area . project manager : the number of buttons ? i think it 's very important in the in the design . marketing : yeah . project manager : you can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with marketing : that is true but i think there 's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you 're making a remote control only for to operate only the tv . project manager : to operate only the tv yeah . marketing : 'cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a tv there 's simply not a lot of buttons required . there 's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do n't have a lot of buttons either . so i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . project manager : 'kay . so we can marketing : that would that would cost a a big marketing expedition project manager : yeah . that 's right . marketing : which was one of the arguments to make it only for the tv because we did n't have the time to market a lot . project manager : yeah . so you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . user interface : project manager : uh uh like other functions . instead of f of less buttons ."
