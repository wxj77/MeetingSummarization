    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about financial aims and target markets of the new remote control project .",
    "answer": "marketing : project manager : um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five euros . our selling price . uh our profit aim is fifty million euros . uh that 's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . um but that 's all in the later stadium . our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half euros , so that 's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we wo n't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . it wo n't work . so just try to remember these points . selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we 're trying to focus on . and production cost uh maximal twelve and a half euros . so that 's leads us to our little discussion . we 've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . so i 'm gon na sit down , i think . it 's easier . marketing : yeah , you got a message . project manager : i 've got a message . five minutes . okay , user interface : five minutes , okay ."
