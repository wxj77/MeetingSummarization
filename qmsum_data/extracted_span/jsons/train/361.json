    "query": "<s> what did marketing think about functional requirements about remote control ?",
    "answer": "marketing : kijke 'kay , so . we 're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just yeah , and the users , actually . industrial designer : marketing : the methods i i prefer is we 're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? and then tho that section we 're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . okay . some data . younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like lcd screens , speech recognition e etcetera . and we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . the elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that 's two fifth , of the market share in that area . goed so . project manager : marketing : 'kay . findings . fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : so we do n't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you do n't lose it that much anymore . seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or should n't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . next . important issues about the remote . i think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . the volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . and have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . it has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . my colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s uh senden user interface : marketing : okay . so uh if that 's k uh if that 's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . buttons . like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in lcd screen . lcd screen is easy because we have the lcd screen , we have the various options . put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . and you do n't see the buttons . so lcd screens should be easy , but an lcd screen , the problem with the l_ sc lcd screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years do n't use the lcd screen a lot . so we have to that keep that in mind that if you 're going to implement lcd screen , you do n't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . industrial designer : uh lcd screen as in uh touch screen ? marketing : yeah , touch screen , yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : the last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . and the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : so we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . and on my personal preferences , i do n't have any mo more time to come with that , user interface : marketing : but like i said , lcd screen is easily to use industrial designer :"
