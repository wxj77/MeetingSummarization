    "answer": "grad b : well , like in ai they generally do the take in , and then they also do the generation phase , like nancy 's thing . or uh , you remember , in the the hand thing in one - eighty - two , like not only was it able to recognize but it was also to generate based upon situations . you mean that sort of thing ? grad d : absolutely . and once you 've done that what we can do is have the system ask itself . and answer , understand the answer , ask something else , and enter a dialogue with itself . so the the ba basic the same idea as having two chess computers play against each other . grad e : except this smacks a little bit more of a schizophrenic computer than ai . grad d : yeah you c if you want , you can have two parallel machines um , asking each other . what would that give us ? would a be something completely weird and strange , and b , i if you look at all the factors , we will never observe people let 's say , in wheelchairs under you know , in under all conditions , grad e : that 's good . grad d : you know , when they say `` x `` , and there is a ride at the goal , and the parking is good , we can never collect enough data . it 's it 's it 's not possible . grad e : mm - hmm . right , right . grad d : but maybe one could do some learning . if you get the system to speak to itself , you may find n break downs and errors and you may be able to learn . and make it more robust , maybe learn new things . and um , so there 's no no end of potential things one could get out of it , if that works . and he would like to actually work on that with us . grad b : well then , he probably should be coming back a year from now . grad d : so yeah , i w see the the generation bit , making the system generate generate something , { comment } is should n't be too hard . grad b : well , once the system understands things . grad e : yeah . no problem . grad b : i just do n't think i think we 're probably a year away from getting the system to understand things . grad d : yeah . well , if we can get it to understand one thing , like our `` where is `` run through we can also , maybe , e make it say , or ask `` where is x ? `` or not . grad e : mmm , i do n't know . e i 'm sort of have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on , you know , i mean just cuz it 's sort of harder to learn to speak correctly in a foreign language , rather than learning to understand it . right ? i mean just the fact that we 'll get the point is that getting it to understand one construction does n't mean that it will n always know exactly when it 's correct to use that construction . right ? grad d : it 's it 's uh well , i 've i 've done generation and language production research for fo four four and a half years . and so it 's it 's you 're right , it 's not the same as the understanding . it 's in some ways easier and some ways harder . nuh ? grad e : yeah . grad d : but , um , i think it 'd be fun to look at it , or into that question . grad e : nnn , yeah . grad d : it 's a pretty strange idea . and so that 's that 's but grad b : the basic idea i guess would be to give allow the system to have intentions , basically ? cuz that 's basically what needs to be added to the system for it . grad d : well , look at th eee , i think even think even what it would be the the prior intention . so let 's uh uh , let 's say we have this grad b : well we 'd have to seed that , i mean . grad d : no . let 's we have to we have some some top - down processing , given certain setting . ok , now we change nothing , and just say ask something . right ? what would it ask ? grad b : it would n't know what to ask . i mean . grad d : it shur grad b : unless it was in a situation . we 'd have to set up a situation where , it did n't know where something was and it wanted to go there . grad d : yeah ! grad c : mm - hmm . grad d : yeah . grad b : which means that we 'd need to set up an intention inside of the system . right ? which is basically , `` i do n't know where something is and i need to go there `` . grad d : eh , n grad e : yeah . grad d : ooh , do we really need to do that ? because , grad b : well , no i guess not . excel grad d : s it 's i i know it 's it 's strange , but look at it look at our bayes - net . if we do n't have let 's assume we do n't have any input from the language . right ? so there 's also nothing we could query the ontology , but we have a certain user setting . if you just ask , what is the likelihood of that person wanting to enter some something , it 'll give you an answer ."
