    "answer": "project manager : today , functional design phase . i 'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting . okay , that was just to get to know each other , have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , so i put the minutes on the i made on the on the p the the project share , so if you wan na review them , they 're there . i will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wan na take back you can find it there . anyways , um today three presentations , from every one of you . um after that i got some new project requirements from project board , so we 're gon na go af go after over this later . but i wan na start with uh stuff you did first , so we can see what everybody came up with . and after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so . who would like wan na go first ? marketing : yeah , sure , no problem . project manager : take it . user interface : go ahead . marketing : um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh project manager : anyway , let 's see what you have . marketing : yeah . um okay , project manager : uh it 's still a bit open . marketing : i want to open the my s oh no . project manager : you should close it on your own notebook , i guess . yeah . so there ? marketing : oh no , project manager : okay . marketing : that 's okay . uh slide show . yes . the functional requirements , it 's uh uh very important for uh the user , he he wants to yeah . the the method we used uh it it 's not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use uh , um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men , and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what 's uh important . uh project manager : if i can cut in , is it people or men ? marketing : people , project manager : is it people , okay . marketing : sorry . project manager : 'cause i thought it was only men , marketing : both women and men , project manager : so marketing : yeah . project manager : 'kay . marketing : okay . uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . um user interface : that 's pretty shocking uh . project manager : so we have to s we have to do something about that . marketing : yeah , and yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , and um they use yeah , they use zap a lot , um uh fifty percent say they only so that 's the most important things . project manager : okay . marketing : um oh yeah , not all of it is it on mine on my powerpoint presentation , project manager : okay , just talk ahead . marketing : but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : it 's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use . uh less important is tel teletext , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : uh um they use it , but it 's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh project manager : okay , that 's okay . user interface : marketing : and but not important is the channel selection , the the hmm ? project manager : that 's a little weird . marketing : oh , user interface : which channel selection ? marketing : the the no no no no no , that 's very important , but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings project manager : okay , marketing : and uh project manager : we can we can hide those under a menu or something , user interface : oh , okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : um new preferences preferences . uh um um beep to find your control , was project manager : that 's like a button on your tv ? marketing : that was in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they can not find a rem their remote control , project manager : remote , okay . marketing : so uh i think it 's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . and another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to let 's go to channel one and uh that 's uh kind of things . project manager : okay . marketing : and they want maybe an uh lcd screen um to to look it um wh what 's on every channel uh and uh what do i want with it ? user interface : project manager : we wan na have a little preview on the remote control . preview what 's on the channel . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . user interface : is that manageable ? 'cause it sounds pretty expensive too . project manager : that sounds too marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's possible , but uh i think it 's expensive , but do continue . user interface : okay . marketing : yeah . um uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so i can uh i dunno , so i can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what i uh so , the remote mu must see or um must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , project manager : okay , you do n't set it yourself , marketing : so i can zap t to project manager : it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . marketing : what ? project manager : you want the you want it to be programmed , for example y programmed f marketing : yeah . project manager : or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? marketing : yeah . project manager : let 's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , marketing : recognise project manager : so it recognises your favourite channel . marketing : yeah . yeah , that 's uh what my personal preference like . project manager : okay , so it 's it it does it recognise itself , you do n't have to set it okay . marketing : itself . maybe it 's easier to to sell it , but project manager : okay . marketing : i do n't know it 's manageable , but we will uh we will see . project manager : i see . marketing : yeah , it 's a little bit uh it 's the end of it . project manager : okay . marketing : it 's a little bit uh i lost it , user interface : okay . marketing : the computer uh crashed , project manager : no problem , it 's it 's okay , that 's yeah , go ahead . user interface : shall i go ? okay . marketing : yeah . user interface : so , some technical functions . marketing : darn computer . user interface : basically i have some issues which you discussed earlier . uh let 's just start with the method . marketing : yeah . user interface : it sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues . so the things i 'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that 's pretty much covered . we can do that . what goes wrong at the user . gets the remote control . where is the remote control ? we 've all had it once , i want to watch some television , marketing : yeah . user interface : where 's the remote control ? that was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , marketing : yeah . project manager : that seems very good . user interface : a really good idea . uh these are just the issues . i come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . searches for the button . there are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . marketing : mm uh . user interface : there 's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you do n't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find uh something for that , project manager : okay , so have it more make it more durable actually . okay . user interface : yes . uh covered that . oh yes , user presses the button . um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . so you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that , project manager : okay , so the buttons should be user interface : so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah . user interface : and possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger project manager : wow . the s yeah . make it make them bigger . even more durable uh . user interface : so this is basically what i h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others . uh project manager : okay . user interface : this i pretty much covered . so what we want to go to is not this one , project manager : yeah , it 's true . user interface : but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons . marketing : yeah . user interface : that 's basically uh what i had in mind . so project manager : yeah , that 's clear . user interface : this is not the final design , project manager : no , of course uh user interface : this is just a general idea of how i 'd like to see uh basically the general idea . project manager : yeah . i must say that it hmm . user interface : so that was it . project manager : that was it . okay , that was good . so we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing , user interface : yeah , i think it 's a really good idea . project manager : so user interface : yeah . project manager : the other aspects , we 'll just see how what you came up with and what 's possible for that budget . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : okay , that 's fine . um . okay , now work a little with me . okay . well , project manager : industrial designer : let 's start it as it is . okay , uh the method . there are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? i 'll tell you why that 's important to me . um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that 's why i also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh i heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . project manager : yeah . of course , hmm . industrial designer : so it 's that 's not as easy as it s might look like . user interface : okay . industrial designer : uh material study , i 'm working on that um for the the costs . i have to check out how far i can go with that . normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , i think we can just go on with that . um then i 've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . the more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper . project manager : you mean integrate them all into the circuit board . okay . industrial designer : exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that 's cheaper . project manager : yeah , okay . industrial designer : so we have to make something that 's not too difficult in design again . project manager : so you have industrial designer : this is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . you have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . the switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a morse code , that 's how you should see it . the morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . you have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it ? uh a light in indication , light that you know that it 's functioning . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh here again , that 's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different morse code when some button is pressed . that makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . uh i do n't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light . project manager : okay . okay . that was it ?"
