    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about amendments in group 1 that related to the duty to promote public awareness ?",
    "answer": "julie morgan am : thank you very much , chair . my amendments 1 and 4 will place a duty on welsh ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the act commences . i tabled these amendments in response to this committee 's recommendation\u2014this was a recommendation from this committee in the stage 1 report , so i have responded to that . i 've already made a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over approximately six years from royal assent , should the bill be passed . i 've considered amendments 1a to 1e , which have been tabled by janet finch-saunders , and which relate to the duty to raise awareness . amendment 1a introduces a reference to public understanding . we do n't think , actually , that this adds anything to the government amendment , which already mentions awareness . it makes the awareness-raising duty open-ended with no time limit , which is not necessary . by commencement , messaging around the change in the law will be embedded . the awareness-raising campaign will continue for a number of years . therefore , an ongoing duty referring specifically to the law change would not be required . i understand , of course , that the awareness-raising campaign needs to be comprehensive , well planned and to reach out to all those people and all those communities who need to be aware of the law change , and understand how to respond to it . but i do n't think it 's helpful or necessary to highlight specific groups , such as visitors to wales , on the face of the bill\u2014that 's the approach taken in amendment 1e\u2014as it risks placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others . in relation to children , the committee will know that i 'm fully committed to children \u2019 s rights , and that welsh ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions . an additional due regard requirement , such as the one set out in amendment 1d , relating specifically to the need to promote awareness among children is not needed . this would be part and parcel of the welsh government approach to putting children \u2019 s rights at the heart of our policy making . similarly , i do n't think it 's necessary for the bill to set out specifically the topics that need to be covered in the awareness-raising campaign , as is suggested in amendments 1b and 1c . that level of detail , i do n't think , is for the face of the bill . information required about parenting support will be considered by the parenting expert group , under the auspices of the bill \u2019 s strategic implementation group , working with my officials and the expert stakeholder group on the awareness-raising campaign . and , really , their thinking should not be constrained in any way by specifications on the face of the bill . i think we always need to bear in mind that what the bill does is remove a defence to an existing criminal offence ; it does not create a new offence . and in this context , it does n't make sense for this bill to contain a provision requiring the provision of information about how a person may raise concerns if it appears to them that a child is being physically punished . as i set out in my letter to this committee responding to recommendation 15 on this point , safeguarding is everyone \u2019 s business , and , as now , the public have a role in highlighting to relevant services if they are concerned about a child . i 'm asking for the support of members for amendments 1 and 4 , and i ask members to reject amendments 1a to 1e because this would place unnecessary provisions on the face of the bill . lynne neagle am : thank you , deputy minister . are there other members who wish to speak ? janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : thank you , chair . i wish to speak to amendments 1a to 1e , which relate to the deputy minister 's amendment on the duty to promote public awareness . while we believe it is absolutely imperative that the public are made aware of this controversial change in the law , the deputy minister 's amendment lacks a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at stage 1 . an important thread runs throughout each and every amendment that i 've tabled within this group\u2014that of a sustained awareness campaign , which not only stretches beyond the implementation of the bill , but serves as a duty for future administrations . amendment 1a : primarily , amendment 1a changes amendment 1 to include the promotion of understanding changes to the law . i do n't think it 's enough for the welsh government to say that the public should be made aware of the coming into force of section 1 and that a public awareness campaign needs to be sustained until the welsh government 's objectives have been achieved . despite the fact that it is intended to change behaviour , the consequences of this law are far greater than that of organ donation or prohibiting smoking indoors . instead of an opt-out system or a civil offence , this law will remove a defence for parents , information on which could be there on their records for the rest of their lives , potentially separate parents , and could affect employment chances . as such , whilst we agree with the necessity of the awareness campaign , it is important too that the welsh government take stock and ensures that parents are not penalised due to a weak awareness campaign . the witnesses we heard before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands\u2014 lynne neagle am : janet , dawn is asking if you 'll take an intervention . dawn bowden am : i just wanted to know\u2014could you give us examples of any other piece of legislation where there 's been indefinite public awareness campaigns once it 's been passed ? janet finch-saunders am : there 's a lot of legislation . the first assembly term when i was here\u2014 dawn bowden am : yes , what i 'm asking\u2014 janet finch-saunders am : i 'm trying to respond\u2014 dawn bowden am : what i 'm asking for is : can you give us specific examples of where there have been indefinite public awareness campaigns running indefinitely past the enactment of a piece of legislation ? janet finch-saunders am : the very first term that i was an assembly member , we passed 25 pieces of separate legislation . even today , as i sit here , the public are not aware of many of those pieces of legislation . this particular piece of legislation will have a profound effect on the parenting of children in wales . so , therefore , i think there is a necessity for both children and parents to become involved , and i shall speak now\u2014 dawn bowden am : with respect , chair , that 's not the question i asked . janet finch-saunders am : \u2014to my amendments . lynne neagle am : i can call you in the debate , if you 'd like to make a more substantive contribution on this . yes . janet finch-saunders am : the witnesses who we heard from before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands the implications . and that 's what we 're talking about here , members\u2014the implications of removing this defence . strikingly , the office of police and crime commissioner for gwent stated the following : 'the potential for public resistance to the bill through misunderstanding or confusion over it implications may pose the largest barrier to its implementation . ' if you are intent on removing the defence of reasonable punishment , it is therefore not unreasonable to ensure that law-abiding parents fully understand the ramifications of this bill . additionally , the committee found that while the current welsh government 's intention to deliver a public awareness campaign was beyond doubt , future governments may have less of a commitment . this places further weight on the fact that the welsh government should be under a duty to promote awareness and understanding of the bill beyond its commencement . furthermore , the children ( equal protection from assault ) ( scotland ) bill quite clearly notes that , under section 2 , the scottish ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of section 1 on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment . therefore , i would be grateful if the deputy minister can respond as to the reasons why the welsh government has deviated from this course of action in their amendment . [ interruption . ] should our amendment be agreed\u2014 lynne neagle am : are you taking an intervention ? janet finch-saunders am : no . i 'd rather crack on , to be honest . lynne neagle am : okay . i can call you in the debate , hefin . janet finch-saunders am : should our amendment to be agreed , we also request that a printing change be made to ensure that the new heading reflects promoting awareness of the changes to the law made by section 1 . amendment 1b : amendment 1b is in line with the committee 's recommendation 9 , which stated that , as part of a public awareness campaign , there should be details about the support available to parents to use alternatives to physical punishment when disciplining their children . during evidence at stage 1 , the witnesses we saw before the committee raised serious concerns about harder-to-reach groups who needed to be made aware of removing the defence . for example , children in wales , action for children and play wales stated that some families and communities may be harder to reach with information and support . welsh government needs to make sure that they receive the information they need . now , while the deputy minister states that she would work hard to ensure that harder-to-reach groups receive this information , a duty to provide information on alternatives to physical punishment would ensure that future welsh governments would maintain a successful awareness-raising campaign . i note the deputy minister accepted the recommendation , through our amendment , but this does not explicitly include a duty to provide details about support for parents . as will be expanded upon later , the deputy minister has relied upon the 'parenting : give it time ' campaign to be delivered alongside awareness raising . however , this is only an online resource and she must be clear about what other avenues will be available to parents who do not have access to the internet or are part of harder-to-reach groups . amendment 1c : amendment 1c supports the committee 's recommendation 15 that explains that the welsh government should ensure clear advice is provided on what people can do if they have seen or learned of a child being physically assaulted . we urged , at stage 1 , that although many professionals were already under a duty to report concerns about physical punishment , regardless of the bill , other witnesses raised concerns that it could create the potential for claims of abuse that are unfounded . in particular , some were worried that children , who may not realise the implications of reporting , could make allegations that are actually untrue . while we would expect the awareness-raising campaign to include the consequences of false accusations , this could also be reflected among adults , if the public are not sufficiently made aware of how they can report and in what situations they can report a case of assault . lynne neagle am : thank you . i 've got several speakers . i 've got suzy davies first , then dawn bowden . suzy davies am : thank you very much , chair . thank you minister , and thank you , janet , for that . i think it 's worth just pointing out at this stage that the majority of the amendments that are being made and articulated by janet there are based on committee recommendations , and those recommendations were made after taking evidence from the public at large , but also you as well . so , that suggests that , at that stage , we were n't reassured by the offer that you were making because we felt the need to put these recommendations into our report . now , i recognise that you 've moved some way on some of these amendments , and we 'll been talking about that through the course of the debates on other groups . but the one thing to bear in mind here is this is legislation , now\u2014that means that this is the instrument of the assembly , not of government , and if this assembly feels that the face of the bill is unclear on the minimum requirements of a public awareness campaign , then we have the right to suggest the things that we would like to see in that public awareness-raising campaign . the list that janet has given is a minimum . the reason these have been tabled individually and independently is that some may be acceptable where others may not be , so it will be disappointing to hear that you 're rejecting them all , and the reason they need to go on the face of the bill is that , if you are going to introduce specifics via regulation , at the moment we have no reassurance about how you 're going to do that\u2014about what input the assembly , on behalf of our constituents , could have in designing that public awareness-raising campaign . unless you accept some amendments in other groups , that is the position with this bill : the influence of the assembly will be zero over the content of an awareness-raising campaign . in terms of it being non-time limited , i think the amendment has been tabled in the way it has not to oblige you to an everlasting , never-ending campaign of awareness raising . but if you bear in mind that , seven years after the introduction of this bill , there 's going to be some reporting on the effectiveness of the bill , what is the point of doing that if you do n't then have an obligation , should the reports require it to be necessary , to continue promoting the changes in the law ? i accept that that ca n't go on for centuries , but to actually limit it to two years on an issue that is so sensitive , and which has a reach beyond our boundaries , i think is genuinely a mistake . finally , you mention that safeguarding is everyone 's business . i think that 's true , but i think janet finch-saunders was right to say that members of the public , ordinary individuals , not professionals , will need assurance that they 're doing the right thing . the amendment as listed is not even there to encourage people to do that , although that can be read in that way , but it is to help them be certain that they are doing the right thing . if this is going to be up to the individual , as you 've said , and the committee itself was n't reassured that individuals would know what to do , perhaps i can ask you to consider at stage 3 , if you 're going to reject this amendment , how you can reassure members of the public that , if they are going to intervene on the back of this law , they 're making things better , not worse . lynne neagle am : thank you , suzy . dawn . dawn bowden am : my comments , really , relate to ongoing awareness-raising campaigns , which i think all of us would want to see , and would appreciate in any changes in legislation . my point , really , is that we have a plethora of legislation that this assembly has passed in the last 20 years , and i 'm not aware of any legislation where , on the face of the bill we have ongoing awareness-raising campaigns on an indefinite basis . it seems to me that , for some reason , you seem to be wanting to take a completely different approach to this piece of legislation . from what the deputy minister is saying\u2014and perhaps i will get some clarity on this\u2014there will be an amendment to the legislation that will say that we have an awareness campaign . that awareness campaign can be the subject of consultation with interested parties in terms of what needs to be included in it . it could also , i assume , deputy minister , be an awareness campaign that can be written into a set of guidance for future use . but the point i 'm trying to make is that i do n't believe that any piece of legislation requires ongoing and indefinite awareness-raising campaigns , and particularly in relation to visitors to wales . again , we have other pieces of legislation in wales that are not applicable in the other parts of the uk . i am not aware that there is a necessity for awareness-raising campaigns with visitors coming into wales on the raft of the other pieces of legislation that we have that they do n't . and similarly , when we go to visit countries that have different legislation , we do n't necessarily know what legislation we 're going into when we visit that country\u2014you just go there and you accept that you go to a different country and you abide by their laws . so , my key point , chair , is just the necessity of an ongoing , endless awareness campaign being written onto the face of the bill . lynne neagle am : thank you , dawn . hefin . hefin david am : my comments follow logically from dawn bowden 's comments , particularly in relation to amendments 1d and 1e . what you would be doing is that this senedd , if this was on the face of the bill , the duty on ministers , would be putting the duty on ministers in law beyond the life of the fifth senedd , into the next senedd term , and putting that duty on those newly elected ministers after that , which , in principle , would be against the principles of binding\u2014 lynne neagle am : hefin , are you taking an intervention from suzy ? hefin david am : yes , happy to . suzy davies am : when you 've finished your point . hefin david am : i 'm happy to take it now , because i was going to sum up by agreeing with the point you made , actually . suzy davies am : i 'd love that . you referred to this potentially binding ministers in future assemblies ; at the moment , we 've got an implementation period and a five-year reporting period that takes any reporting on this act into the assembly after next . i 'm wondering if you 're going to have any comments on that when we come to the amendment to change that later on . hefin david am : well , when we get to that amendment , i 'll make comments if i feel it necessary . but at this point in time , we 're talking about amendments 1d and 1e , and particularly in relation to 1d and 1e it just is n't necessary , given the fact that\u2014i wo n't call it a concession , because i think you made a reasonable point about the minister making a statement at stage 3 , and i think dawn bowden actually supported that as well . that , therefore , makes those amendments unnecessary . given that , in these circumstances , it is unnecessary to bind ministers in future parliaments . and that 's my key point , really , which is why i would n't vote for those two amendments . lynne neagle am : thank you . si\u00e2n . sian gwenllian am : thank you very much . i just want to speak against amendment 1a and also amendment 1b . i do n't believe that there is a need for an indefinite campaign , as is outlined in 1a . i agree entirely that there is a need for a campaign during the period of change , and therefore i 'm very glad to see that the government has brought forward amendment 1 , and i do hope that there will be a real push during the period of change . in terms of amendment 1b , i do have sympathy with what is being said here , but i believe that any kind of information or campaign in terms of enabling parents to learn about alternatives to physical punishment should be the subject of continual far-reaching work by the government , through various programmes , and it should not be an addition on the face of this bill , which deals with a small change to the common law . and then , on 1d also , if i may\u2014i do n't agree with this either . again , i believe that there is a need to promote awareness amongst children , but that should happen through the children 's rights convention , as part of a broader programme to promote children 's rights . lynne neagle am : thank you , si\u00e2n . i call on the deputy minister to speak , then . julie morgan am : thank you all very much for your contributions to the debate and your comments on these amendments today . i just want to re-emphasise that it is as a result of the recommendation from this committee that we are putting this duty to have the awareness campaign on the face of the bill , and i absolutely recognise the crucial role awareness raising has to play in supporting the implementation of the bill . i 'm very grateful for and appreciate the committee 's interest and the work that you 've done in this area of work . but i do think that these amendments are unnecessary . if we go through them , amendment 1a is really open-ended on promoting public awareness . we 're committed to a high-intensity awareness over six years from royal assent , and there is an expert stakeholder group supporting us with the development of the awareness campaign . all the points that you 've been making will be being considered by that group . i think the level of detail on the face of the bill is not needed . suzy davies am : okay . would you just take an intervention on that just to help me understand ? a two-year awareness-raising campaign\u2014how have you concluded that\u2014 julie morgan am : six-year . suzy davies am : i thought it was two years before section 1 comes into force . julie morgan am : we 've got six years from royal assent . suzy davies am : oh , so it is going to continue beyond section 1 coming into force\u2014 julie morgan am : yes . oh yes , it 's going to continue . suzy davies am : that 's very helpful . julie morgan am : definitely , yes . so , i do n't think that 's needed , amendment 1a . amendment 1b , about support available to parents and how to access it\u2014again , this level of detail is not required on the face of the bill . i just want to emphasise we have got this expert implementation group , who are working on all aspects of this bill , many of whom represent organisations who gave evidence to this committee . the bill is a simple one , with a clear purpose . it aims to remove the defence of reasonable punishment . i think lots of these amendments are very helpful and interesting , but would be discussed and would be acted on in the normal pathway of planning and development , and they 're not required on the face of the bill . so , i 'm not putting them down , i 'm just saying that we do n't need them to be there on the face of the bill . and then amendment 1c\u2014the information about how to raise concerns\u2014i do repeat that safeguarding is everybody 's business , and the same issues apply now as will after this defence has been removed . amendment 1d\u2014ministers to have regard to the need to promote awareness among children\u2014now , children 's rights are absolutely enshrined in our policy making , and the entire bill is about protecting the rights of children . so , it is unnecessary duplication . so , we hope that the bill will remain focused . again , in terms of visitors , the level of detail is simply not required on the face of the bill . our awareness-raising campaign will be comprehensive . and then to pick up a few of the other points that were raised , revisions to the impact assessments are being considered as part of my commitment to update the explanatory memorandum ahead of stage 3 . so , there will be more details on the regulatory impact assessment . the issue that was raised about the scottish bill , that it refers to 'understanding'\u2014now , the scottish bill was not a government bill , it was a private member 's bill , and our view is that nothing is added by adding the 'understanding ' ; 'awareness ' is sufficient . so , basically , i think that the points made have been very useful , but i urge committee members to accept my amendments , but to reject those proposed by janet finch-saunders , as they are unnecessary provisions in terms of what the awareness-raising duty needs to achieve . lynne neagle am : thank you , deputy minister . before disposing of amendment 1 , we will deal with the amendments to that amendment . janet , do you wish to move amendment 1a ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : thank you . the question is that amendment 1a be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] okay , we have an objection . i therefore take a vote by show of hands . the question is that amendment 1a be agreed . all those in favour , please raise your hands . all those against . there voted two in favour , four against . so , amendment 1a is not agreed . janet , do you wish to move amendment 1b ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 1b be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] okay , i 'll take a vote by show of hands . all those in favour of amendment 1b . all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against . amendment 1b is not agreed . janet , do you wish to move amendment 1c ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : thank you . the question is that amendment 1c be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] okay . all those in favour of amendment 1c , please show . all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against , and amendment 1c is not agreed . janet , do you want to move amendment 1d ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : thank you . the question is that amendment 1d be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] okay , as there 's an objection , i 'll take a vote . all those in favour of amendment 1d , please show . all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against , and amendment 1d is not agreed . janet , do you wish to move amendment 1e ? okay . the question is that amendment 1e be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] okay , we 'll take a vote . all those in favour of amendment 1e , please show . all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against , and amendment 1e is not agreed . if amendment 1 is not agreed , amendment 2c and amendment 4 will fall . deputy minister , do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 1 ?"
