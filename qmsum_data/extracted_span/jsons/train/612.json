    "answer": "the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : mr.blaney , the honourable member for bellechasseles etcheminslvis , has the floor . hon . steven blaney ( bellechasseles etcheminslvis , cpc ) : thank you , madamchair . last week , my plumber told me that , each time justin trudeau comes down the steps to make announcements totalling several billion dollars , he feels like someone is rifling through his pockets . my question is simple and goes to the minister of finance : where is this money coming from ? hon . mona fortier : madamchair , i would like to thank my honourable colleague for his question . currently , the health and safety of canadians are our top priorities . we have implemented an emergency economic plan to support canadians , workers and companies . we will continue to support them during this crisis . hon . steven blaney : the answer i would have liked is simple : we are borrowing the money and we are going to have to pay it back one day . that is another liberal craze : they borrow money , they make campaign promises , and off they go . under the conservative government , the chantier davie in lvis had 1,700workers for the supply ship asterix . in the election campaign , the liberals promised icebreakers . when are the liberals going to award the icebreaker contracts to the chantier davie ? hon . david lametti ( minister of justice and attorney general of canada ) : madamchair , we are very proud of the chantier davie and we completely understand its role in the system . we are currently assessing those requests . we are going to establish the process for the polar ice-breaker , which is essential for the work of the coast guard in northern communities , and we are going to make sure that the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : mr.blaney has the floor . hon . steven blaney : the workers do not need words ; they need contracts and jobs . the same is true for young people who want to work . there is money in the canada summer jobs program : in my constituency alone , $ 150,000has been approved . companies want young people to work and want to hire them . what is the minister waiting for in order to confirm those positions ? in my constituency , and everywhere else in the country , our young people want to work . what is the government waiting for in order to send some cash to the canada summer jobs program ? hon . ahmed hussen : madam chair , we are proud of the canada summer jobs program . we are introducing flexibilities into the system to enable employers to be able to hire summer students . we recognize the importance of this program to provide both financial resources and necessary experience for young people . we believe in continuing to invest in the canada summer jobs program . hon . steven blaney : the workers , the young people and the employers have been waiting for weeks . the money is available ; where is the announcement ? madamchair , our young people are not the only ones who want to work . there are also the temporary foreign workers . let me use jessie gito as an example ; he has been working at plate2000 in saint-anselme for years . when the time came to renew his work permit , he found out that he has to have some biometric tests . but he can not get them because the offices are closed . is the minister going to allow jessie gito and the thousands of other temporary foreign workers who want to work to be able to do so until the government biometric testing centres reopen ? hon . ahmed hussen : madam chair , it is important for the honourable member to recognize that we are in the early recovery stage of the pandemic . employers are slowly reopening businesses . we will ensure that we support both our students and our temporary foreign workers to make sure we get the recovery right . we will continue to invest in the canada summer jobs program . we 've introduced flexibilities into the program to ensure that employers are able to take advantage of the program and give opportunities to young people . hon . steven blaney : it is very simple . jessie gito is a foreign worker , who is in a company that provides an essential service . he needs a decision that will let him go to work , rather than staying home and doing nothing . then , when the government 's biometric testing centres are open again , he will gladly go to one . young people want to work in agriculture as well , and the minister has told us that the government wants young people working and that their files will be processed as quickly as possible . she wants to create 700positions and she knows that people can fill in an application on a first-come first-served basis . of those 700positions , how many have been confirmed to date ? the good weather has arrived , the corn is starting to grow , and this is the time when farmers need the young workers . hon . marie-claude bibeau ( minister of agriculture and agri-food ) : madamchair , the program for young workers in agriculture is open . i also encourage agricultural producers to register for it . this is a program that is not only intended to provide summer jobs , but also to interest young people in making a career in agriculture . as i have said before , the department is processing files as quickly as possible . each employer will have an answer very shortly . the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : we will now take a short break . okay , we are ready to start again . we will go to the honourable member for barriespringwateroro-medonte . mr. doug shipley ( barriespringwateroro-medonte , cpc ) : thank you , chair . over the course of the pandemic , has the government been using all avenues possible to source much-needed ppe in canada ? hon . navdeep bains : madam chair , we have been very clear that we have a made-in-canada initiative that has engaged companies across the country . over 700 companies have retooled and scaled up their operations for personal protective equipment to help front-line health care workers . mr. doug shipley : madam chair , i need to ask very quickly which ministry and minister are responsible for the sourcing of ppe in canada . hon . navdeep bains : madam chair , this is a collective effort . i work with the minister of health and the minister for procurement , and we coordinate with the provinces and territories to make sure there are appropriate levels of ppe to help front-line health care workers and essential workers across the country . mr. doug shipley : thank you for that clarification . that will make this question all the more pertinent . my riding of barriespringwateroro-medonte is the home of southmedic inc. southmedic is a renowned medical supply business . for over 37 years , it has provided front-line health care workers with an extensive line of ppe and other essential products required when dealing with respiratory illnesses . this company specializes in respiratory illness equipment . southmedic currently employs over 700 people , and it has been recognized as one of canada 's best-managed companies by deloitte on numerous occasions . since the beginning of the pandemic , both i and the member for barrieinnisfil have been attempting to obtain some assistance for southmedic from the federal government . calls and emails were falling on deaf ears . in early may , i wrote a letter to minister anand outlining the situation . i received a letter back from the minister dated may 27 indicating that this issue of southmedic falls under the mandate of the minister of innovation , science and economic development canada . i have heard nothing more . when will the federal government reach out and help this great canadian company and therefore ensure that all front-line workers will have the proper ppe they require ? hon . navdeep bains : madam chair , i 'd like to thank my honourable colleague for his question . he knows full well that this is a very challenging time . that is why we had a call to action to engage canadians right across the country . since then , we 've seen over 6,000 companies step up to offer solutions and ideas , and over 700 companies have retooled their efforts . i acknowledge that some companies are still engaging with the government , and we 'll continue to explore all possible options to make sure we continue to procure the necessary levels of personal protective equipment to protect canadians and to protect front-line health care workers . that has always been our priority . i want to thank the outstanding canadian companies that have come forward and have helped us in this endeavour . we continue to look forward to working with them . mr. doug shipley : thank you for that answer . just to follow up , there 's no retooling required at this company . they could have been up and going very quickly . they just needed a little assistance at the beginning . moving on to a different issue , while walking to my office this morning , i stopped at my local small family-run coffee shop and was discussing the current economic situation with the two owners of the establishment . they indicated they are having a very tough time surviving this economic downturn . the only thing keeping them hopeful is that soon the public service will start returning to work , and therefore their business will begin to return . could the government please give us some indication as to what the plans are for returning the civil service back to work safely , and when ? hon . jean-yves duclos ( president of the treasury board ) : thank you , madam chair . i 'm delighted to answer this question . this is a very important topic , but i 'd like to take the opportunity first to thank our public servants , who have worked very hard in the last few weeks , both personally and professionally . in fact , today is a wonderful day to say that , because today is the start of national public service week . that 's one more reason to thank them for their dedicated work . they are not going to go back to work . they 've been at work for the last few monthsin different circumstances , but they have been working very hard to deliver the services and the support canadians need and deserve . the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : next we 'll go to the honourable member for selkirkinterlakeeastman , mr. bezan . mr. james bezan ( selkirkinterlakeeastman , cpc ) : thank you , madam chair . my questions are for the minister of national defence . first of all , i want to thank the great men and women of the canadian armed forces for the fantastic job they 're doing in operation laser , serving on the front lines battling covid-19 . can the minister of national defence give the house an update on exactly where we are at with the number of canadian armed forces members who have been infected with covid-19 ? hon . harjit s. sajjan ( minister of national defence ) : madam chair , i want to echo the member opposite 's comments in thanking our canadian armed forces members . currently , we have 13 active cases in the canadian armed forces , but in the long-term care facilities we currently have 50 cases . no member has been currently hospitalized . we have also conducted very thorough reviews of our protection protocols as well . mr. james bezan : through you , chair , minister sajjan , does that number of active cases include the active cases that are in long-term care facilities right now in operation laser ? hon . harjit s. sajjan : madam chair , as i stated , the 50 cases are strictly from the long-term care facilities . the 13 cases i mentioned are not in the long-term care facilities . just to give the actual clarification , no member has been currently hospitalized . mr. james bezan : in those numbers , madam chair , can mr. sajjan say how many of those cases in long-term care facilities are active and how many are recovered ? hon . harjit s. sajjan : madam chair , i do n't have the exact number . what i can say to break it down further is that in quebec we currently have 36 and in ontario we have 14 . as well , 36 of the members have been out of isolation . i 'll get more details and pass them on directly to the member , madam chair . mr. james bezan : thank you , minister . madam chair , i have a quick question while we 're still talking about operation laser . the president of the treasury board has said , the canadian armed forces will be present as long as their presence is needed in quebec . this contradicts what prime minister trudeau is saying , which is that we have a hard deadline of june 26 for the withdrawal of our troops for operation laser . that means taking our troops out of our long-term care facilities . minister , is june 26 the hard date for the winding down of operation laser ? hon . bill blair : thank you very much , madam chair . i 'm delighted to have the opportunity to clarify for the house . we 've been in very extensive discussions with the province of quebec , with my counterpart minister guilbault , and we are working very diligently to ensure we have a sustained , appropriate response to the request from quebec for assistance . that response will result in a transition from the currently deployed canadian armed forces to the deployment of paid volunteers , trained personnel who will take on the important role of providing services to those canadians who need our help in quebec . mr. james bezan : i 'll go back to the minister of national defence . the department of national defence auditors have called out the liberal government for mismanagement over the $ 553-billion investment in our canadian military through the defence policy . only three people have been assigned to oversee the rollout of this money . this is a $ 553-billion investment in our armed forces , and only three people are managing it . could the minister tell us how that is even possible ? is this the reason that over 100 projects are currently behind schedule ? hon . harjit s. sajjan : madam chair , first of all , i want to highlight the unprecedented investment that we 're making in defence . we have conducted internal reviews of our procurement . the report the member opposite is talking about is from the previous year . this is the ongoing work we 're doing to make sure that we make procurement better . when it comes to the management of this , it 's conducted by me and the minister of procurement . we are working toward making our procurement even better . we have already streamlined some aspects of our procurement and we 'll continue to do more as well . mr. james bezan : minister sajjan , you 've had this report since november of 2019 . you 've been rolling out this plan since 2017 . only three people are overseeing an expenditure of $ 553 billion . this is taxpayers ' money . are we going to see more cuts because you have been unable to actually roll out these dollars ? hon . harjit s. sajjan : madam chair , i can assure you we 're not going to be cutting . we 'll be investing in our defence . the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : before i go to the next speaker , i want to remind members that they are to address their questions and comments directly through the chair . we will go now to the honourable member for fort mcmurraycold lake , mr. yurdiga . mr. david yurdiga ( fort mcmurraycold lake , cpc ) : madam chair , the canada summer jobs program has many challenges . i 've seen many indigenous communities in my riding rejected for funding even though they had received funding in previous years . here are a few examples of communities that were rejected : beaver lake cree nation , buffalo lake mtis settlement and the mtis nation of alberta , region 1 . the list goes on . could the prime minister explain why so many indigenous communities have been denied funding from the canada summer jobs program ? hon . ahmed hussen : madam chair , we recognize the important role that the canada summer jobs program plays in supporting employers and young workers in our community across the country every year . we 're working very hard to help employers adapt to the realities of the covid-19 pandemic and are supporting young canadians as they begin to look for summer employment . we are introducing increased flexibilities into the canada summer jobs program to hire youth , while also providing more supports to employers that deliver essential services to canadians . mr. david yurdiga : madam chair , that did n't really answer my question . why are so many indigenous communities left out of the canada summer jobs program ? this is very important to my community and to communities throughout the province . will the government investigate why these communities were rejected ? hon . ahmed hussen : madam chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we , of course , value the important role that the canada summer jobs program plays in all communities , including indigenous communities in canada . i will certainly have an off-line conversation with the honourable member , if he so wishes , about a particular issue , but i can assure him that in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had to assist employers to introduce flexibilities the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : we will go back to mr. yurdiga . mr. david yurdiga : madam chair , in my riding , the city of cold lake has been in dispute with the federal government for many years over payment in lieu of taxes . my office has sent many letters over the years regarding the pilt dispute . could the minister of public services and procurement give me a rough estimate of when i will receive a response from the minister 's office to my first letter , from 2017 , and my letters from 2018 , 2019 and 2020 ? hon . david lametti : madam chair , i can assure the honourable member that i will go to the minister , and we will come back with an answer to his question . mr. david yurdiga : how much longer does the minister intend to perpetuate the ongoing pilt dispute , which is in excess of $ 11 million , with the city of cold lake ? hon . david lametti : madam chair , once again , i can assure the honourable member that i will speak with the minister and get an answer to his question . mr. david yurdiga : well , do you know what ? i 've been writing letters to the department for many years . when you say you 're going to get back to me , i really have a hard time believing that . will the minister agree to follow the prior recommendations of the dispute advisory panel that were accepted by the minister ? hon . david lametti : madam chair , i can assure the honourable member that i will check with the minister and that she will return to the member in due course . mr. david yurdiga : madam chair , the drug trikafta has been proven to increase the quality of life for 90 % of cystic fibrosis patients . two weeks ago , my office sent a letter to the minister of health about the boy in my riding named cael , who through the special access program is able to get trikafta in canada . i requested that the minister use her powers to fast-track trikafta for commercial use , but i have yet to receive a response back . when will the minister make a decision on trikafta ? hon . patty hajdu : madam chair , i 'm glad to hear that cael was able to access trikafta through the special access program . in fact , that program is very helpful for people who are seeking access to medication that 's not currently marketed in canada . as the member opposite knows , vertex has not applied to market trikafta in canada , but we look forward to their application , and i encourage him to write a letter to the manufacturer to also encourage them . the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : we will go now to the honourable member for vancouver granville , ms. wilson-raybould . hon . jody wilson-raybould ( vancouver granville , ind . ) : thank you , chair . i was very troubled to hear that a cbc radio host in the yukon felt compelled to resign because , as an indigenous person , she could not speak her truth . while we know the broadcasting act states that the canadian broadcasting system should reflect the linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature of canadian society and the special place of indigenous peoples , it would seem there are some challenges . therefore , does the minister of heritage share the concern of some journalists that problems of systemic racism in canada are still existing within the institution of the cbc , and will the government now acknowledge the need to recognize the jurisdiction of indigenous governments ? hon . steven guilbeault ( minister of canadian heritage ) : thank you , madame chair ; and i thank the member for this important question . as stated by the prime minister on numerous occasions , our government recognizes that systemic racism exists in canada , and we have made a commitment to do everything we can to combat it in whichever organization of the canadian government . hon . jody wilson-raybould : thank you . when i was in the government , and as a minister , i learned the term red meat issues . i understand these issues to be ones that challenge societal norms , that are not politically expedient to address because they can lose you votes , even though addressing them is morally right and a smart thing to do . mostly these are issues addressing inequality and the most marginalized in our society . in the justice system , examples include mandatory minimum penalties , defunding police , and even investing in restorative justice . red-meat issues often become defining issues for society and for governments as the world changes . surely now these issues are politically less of a consideration than the tragic reality of even more slain indigenous canadians at the hands of police , or thousands of indigenous people still incarcerated or living in poverty . will this government please finally commit to the necessary work originally promised in 2015 and repeal in the justice system the vast majority of mandatory minimum penalties , assuring the necessary discretion for judges , and meaningfully invest in restorative justice measures ? hon . david lametti : madame chair , i thank the honourable member for her question , as well as for her work as minister of justice , and indeed my predecessor . this is an important time . this is a time when we recognize systemic racism . this is a time when we recognize systemic over-incarceration of indigenous peoples , of black peoples , in our criminal justice system . this is a time when we need to look at all potential options to reduce what is a shameful overrepresentation in our criminal justice system . too often racialized peoples and indigenous peoples have experienced prejudice and systemic discrimination in our justice system , and that has to change . hon . jody wilson-raybould : i 'll go on to another red meat issue . in british columbia we are in the fifth year of the opioid overdose public health emergency crisis . sadly , may marks the deadliest month of overdose-related deaths . we are halfway into the year and have currently passed 500 deaths caused by overdose . many of the deaths are related to covid-19 measures that have prevented people from accessing supervised consumption sites , so they are overdosing alone . while the provinces welcomed the federal backing of safe supply exemption back in march , it is to expire in september of 2020 . echoing the call of the chief coroner of b.c . and dr. henry , more is needed from the federal government , more action . will the government provide the necessary supports to the province and help support safe supply initiatives in the provinces ? hon . patty hajdu : it 's been a pleasure to work with the province of british columbia on innovative ways to work on the tragic situation of opioid overdose . i remain committed to working with the province and in fact any province that wants to work towards solutions that treat people who use substances with the dignity they deserve . madam chair , this is a complex issue . we 're working closely with our partners to make sure that we can prevent more lives from being lost . the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : we will go to the honourable member for south okanaganwest kootenay , mr. cannings . mr. richard cannings ( south okanaganwest kootenay , ndp ) : thank you , madam chair . i 'll be splitting my time with the member for skeenabulkley valley . in my riding , theo 's in penticton is a beloved restaurant . they 've been serving great food for 40 years , but now they 're struggling , because they do n't qualify for the emergency wage subsidy . why is that ? the original owners retired last year and sold it to another operator . the new owner ca n't use a year-to-year comparison to apply for the wage subsidy because he did n't own the restaurant last spring . he is forced to use receipts from january and february , the darkest doldrums of the restaurant year , to compare with the results from may , traditionally one of their best months . now he has to compete with other local restaurants that can access the subsidy . when will the government fix this inequity and let theo 's compete and survive ? hon . mona fortier : madam chair , the canada emergency wage subsidy is supporting over 2.5 million workers across the country . to help even more businesses support their workers and rehire people as they reopen , our government is extending the cews , and we will continue to extend the cews for an additional 12 weeks to august 29 to ensure that canadian workers continue to have the support they need during these very difficult times . by extending eligibility , our government is ensuring that more canadian workers in more sectors have the support they need . mr. richard cannings : the owner just wants to be able to apply for the wage subsidy , and right now he can not , and he will not be able to . thousands of other businesses are hit that way as well . i 'd like to move on to forestry . canada 's forest sector has been declared essential during this pandemic , but it 's been hit hard after a very difficult 2019 . despite soft markets and thousands out of work , government support programs have left many canadian forest product companies behind . in my riding , the pulp mill in castlegar is closing for the month of july because local sawmills are n't producing enough wood chips . what is the government going to do to finally support canadian forestry workers and communities ? the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : the time is almost up , but i will allow for the answer from the honourable minister . hon . seamus o'regan : thank you , madam chair . we have supported and we will continue to support the forestry sector , including through regional development programs . in fact , in quebec , partnering with les bois francs dv inc. , we have widened market access to our products and updated technology systems . in north bay we 've partnered with the canadian wood council to promote the sector . in vancouver we 're working with fpinnovations to create the indigenous forest sector technical support program . we are supporting the forestry sector and its different needs region by region . the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : now we go to the honourable member for skeenabulkley valley , mr. bachrach . mr. taylor bachrach ( skeenabulkley valley , ndp ) : thank you , madam chair . i 'm going to pick up where my colleague left off , with b.c . 's forest industry . what we 've seen in b.c . are multiple rounds of mill shutdowns and start-ups , and in some cases this has made it difficult for forestry workers to qualify for ei . my question to the minister is this : will the minister work to make the ei program more flexible for forestry workers , similar to what this government has done for oil and gas workers ? hon . seamus o'regan : madam chair , in the oil and gas sector we have focused on workers . that has been key in the inactive and orphan well program , which we are working on with the provincial governments of saskatchewan , british columbia and alberta . the focus on workers has assured that success , and we will continue to focus on workers in all the industries , particularly our natural resource industry , as they go through this extraordinarily difficult time . mr. taylor bachrach : madam chair , reforestation is a very important part of the forest industry in the riding i represent , and people were keenly interested to hear this government 's plan to plant two billion trees in the next 10 years . that 's a lot of trees . i 'm wondering if the minister could tell us how many trees are going to be planted under this program by the end of this season . hon . seamus o'regan : madam chair , this government is committed to two billion trees . we are working with forestry associations , the industry and with individual companies to ensure this tree-planting season will be one of the largest the country has ever seen . the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : the floor goes to the honourable member for rivire-du-nord . mr. rhal fortin ( rivire-du-nord , bq ) : madamchair , last week , the government introduced billc-17 and the minister of justice sent us briefing notes in which he said that it was important to suspend a number of time limits and to extend others , and that the failure to do so could have important repercussions on canadians , their families , their situations , their finances and their ability to exercise their rights . we in the bloc qubcois agree with that . when are we going to talk about it ? hon . david lametti : madamchair , the contents of billc-17 are clearly very important . we have addressed the mandatory time limits in federal legislation as well as certain time limits that courts may not be able to handle . it is very important that we address this issue . that is why the law the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : mr.fortin , you have the floor . mr. rhal fortin : madamchair , we agree that it is important . i concur . the minister 's briefing notes say that , among other things , when it comes to divorcewhich means children are involved people are waiting on custody rights , child support and visitation rights . the minister pointed out that the national security review would require consultations if no decision is made in the prescribed time frame . it could pose a national security risk . it is really a big deal . when are we going to debate it ? hon . david lametti : madamchair , i completely agree with my honourable colleague . the issue needs to be addressed . that is why it is in the bill . that is another reason to debate the bill . i beseech my colleagues opposite to debate it with us . mr. rhal fortin : madamchair , what a coincidence , because i beseech my colleague opposite to debate it with us . that is what we are asking . last week , the leader of the bloc qubcois asked the liberal government to debate billc-17 today . he did not get an answer . it does not seem to matter . richard wagner , the chief justice of the supreme court , who is hardly a dimwit or greenhorn , told us that the justice system needs to be modernized . as recently as this past saturday in lapresse , justice wagner said that it is essential that the criminal code be amended to address the backlog of court proceedings . when will the liberal government opposite pull up its socks , do its job , govern the federation , sit down with the opposition and discuss the vital matters in billc-17 ? hon . pablo rodriguez : madamchair , if i were my colleague , i would be a little embarrassed , because the bill was sent to the bloc qubcois several days in advance . they received a technical note several days in advance . we were all available to take questions . when we asked for the support of the bloc qubcois and the other parties to debate itwe were not even asking them to vote in favour of the billthey refused . mr. rhal fortin : madamchair , we never refused to debate it . actually , we were the ones who asked to debate it . what exactly does debate it mean ? we set some conditions . for example , we asked the liberals to put the money back into the wage subsidy fund and to commit to dip into it no longer . are we asking too much of our colleagues opposite ? hon . pablo rodriguez : can my colleague explain to me what the emergency wage subsidy has to do with a bill about justice ? this is an absolutely fundamental piece of legislation . we wanted to debate it , but they refused to do so . mr. rhal fortin : madamchair , i would like nothing better than to explain it to him , but i must remind him that he is the leader of the party in power , the party that is supposed to govern the country . so i do not know why he is asking me that . my party proposed that we debate this today but we did not get an answer . meanwhile , court time limits are running out and people are losing rights . i am thinking of families , child support , child custody , labour law disputes in federal court , marine transportation , interprovincial transportation , aviation , banks , and those with grievances waiting for a federal court ruling . the whole system , the supreme court and the court of appeal , everything is on hold because nobody in the government wants to do their job . we want to discuss billc-17 . when can we talk about it ? hon . pablo rodriguez : madamchair , we have done our job . we have introduced the bill . we informed them in advance . we told them they could ask us any questions they wanted . we asked for a debate in the house . however , when we asked the bloc qubcois if they wanted to debate the bill , they said no , instead of doing what they usually do and saying yes . the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : we will go to the honourable member for essex , mr. lewis . mr. chris lewis ( essex , cpc ) : thank you , madam chair . when the cerb runs out , many workers in my riding of essex will not have sufficient hours to collect their ei benefits . in early july , the midnight shift at chrysler will be eliminated . because of the shutdown , a mom-to-be who had just returned to work in january , and several hundred of her fellow employees , may not have the 600 hours required for regular or ei parental benefits . immediate action is needed . what is the government doing now to backstop these workers ? hon . ahmed hussen : madam chair , the canada emergency response benefit has been providing much-needed help to canadian workers across the country who have stopped working due to covid-19 . we know that there is still a lot of uncertainty for many canadian workers , and we know that many will be exhausting their benefits in the weeks to come . we will have more to share soon , as early as this week , on our continuing efforts to support canadian workers and make sure that help is available during this the acting chair ( mrs. carol hughes ) : go ahead , mr. lewis . mr. chris lewis : thank you , minister , for the answer . the ei system needs to be fixed . even before the shutdown , the system was deeply flawed . will this government commit to a complete review and overhaul of the ei system ?"
