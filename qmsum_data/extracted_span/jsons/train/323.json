    "answer": "project manager : uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . which i think is quite tricky . industrial designer : marketing : um , basically we 're trying to get people to buy a remote control user interface : yeah . marketing : would n't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? user interface : project manager : of course they have already one . so our our our remote control has to be better . marketing : but it 's not going to have more functionality , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : 'cause it 's only a low market , it 's a cheap-end remote control , we ca n't beat modern functionality , we might we 'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that 's not a big seller , if they 're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so i 'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing . project manager : mm . i well i think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh r_c_ is is important when they are buying one marketing : mm . yeah . but why are they buying one in the first place ? project manager : but indeed . so that will be about functionality marketing : mm . but if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they 'll buy a universal remote . i 've got friends who 've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they 're using five different remotes for their all their things . project manager : mm . mm-hmm . mm . marketing : in that case they would n't buy our product , because it does n't give them what they need in terms of functionality . project manager : so your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance marketing : well , we ca n't , with the price range . we we 're not building a universal remote , we 're not building a high end product . project manager : what do what do you think about what componen industrial designer : yeah we have yeah twelve point five euros uh per uh per r_ s r_c_ and i think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh we can include it in our control some new new features . yeah . and um but yeah marketing : but yeah . if we 're getting into universal remote territory , we 're getting to lcd screens and things like that industrial designer : that 's marketing : which would drive the cost up a lot . project manager : i do n't know . i do n't know whether that 's necessary . is the lcd screen marketing : for universal remotes industrial designer : i do n't think lcd is not necessary well , th for long term . marketing : if you mm . project manager : i think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive . marketing : and quite complicated to use , project manager : s so we can try to go in between , and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated marketing : mm-hmm . not as flexible maybe , yeah , but s industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh r_c_ industrial designer : universal . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : marketing : but if we 're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own tvs to use a remote control on . project manager : mm yes but w we 're targeting i think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . marketing : okay . so they 're yeah . project manager : people yes . who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . yep . i do n't know really what the the price range for remote controls is . are we gon na be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? i do n't know . project manager : uh well i think uh when we think it over i thi i think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . industrial designer : marketing : mm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so d do you agree ? user interface : well well i it 's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive . industrial designer : yeah user interface : uh and it d uh our provin industrial designer : because we have to take into account that we are gon na b we are gon na sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is uh price of a chip is very cheap . so i 'm okay for designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh r_c_ yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . you think it 's possible for the twelve euro fifty ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control . user interface : uh yeah , that 's that 's what we needed basically . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm . mm . okay . user interface : uh that 's needed right now . and uh basically you can look to the standards of other industrial designer : yeah that 's needed , yeah . marketing : mm . yeah . industrial designer : and if we want to get the market , we really need that . marketing : yeah . so i guess what i 'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , v_c_r_ and tv . industrial designer : yes . exactly . user interface : yeah . marketing : and just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . user interface : yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . industrial designer : is that okay for you ? yeah . project manager : mm mm mm mm . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : so given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content user interface : okay . okay . project manager : and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market . marketing : mm-hmm yep . user interface : voila . hmm . project manager : so anyone uh has a point to bring in user interface : so . well . project manager : or shall we no . user interface : oh i do n't have anything right now . we can we 'll we 'll go project manager : okay . industrial designer : that 's that 's fine then . user interface : and we 'll i 'm sure we 'll up something good marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : w yes , user interface : for the project manager : we uh we can have lunch now . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so um then th th the next meeting will uh user interface : yeah so we meet in well what are our project manager : after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting . but you will be informed via the computer . user interface : okay . project manager : okay . user interface : cool . so see you later ."
