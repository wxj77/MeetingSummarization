    "query": "<s> summarize what was said about digits form",
    "answer": "grad d : no , i spoke with jane about that and we sort of decided that it 's probably not an issue that we edit out any of the errors anyway . right ? so the there are no errors in the digits , professor f : yeah . grad d : you 'll always read the string correctly . so i ca n't imagine why anyone would care . so the other topic with digits is uh , liz would like to elicit different prosodics , and so we tried last week with them written out in english . and it just did n't work at all because no one grouped them together . so it just sounded like many many more lines instead of anything else . so in conversations with liz and uh jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number , social security number - like readings . the problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits . when i look at this , that first line is `` sixty one , sixty two , eighteen , eighty six , ten . `` um , and so the question is does anyone care ? um , i 've already spoken with liz and she feels that , correct me if i 'm wrong , that for her , connected numbers is fine , postdoc e : mm - hmm . grad d : as opposed to connected digits . um , i think two hours is probably fine for a test set , but it may be a little short if we actually wan na do training and adaptation and all that other stuff . professor f : yeah um , do um you want different prosodics , so if you always had the same groupings you would n't like that ? is that correct ? phd g : well , we actually figured out a way to grad d : yeah , the the phd g : the the groupings are randomly generated . professor f : no but , i was asking if that was something you really cared about because if it was n't , it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people would n't , uh , go and do numbers so much . you know if it if it 's phd a : uh phd g : i think they may still do it , um , professor f : maybe some , but i probably not so much . phd b : what about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group ? phd g : and professor f : right ? so if you if if you have uh grad d : six dash one , you mean ? professor f : if you go six six six uh dash uh two nine three one . phd g : i well ok i it might help , i would like to g get away from having only one specific grouping . professor f : that 's what i was asking , yeah . phd g : um , so if that 's your question , professor f : yeah . phd g : but i mean it seems to me that , at least for us , we can learn to read them as digits postdoc e : yeah . phd g : if that 's what people want . i i 'm postdoc e : yeah . phd g : do n't think that 'd be that hard to read them as single digits . postdoc e : i agree . phd g : um , and it seems like that might be better for you guys since then you 'll have just more digit data , grad d : right . phd g : and that 's always a good thing . it 's a little bit better for me too because the digits are easier to recognize . they 're better trained than the numbers . grad d : so we could just , uh , put in the instructions `` read them as digits `` . professor f : right . phd g : right . right , read them as single digits , so sixty - one w is read as six one , postdoc e : mm - hmm . phd g : and if people make a mistake we grad d : how about `` o `` versus `` zero `` ? professor f : i mean , the other thing is we could just bag it because it 's it 's it 's - i 'm not worrying about it i mean , because we do have digits training data that we have from uh from ogi . i 'm sorry , digits numbers training that we have from ogi , we 've done lots and lots of studies with that . and um . phd g : but it 's nice to get it in this room with the acous professor f : yeah . phd g : i mean for it 's professor f : no , no , i guess what i 'm saying is that grad d : just let them read it how they read it . professor f : to some extent maybe we could just read them have them read how how they read it and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have . phd g : right . well that 's fine with me as long as it 's just that i did n't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits . professor f : yeah . we can go back to the other thing later . phd g : so professor f : i mean we s we we 've we can do this for awhile and then go back to digits for awhile , or um . do yo i mean , do you want do you want this do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ? how much of this do you need ? with uh the phd g : it 's actually unclear right now . i just thought well we 're if we 're collec collecting digits , and adam had said we were running out of the ti forms , i thought it 'd be nice to have them in groups , and probably , all else being equal , it 'd be better for me to just have single digits since it 's , you know , a recognizer 's gon na do better on those anyway , um , and it 's more predictable . so we can know from the transcript what the person said and the transcriber , in general . professor f : ok , well if you pre phd g : but if they make mistakes , it 's no big deal if the people say a hundred instead of `` one oo `` . and also w maybe we can just let them choose `` zero `` versus `` o `` as they as they like because even the same person c sometimes says `` o `` and sometimes says `` zero `` in different context , professor f : yeah . phd g : and that 's sort of interesting . so i do n't have a specific need cuz if i did i 'd probably try to collect it , you know , without bothering this group , but if we can try it grad d : ok so so i can just add to the instructions to read it as digits not as connected numbers . postdoc e : mm - hmm . phd g : right , and you can give an example like , you know , `` six sixty - one would be read as six one `` . grad d : right . postdoc e : mm - hmm . and i actually it 's no more artificial than what we 've been doing with words . phd g : and i think people will get it . postdoc e : i 'm sure people can adapt to this , read it single . phd g : right , right . postdoc e : the spaces already bias it toward being separated . phd g : it 's just easier to read . postdoc e : and i know i 'm gon na find this easier than words ."
