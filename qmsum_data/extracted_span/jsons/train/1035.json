    "answer": "industrial designer : project manager : um almost , there 's one more thing i have to get out of the i have to make sure that this attachment will open . industrial designer : i keep forgetting whether i 've done this . . project manager : ah-ha . okay . we 'll open that when the time is right . in the meantime closing things down , okay . let 's see what this thing does . does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? ah , we came up together , we 're good . okay . are we ready to start ? okay . it 's now quarter of four . this is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . okay . right . our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um sarah present the evaluation criteria . we then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an excel spreadsheet . and i know what you 're all thinking of , oh my , um because we 're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . so we 're going to make a very fast track . okay . um and as you can see that 's what we do next on this thing . so the first thing i have to do is close this so that i can get to where is it ? i need to open mine . not the agenda . marketing : agenda three . project manager : no that th i want the minutes from the previous minutes . that should be there , minutes . yeah . okay . uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if i do n't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 'cause this way i can more easily flip it . okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations . um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . the market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . um we decided chip on print would be used . um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , i think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . there was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . um looking like a scroll , but it 's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . and uh we closed as it ran out of time . is that a fair presentation of what happened ? okay , back to this meeting . um we 're down to the prototype presentation . industrial designer : ta-da . user interface : alright . project manager : over to you . industrial designer : right . user interface : well . project manager : ooh , two . user interface : yeah , well you see , each made one , we did n't have enough yellow dough . industrial designer : user interface : this is the one that i made . project manager : uh-huh . user interface : it is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . this is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus . of course we need someone who 's experienced with the television . i mean this is the infrared thing that 's gon na zap at the television . uh i 'm not quite sure how to make that , but i 'm sure it will work . uh this is on off switch , 'cause i think we do need that , and i think it gives it a nice balance . project manager : 'kay . user interface : and it 's gon na have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . project manager : okay . user interface : um as for what it 's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus . project manager : okay . user interface : uh position , i presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . the main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . right ? form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold . uh material , i think kate 's gon na tackle that quite a bit , but i think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it 's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . project manager : user interface : also with on off switch and infrared uh i had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . so like uh well , i dunno , what 's it like ? i guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . whereas otherwise we 'd thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gon na see what you thought , the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . so we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . and what we well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . uh material yeah , that 's what i have to say about material . can i scroll down on there and see what else industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : well colour , i think i definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that 's the company colours , but if anybody 's got any other suggestions , i 'm quite willing to consider them as well . so , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if i 'm yeah , maybe , kate , you better say what you think about them . industrial designer : um well i do n't have very much to add . um the the case oops , that 's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . user interface : industrial designer : the the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . we 're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . we have the technology to do that . um and as for the the actual components um , uh steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . we have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it 's the stalk of the banana , or it 's just the thing at the end of this version . um so that 's for material . colour , well uh steph 's the expert on colour . um we we do n't have any particular restrictions on that . yeah , i think that 's all we 've got to say really . user interface : i thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , i guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . industrial designer : a banana . user interface : this one has n banana , yeah . this one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it 's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it 's more like yeah , you 'd expect it to be like a child 's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which i quite like that sort of image . 'cause it 's very big and chunky and child-friendly and industrial designer : would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? user interface : hold them , you see , you know . curvature , is it to your liking ? project manager : oh i see , the on-off 's in the back . industrial designer : yes , that 's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . user interface : if you do n't wan na tire out your thumbs after all . project manager : and then you can use your thumb . industrial designer : and it was partly we thought the design looked better , user interface : yeah . project manager : i could see this thing , unless it 's reinforced , having a problem with the you know user interface : breaking , project manager : yeah . user interface : oh right . well you see , that 's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it 'd just be rigid . marketing : i like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . user interface : yeah , we really like we really like that design , marketing : it 's really kind of a user interface : i mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . like a c like a compass point , you know , marketing : mm-hmm mm-hmm . user interface : just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . and it 's like the the ipod scroll wheel , but better . marketing : yeah . but it 's also like texting , user interface : yeah . yeah , yeah , marketing : you do n't user interface : i mean it that 's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , marketing : industrial designer : user interface : i was try i was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? industrial designer : and it 's a very simple design , marketing : yeah . user interface : it 's texting . industrial designer : there 's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make . marketing : it 's also in terms of um being lost it 's it 's quite it looks quite different . you know , i i d i have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to user interface : yeah . marketing : you know , this is really identifiable . user interface : i mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of i mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gon na appear at the bottom of the screen , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : but we do definitely think that it 's a viable option . project manager : okay . the next item is evaluation . marketing : no , okay . project manager : uh if that 's if you 're finished . user interface : uh yeah , we 're finished . marketing : um industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : shall i take your uh power ? project manager : oh sorry . try again . marketing : okay . this is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . so , this means we 're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . so i 'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and i 've made a list of criteria to look at , and so i 'm gon na i 'm gon na leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it 's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and i 'm gon na now use the um the board . okay . so um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . and in fact i hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , user interface : yeah , what about price , is that gon na go on there as well ? price of materials . marketing : like they overlap . mm , yeah , price . we 'll put price up at the top . user interface : not that we actually know anything about it , industrial designer : user interface : but we can we can pretend . marketing : project manager : well we will soon , unfortunately . marketing : um okay , so project manager : come on . marketing : did you say ? project manager : no , . marketing : uh okay , so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? user interface : it depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when i think of fancy , i think of it 's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and which marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i 'd call these quite uh minimalist , industrial designer : yes , a plain , simple , clean design . user interface : simple and plain , but i mean i do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : so in that respect it is quite fancy . marketing : i yeah , so in that respect i think we 'll go with that respect . user interface : i think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , i 'd say maybe aesthetic . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : well we have got s trendy further down , project manager : elegant . industrial designer : but project manager : elegant . marketing : elegant . industrial designer : elegant , i do n't know if i 'd call them elegant . marketing : yeah , no these are n't the exact terms that the um user interface : like stylish or aesthetic . industrial designer : stylish , yeah . marketing : yeah . elegant . we 're gon let 's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is user interface : fancy . marketing : yeah . n that um user interface : did you just break the pen ? project manager : marketing : yeah uh the uh is fancy . so let 's let 's take it to the next level . user interface : well d we 'll just call it fancy then . marketing : well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . we 'll call it e_f_ um , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? should we go with the yellow in terms of i think that 's a really superior user interface : yeah , i think we n we need to marketing : they 're both user interface : they 're both yellow with black buttons , it 's just that we did n't have any more dough to represent uh that , marketing : yeah . user interface : but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . marketing : yeah . user interface : so what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two marketing : yeah . user interface : that is n't that is more curved , like a banana , but that is n't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , marketing : as a banana . i think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we 'll call it the banana . project manager : yeah . marketing : and of the two i really like i m i like the banana , project manager : the chunk . marketing : but i i do like the chunk . user interface : so that 's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it . just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . marketing : but i mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them . unless do you guys wan na evaluate both ? project manager : i think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . industrial designer : yeah , i 'd project manager : it 's more true than false , about a two . marketing : okay . so we say true . technologically innovative . user interface : industrial designer : i d i do n't think that 's what we 're aiming at with this concept . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think we 're using simple components that are gon na be robust but not particularly innovative . marketing : so we 'll say we 'll say uh false . easy to use . industrial designer : very . marketing : one , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : is that inappropriate ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . oh , pardon me . um project manager : trendy . user interface : oh yes . marketing : trendy , s and i say specifically spongy fruity . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it 's no we still have n't decided about specific sponginess or specific industrial designer : we have the worry about how robust it will be if it 's it 's curved as a banana but spongy . i think user interface : yeah , i do n't really think that 's gon na work , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but marketing : okay , so two ? um industrial designer : yeah . project manager : excess buttons . marketing : are there excess buttons ? that is false . industrial designer : so that 's false . marketing : um good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . project manager : better , more intuitive buttons , yes . marketing : true . ugly . user interface : no . marketing : people do n't respond well to ugly . sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people industrial designer : yeah , i think they 're different , are n't they ? user interface : well it is quite it is quite quirky i think . marketing : like oh , project manager : i like it . marketing : yeah . yeah , i do too . user interface : it could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . marketing : oh yeah . and i was i was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it 's cost saving ? with the user interface : oh , we also need tho think about the energy . is it the kinetic energy ? marketing : yeah , with the energy . industrial designer : mm . user interface : if it 's it is gon na be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it is going to be kinetic ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : we 'll c we 'll say it 's a cost saving enviro . yeah , uh so yes . user interface : yeah , but we have n't completely developed that side of it yet , so we 're not completely sure about that , marketing : well user interface : but yeah . marketing : you 're still in the play-doh stage . user interface : yeah . marketing : anything else ? including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? industrial designer : well i think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . we have n't got a lot of expensive components in there . project manager : yes , the instinct says true . marketing : okay . so true one or should i go to two or three ? industrial designer : i 'd put it at one i think , but i dunno , what do you user interface : i would say maybe a two , marketing : okay . user interface : 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . industrial designer : yeah , true , user interface : i mean it 's not just like i mean it 's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res i mean means something different , project manager : yeah , that 's not a cheap thing to get . industrial designer : it might be the yeah , yeah , true . true . user interface : whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you 're in . industrial designer : yeah , that 's a good point . user interface : uh we need somebody to develop that . marketing : um other ? anything else you guys can thing of ? and i 'm gon na actually change a couple of these so then i 'm gon na instead of ugly i 'm gon na say it 's attractive and then make that true , so that user interface : yeah . marketing : 'cause i have to do an average . industrial designer : right . marketing : and then um excess buttons . user interface : just putting no excess buttons . marketing : exactly . wow we 're doing really well . yeah , be you know , user interface : as for marketing : so it does n't ruin the polarity . user interface : see if we 're technologically innovative , i 'd say it is quite innovative , because there are n't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i mean i know we 're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . marketing : or lcd . yeah . well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think i should change the innovative or add other features . if not i 'll average those . project manager : i think we 're good . marketing : okay . mm . project manager : okay . we 're a little over halfway through the meeting marketing : so project manager : and the next big thing is the finance . okay . marketing : um okay , how about if i uh pass this back to you and i 'll uh figure out the average here . project manager : right . marketing : thank you for everyone 's help with that . project manager : right . and as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank goodness . and we 're going to raise what 's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . user interface : project manager : hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . okay . user interface : well , just kinetic then , . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um what 's a hand dynamo ? industrial designer : that was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . user interface : it 's the wind-up . marketing : project manager : shoot , forget that . kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one . industrial designer : just one . project manager : okay . electronic simple chip on print , and we 'll need one of those . industrial designer : uh uh yeah , i think we can do it all with simple just checking that . yeah , simple , 'cause we 've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest . project manager : okay , and we only need one of those . okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . it looks like it single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . it 's industrial designer : yeah , that that one is single curve , project manager : that 's uh uh one . industrial designer : is n't it ? um do we have project manager : and that 's user interface : what does double curved mean , i do n't understand . industrial designer : i i think you it means you reverse the curve . project manager : uh that 's the the one that goes like this . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , i do i do n't think we need that for either of them , user interface : oh no , we do n't need that . no . project manager : right . industrial designer : you can do a banana in single curve , user interface : single-curved , i 'd say . project manager : single curve . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay , case material supplements . plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . industrial designer : user interface : i just wan na say plastic . project manager : we had the special colour . and did we say plastic ? industrial designer : yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i mean i i still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , marketing : one , two , three , four , five , six . industrial designer : but it depends on the cost , i guess . project manager : okay . we 'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that 's where we are . interface button push button interface . that 's what we 're using , user interface : it 's just button . yeah . project manager : is n't it ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : do we need to say how many buttons , or project manager : whoops , do n't want that , not yet . um industrial designer : or d is it just one ? project manager : no , it just says push button interface . button supplements , they 'll be in a special colour of black . industrial designer : 'kay . project manager : and the buttons wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? industrial designer : uh they 'll be rubber , yep . project manager : so we need one of them . and are they any special form ? user interface : well yeah , like the compass point one . industrial designer : actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'cause i think they can be plastic . project manager : 'cause the rate we 're going we can put the rubber on top . industrial designer : yeah . they could be plastic , we do n't have to have rubber buttons , because we have n't got a double curved case . user interface : yeah , they could be plastic . project manager : okay . um let 's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . industrial designer : it 's just one , is n't it ? project manager : uh we only need one of them . um and the total cost has been calculated as nine pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . industrial designer : what , we 're in . marketing : yeah . project manager : we 're in . that 's us . industrial designer : more profit . user interface : great . project manager : okay , i 'm going to save this into our desktop , project documents . okay . as our project document bit . industrial designer : do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? project manager : yeah . there we are . that 's the only excel document that will be in there , so it 's there for all of us . okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . right . um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . yeah , leadership , teamwork , user interface : yeah . marketing : sure . yes . project manager : means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . marketing : user interface : and play-doh . project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , the play-doh was best , i thought . project manager : user interface : yeah well , 'cause i mean it 's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . so much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . industrial designer : yep . project manager : okay . so , we went over all those things and we 're satisfied with all the above . um did we find any new ideas ? marketing : i think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped i i mean i that really opened my eyes . user interface : yeah . spongy . marketing : i i only speak for myself though . user interface : and i 'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so . good work as a design team , industrial designer : yeah , i think we 're a good team actually . user interface : because we industrial designer : i 'm not sure all the wires are really great though . project manager : so we actually worked well as a group . industrial designer : i thought so . project manager : right . are the costs within the budget ? yes . user interface : oh yes . project manager : is the project evaluated ? marketing : i can give you a number , industrial designer : hang on , oh we have n't heard . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : um it 's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , i can i can spell it out . there were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine we 're between one and two . i would say that 's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . user interface : yeah . and the the only false one is because we 've chosen to keep a simple old technology , marketing : to maintain old technology , exactly . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : which if it works perfectly well i see no point in improving on if it works , marketing : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : absolutely , and it 's kept us within budget . user interface : so . yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so we do count as i think excellent or one . project manager : alright . user interface : . project manager : and we 've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , i have a final report to present , um and then we 're done . marketing : okay . project manager : we done good , and we 're finished in time . user interface : bring on the ice sculptures . marketing : nice . industrial designer : and then we get the product launch party . marketing : so we might have to wait . industrial designer : product launch party ? user interface : yeah . project manager : user interface : that 's what i said , ice sculptures . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : absolutely . marketing : um i one thing i want to do is oh , i think the meeting 's done . project manager : i believe that is the end of our meeting . thank you , melissa ."
