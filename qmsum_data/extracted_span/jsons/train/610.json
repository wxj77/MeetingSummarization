    "answer": "mr. dane lloyd : i note that the minister could n't name a single example of government support for carbon capture , utilization and sequestration technology . we have spent a lot of time talking about the covid-19 pandemic , but canadians are living with another horrific reality , that being the intensifying opioid overdose epidemic . reports indicate that in the past four years , 14,000 canadians have died , and the numbers during covid-19 have been skyrocketing , with british columbia seeing a 39 % increase this year alone . i know this because i 've lost a family member to a fentanyl overdose . when is the government going to take this scourge seriously and take action to save the lives of canadians ?"
