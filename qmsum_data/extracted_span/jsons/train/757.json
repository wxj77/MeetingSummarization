    "query": "<s> other than fee and access reports , what else do executives do to assure that welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning for brexit ?",
    "answer": "mark reckless am : you mentioned the fee and access report . what else do you do to assure yourselves that welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning for brexit ? bethan owen : we 've touched on contingency plans , but , in an environment of uncertainty , i think it 's difficult for any of us to know what the right scenario is . i think rather than looking at worst-case scenarios , what the sector is also focusing on is the promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding . so , we touched on strengthening the global wales engagement in order to sell wales , so more focus on marketing wales overseas , but also within the uk . the other area where the sector is working at a uk level very hard is making the arguments to uk government for maintaining access to the successor to horizon 2020 , which is arguably a larger part of the whole funding infrastructure\u2014students is one part , but the whole funding infrastructure for maintaining research capacity . so , working with uk universities to make arguments at uk government level for maintaining access to those sources of funding is also a part of what the institutions are doing . we mentioned the welsh government 's he brexit group . that group , which is the welsh government group , is being advised by members on it , and that 's informing welsh government officials when they engage with uk government as well . mark reckless am : do universities seek your advice on what the risks and , indeed , opportunities of brexit may be and what you think they should be doing to plan for them , or is your role more one of monitoring what they do as opposed to advising what they should do ?"
