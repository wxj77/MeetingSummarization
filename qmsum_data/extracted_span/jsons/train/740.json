    "answer": "phd e : yeah . professor b : uh . but , um . yeah , the other thing is that even though it 's months away , uh , it 's starting to seem to me now like november fifteenth is right around the corner . and , um , if they have n't decided things like this , like what the parameters are gon na be for this , uh , when `` deciding `` is not just somebody deciding . i mean , in fact there should be some understanding behind the , uh , deciding , which means some experiments and and so forth . it it it seems pretty tight to me . phd e : so wha what 's the significance of november fifteenth ? professor b : that 's when the evaluation is . yeah . so , yeah , so after but , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off . it would n't , you know , entirely surprise me . but , uh , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , i 'm i 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for a l a long while . that would be , uh put us in an awkward position . but anyway . great . yeah , i think that 'll be helpful . there 's there 's not anybody ogi currently who 's who 's , uh , working with this and and phd e : is is this part of the evaluation just a small part , or ho how important is this to the overall ? professor b : i i think it 's it 's , um it depends how badly you do . i mean , i think that it it is uh . phd e : this is one of those things that will be debated afterwards ? professor b : yeah . well , i mean , it 's it 's conceptually , it my impression , again , you guys correct me if i 'm wrong , but my impression is that , um , they want it as a double check . that you have n't come across you have n't invented features which are actually gon na do badly for a a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary . and , um , but it 's not the main emphasis . i mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary . so it 's it 's a double check . so they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight ."
