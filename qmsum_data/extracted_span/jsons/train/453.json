    "query": "<s> how do the group think of the extent and condition that schools actually make good use of that funding of pdg ?",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : thank you . if we can go on , then , to talk about some of the practical uses of the pdg , you write in your written paper that 'the majority of schools are making well thought out and appropriate decisions ' on how to use it . but estyn reported that only two thirds of primary and secondary schools make effective use of the pdg . given that we 've had it now for six years , would you not have expected there to be a higher level of schools actually making good use of that funding ? kirsty williams am : well , to flip it on its head , the vast majority of schools , as identified by estyn , are using this money to good effect . so , that 's the way i like to see it\u2014that the vast majority of schools are doing well . what estyn has also indicated is the intrinsic link here to leadership within individual schools , and as you 'll be aware , leadership , improving capacity in leadership and developing leadership talent in the welsh education system is a key priority for me in our national mission . of course , that 's being developed in a different work stream . i think what 's fair to say is that the use of pdg is evolving over time . i think we are seeing , increasingly , more and more schools understanding how best to deploy that money for best effect for students . so , if we 're honest , when pdg first started , i think , in some schools it was spent on investing in tracking of children , because they 'd never thought about tracking these children , they did n't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children , and to have a system in place . so we 've moved now from spending money on the infrastructure around support for fsm children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning . we 're also seeing from estyn that , actually , in terms of money following the evidence of what we know works , estyn says that pdg is probably the best example of schools following tried and tested and evidence-based interventions to deploy the money . but clearly we want all of this money to be deployed as well as it can be , and again we come back to the decision i 've made to appoint regional pdg advisers so that we can get that better consistency of approach . we are , in the discussions that i have with the regional consortia about how they challenge individual schools on usage , looking for very clear evidence of schools using the sutton trust toolkit , and we could have a discussion about whether that 's the right thing , because that 's on my mind too . but we want to see schools demonstrating their evidence base , and if they 're not , if a school is n't doing that , okay , so demonstrate to us why you 've made those decisions and , crucially , what are you doing as the school to judge whether that decision is actually making a difference for your individual pupils . so , if you 're moving away from tried and tested interventions , what we know works , if you 're doing something different with your money , okay , you need to justify that and you need to explain how you 're going to demonstrate impact . but i think what we 're seeing is increasing good practice in this area as the pdg develops and as our understanding of our school-to-school working in our self-improving school system also develops . i think we 're seeing better usage of the money year on year ."
