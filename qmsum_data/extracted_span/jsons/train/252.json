marketing : and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups , project manager : 'kay . so they have team elements . industrial designer : marketing : do you have a favourite one ? project manager : i 'm afraid i 'm with steph . and i think your pen 's running out of whatever . but i 'm afraid i take the coward 's way out , and the cat 's looking the other way . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : he 's hiding . marketing : project manager : um cats are sometimes very independent . my parents had cats . uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . okay . now um we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we 're to sell it for twenty five euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million euros . that tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . um the production is to only cost twelve and a half euros per item . now if they cost twelve and a half , you 're selling it for twenty five , you 're making twelve and a half euros each . um and we 're to make a profit of fifty million , that 's t uh can you do the maths and how many are we selling ? marketing : uh yeah . i was just wondering if that 's the um if fifty percent is normal project manager : mark-up ? marketing : b yeah . um i would think would be more like sixty percent . but um let me project manager : okay . marketing : i have two thoughts . one hundred , fifty percent . and and your question is how many do we have to sell ? project manager : yes , 'cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know , you got ta know how many we 're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . marketing : at twenty five . mm-hmm . yeah , that 's um project manager : to give you a pretty good idea of where you 're looking . marketing : so that 's four million of them ? project manager : something like that ? okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : that 's fifty million euros . in order to make fifty million euros , and you 're only getting twelve and a half each marketing : and if we make mm-hmm . project manager : that 's a lot of selling . two four marketing : yeah . four million . project manager : to be fifty , be four million . you 'd have to sell four million . okay ? right . experience with a remote control . any of you use of remote control for a television or d_v_d_ or something ? you 're both nodding , industrial designer : that that that 's the sorta product we 're talking about , one that will work for a in a home environment , for a tvs and marketing : yeah . project manager : all three . well i 've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but i also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . user interface : it is true that you always sit around you know , you 're sitting on your sofa and you wan na change something , there 's five different remotes , and one for the d_v_d_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . industrial designer : marketing : mm-hmm . y yeah . project manager : and they do n't always talk to each other . user interface : but i presume this is t i presume this is just for television . project manager : do n't know . okay . marketing : project manager : are there any um ideas for the remote ? what would it be for and what group would be be for ? we have to think about that one . marketing : we could make a hello kitty industrial designer : marketing : themed remote . project manager : user interface : i think one in b bright colours would be good . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think one that works would be good . marketing : we could totally go for the japan-a-mation . well i mean there 's also the cachet that um uh the japanese make great products . electrical their industrial design is very good . user interface : i think one that does n't have lots of superfluous functions . like i 've got one at home that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , marketing : yeah . user interface : you know , subtitles , mute , there 's a lotta buttons that i 've got no idea what they do , like . project manager : marketing : well , that 's a really good point , project manager : okay . marketing : because i think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it 's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . we do n't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down . project manager : mm . okay . marketing : mm . we can make it smart like an ipod , you know , make everything menus . user interface : ooh , closing the meeting . project manager : yeah . um i know this sounds like it was very quick , user interface : that was quick . project manager : but the i think that 's the industrial design is the first one , that 's kate , for the working design . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : and user , that 's you s steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . i think there 's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and i think we all , you know , we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but i think we all have to like each other um to get this done . uh as it says , we 're gon na get individual instructions , but uh i do n't think they allowed a lot of extra time , so i think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . do you all agree ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : alright . um then i do n't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . alright , so this is the end of the first meeting . marketing : okay . industrial designer : 'kay ."
