    "query": "<s> summarize their discussions on the amendments related to the duty to report on the effect of the legislation .",
    "answer": "lynne neagle am : thank you . okay . i move amendment 1 in the name of the deputy minister . the question is that amendment 1 be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] okay , we have an objection , so we 'll take a vote by show of hands . all those in favour of amendment 1 . all those against . so , there voted four in favour , two against , and amendment 1 is agreed . we 'll move on now then to group 2 , which relates to the duty to report on the effect of the legislation . the lead amendment in the group is amendment 2 , in the name of the deputy minister . i move amendment 2 in the deputy minister 's name , and call on the deputy minister to speak to her amendments , and the other amendments in this group . julie morgan am : thank you , chair . the amendments in this group are to do with the post-implementation review of the bill , and i believe there was also a committee recommendation to this end from your committee , so you strongly influenced this amendment . it 's clear from members ' contributions to this group and recommendations by the committee at stage 1 that they share my commitment to the importance of post-implementation review of the effect of the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment . i 've already provided assurance that i agree with the importance placed on such a review , both in the explanatory memorandum and during stage 1 scrutiny . i also made a commitment to bring forward a government amendment to put a duty to undertake a post-implementation review on the face of the bill . i have done this with amendment 2 . amendment 5 sets out that this provision will come into force the day after royal assent . as i said in my responses to the stage 1 committee report , and as set out in the explanatory memorandum , the post-implementation review of this bill will not be a single piece of work , but a continuous programme of work during the years following the commencement of section 1 . firstly , we will continue to conduct attitudinal surveys , which will be used to track changes in attitude towards the physical punishment of children and prevalence of parents reporting that they use physical punishment . the surveys will also be used to monitor the effectiveness of our awareness-raising campaign . secondly , through a dedicated task and finish group , we are working with organisations to put in place arrangements to establish robust methods for capturing meaningful data relating to the bill and to consider the possible impact on services . turning to amendment 2c , this amendment would require welsh ministers to prepare and lay before the assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 is commenced . this amendment is unnecessary and is in conflict with what i think is a priority for the implementation of this bill : that is , given certainty on the commencement date and in enabling us to work towards this with our partners and stakeholders . i also think this amendment is not required because , as i 've already stated , we are preparing to assess the effectiveness of our awareness raising . in june , i shared the findings of a representative survey , which establishes a baseline on public awareness and opinion towards physical punishment of children and the proposed legislation . i shared this with the committee . lynne neagle am : thank you , deputy minister . i open it up for discussion now , then . janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : thank you , chair . i speak to amendments 2c , excluding 2d , to 2k , which relate to the deputy minister 's amendment 2 on preparing a published report on the effect of abolishing the defence of reasonable punishment . again , i must stress the importance of getting this right due to the controversial and long-lasting effects of removing the defence of reasonable punishment . amendments 2e to 2k outline what we would expect to be within this report , and we would wish to see a commitment from the deputy minister to ensure the national assembly for wales is fully apprised and able to scrutinise the result of this report . amendment 2c requests that the welsh government prepare a report on the awareness-raising campaign and lays it before the assembly before section 1 commences . as i have outlined under my amendments in group 1 , the understanding of the public about the implications of the bill can not be sidelined . although the deputy minister has repeated her commitment to a public awareness campaign , we , as the national assembly for wales , must be able to scrutinise its effectiveness before section 1 begins . as i noted under amendments 1b to 1e , there are specific groups of people who need to be evaluated on their understanding of the bill 's effect . i 'm sure that the deputy minister will agree that the harder-to-reach groups are undoubtedly the most vulnerable to any negative impacts that the bill will have because of the greater potential of a lack of awareness . it is , therefore , important for the assembly to be able to determine whether the awareness-raising campaign has had a positive effect on these groups of people . as will also be elaborated under amendment 2d , it is extremely important that we , as the parliament of wales , are fully apprised of the awareness-raising campaign 's impact . before we implement what will be a criminal offence , it is vital that we ensure that those affected are not adversely impacted because of a poorly targeted awareness campaign . therefore , i would be grateful if the deputy minister would commit to an independent evaluation of the awareness campaign 's effects before section 1 commences . lynne neagle am : thank you , janet . suzy davies . suzy davies am : thank you , chair . deputy minister , first of all , can i just say thank you for your opening remarks about the possibility of perhaps doing some work around amendment 2b ? i 'll come to that a little bit later , if i may . i just want to begin by commenting briefly on what you said about why you 'll be rejecting amendment 2c here . i actually do n't think that this amendment should affect or jeopardise the commencement date in any way at all . it 's an operational requirement to get this work done before the commencement date that 's in the draft bill at the moment . so , failing to meet that would be as a result of operations not going well , rather than anything intrinsic in the bill , so i 'm not sure i can accept your argument on that . and , on 2d\u2014very pleased to hear that you 'd be willing to introduce something about 'laying ' rather than 'publishing ' at stage 3 , but , in the spirit of recognising that this is the legislature , perhaps i could encourage you just to accept the amendment at this stage , because it does n't make any difference . your amendment is going to pass , and this amendment to it would be\u2014i think the gesture there would be very much appreciated . i 'll be speaking mainly to amendments 2a and 2b , but i want to begin , again , by thanking you for moving some way on this and considering amendments to the bill on the issue of reporting , because i know you were keen to avoid amendments in the name of simplicity ; you mentioned it earlier . but this is not a newid bychan , i 'm afraid , si\u00e2n ; the terms and the effect of this bill are quite extensive , and it does need the reassurances , if you like , necessary to mitigate potentially disproportionate effects of this bill on families where parents ' actions had been lawful up until this point in statute . it does need statutory underpinning . so , i am grateful to you for accepting this duty . i know that you 're sincere that you want this duty to report to show that the bill is effective in stopping smacking as a punishment , and also that it is not as harmful to parents as perhaps some of us fear . but , if this were me bringing forward this bill , i think i 'd want to show the world that i was doing the right thing a lot sooner than you appear to wish to do . amendment 2 means that the efficacy of the bill will not formally be assessed until seven years after it has passed . there are acts on the statute book that have lasted a lot less time than that . if you 're relying on the two-year period before section 1 comes into operation to do much of the heavy lifting on the culture change , and i think that is what you 're expecting\u2014you know , showing a reduction in the incidence of physical punishment , reducing the number of , and indeed the likelihood of , parents putting themselves in the path of criminal liability once those two years are up\u2014i really would have thought you 'd want people to know sooner , or as soon as the first possible opportunity on that . waiting five years , i think , will diminish the ability of you to prove the efficacy of those initial two years , and this is why i 'm grateful to you for your offer , because there may be a way where we can overcome that . if the trend of culture change is continuing after year 3\u2014so , basically , in the first year after section 1 comes into effect\u2014that 's great , but there 's a possibility it 's going to reverse . again , i do n't think i 'd want to wait five years to find that out . for myself , i think one year would probably be enough , but i think three years is a reasonable compromise , as opposed to five years , for a reporting period . i think seven years is just way too long for a formal evaluation of a bill 's effectiveness . i ca n't see the reason for quite that length of time\u2014i know you 've talked about new zealand\u2014but neither can the constitutional and legislative affairs committee . i think that 's worth pointing out . when they took the step of recommending this duty to evaluate and report , they also took the step of suggesting a three-year reporting period being more in keeping with other post-legislative scrutiny . that 's something i think we perhaps need to bear in mind now , as we enter this period of the consolidation of law . five/seven years is really something of an outlier , and while that might have been appropriate , perhaps , in new zealand , i do n't think that fits in with our timetables generally here in wales , and , of course , there are other countries that have introduced this over a period of years , and i note that you have n't drawn on them in order to support your argument . so , can i urge members and the minister to consider the arguments behind these amendments ? i do n't think it 's going to reassure anyone\u2014you may want to intervene at this point , hefin\u2014that we not only wo n't hear in this assembly , we wo n't hear in the next assembly , about the formal evaluation of this , unless i follow\u2014 hefin david am : i wo n't intervene ; i 'll speak . suzy davies am : is that okay ? hefin david am : yes , i 'll make the point . lynne neagle am : okay , i 've got\u2014 suzy davies am : yes , i 'll take the intervention . lynne neagle am : no , he does n't want to make an intervention\u2014 hefin david am : i wo n't do an intervention ; i 'll speak . lynne neagle am : \u2014he 'll make a contribution . suzy davies am : oh , apologies\u2014 hefin david am : just to say\u2014 suzy davies am : i 'll wait . hefin david am : well , let me put the intervention\u2014 . i 'll do it as an intervention , then . i just feel that\u2014i take your point , and i was expecting it . the point i was making about 1d and 1e is they close down choices to ministers in future assemblies . an evaluative practice would actually open up those choices and give future parliaments more options with regard to this bill , so i think it 's entirely consistent . i do n't think the minister , in putting in amendment 2 , was trying to undermine my argument . actually , i think she 's being constructive by doing that , and i think amendment 2 is a practical amendment that 's quite helpful , and its consequence will be to open up choices to future parliaments , whereas my objection to 1d and 1e is they close those down . suzy davies am : okay , well , as i say , i think , actually , the deputy minister 's offer of a three-year interim period might be part of a resolution to this . because i 'm not 100 per cent sure i accept your argument , either , because it closes it down for the interim period if we do n't move on with the deputy minister 's suggestion\u2014which i 'll talk about now , actually . because i am tempted to accept your offer . it absolutely makes sense and it 's clearly made with the best good faith here . but i need some clarity on what you would allow this assembly to do in helping define the terms of that interim report . because you 've been very clear that you do n't want to accept the things that janet finch-saunders has been talking about in a final report , and yet i can tell you we want to hear about these things . so , if you 're in a position where you can give a commitment at stage 3 not only to introduce an interim report , but that you will consult with , perhaps , this committee\u2014i 'll leave it to you\u2014on the contents of that interim report , what we would want to see tested , then i 'll be minded not to move amendment 2b . if you ca n't give me that reassurance , then i 'm going to move it anyway and we 'll return to it at stage 3 , if you do n't mind . just a final point on this issue of reporting within three months rather than as soon as practicable , and i do take your point that there may be a misalignment with reporting periods from the organisations you hope to talk to . again , at stage 3 , i 'm happy if you want to make three months six months , or something like that , but 'as soon as practicable ' is open ended , and what you think is practicable may be very different from what i or my constituents think is practicable . so , i do n't want to stick with what is practicable ; i would like you to put a date on this . if it 's a case that you think six months is long enough for data gathering and reporting from third parties , i think that 's fairly reasonable as well , but i 'm not minded to allow you to just keep this open ended . thank you . lynne neagle am : thank you , suzy . si\u00e2n . sian gwenllian am : yes , i welcome adding to the bill through amendment 2 , and what you 've said today also , that you 're willing to provide an interim report and bring an amendment forward to allow that through the bill , and to lay a report before the assembly . i am interested in what suzy is saying , and have a lot of sympathy with trying to tie it down to specific time periods , and not say 'when it will be practicable ' . therefore , i would encourage you not to move your amendments if you have the confirmation that you want to hear this morning from the minister regarding these issues . suzy davies am : i would like to . thanks . lynne neagle am : thank you . any other members ? no . deputy minister . julie morgan am : well , just to start off on that point , i think your suggestion about how we consult and discuss , i think i 'm very happy to accept that . so , i 'm happy to discuss that with you , and with the committee , before the third stage . so , i hope you will consider removing\u2014 . suzy davies am : no , genuinely i am . julie morgan am : right , thank you . well , just to go on to cover some of the points that have been raised , on the issue of training now , i think janet raised a number of points about training , and we do have an operations , procedures , processes and training task and finish group as part of our implementation work , and they are considering guidance and training requirements . there are many professional bodies represented on that group , many of whom i think have given evidence here today , and they 've really got a chance to have their say . the officials are also looking at training as part of the revision of the explanatory memorandum at stage 3 , so there will be more information about training there . but we have this group looking at it , and it is very key . generally , i think that all the contributions are very helpful , and i know they 're meant in the spirit of trying to improve the legislation . i ca n't support amendments 2a , 2c , and amendments 2e to 2k , because these amendments make little difference in terms of practical effect to what we have in the bill already , or they 're covered by the government amendments that i 've moved . but i do hope the committee is reassured that we are committed to undertaking a very thorough , multifaceted review of the impact of the legislation that includes tracking public attitudes and considering impacts on public services . now , tracking the public attitudes will be going along at regular points , so there 's no question there of having to wait ; we 'll be having regular reporting of public attitudes . suzy davies am : would you take an intervention there , deputy minister ? thank you very much . of course , i appreciate that you will not be supporting these amendments , but can you give us some indication of how many of the areas of interest to us you will be reporting on ? so , even if this is not a statutory commitment , what exactly from our list , our wish list here , would you be prepared to include in your evaluation ? julie morgan am : well , i would actually have thought all of them . all the areas you 've raised are very relevant , i think . obviously , this is not a statutory thing i 'm saying , but\u2014 suzy davies am : no , no , and this is not a\u2014 julie morgan am : yes , but considering those points you 've put forward , i think all of them have got a great deal of relevance . we will certainly be reporting to the group to consider any of the ideas that you 've suggested and , in particular with the data collection and the monitoring task and finish group , which is about developing methods to collect data , we will be putting forward some of the suggestions that you 've made on those issues . so , i do n't see any problem with that at all . suzy davies am : thank you . julie morgan am : so , as i say , i ca n't support the amendments . i 'm hopeful you may withdraw the two amendments\u2014i think one of yours and it was one of janet 's , was n't it\u2014so that we could work together on those before the next stage . because i am sympathetic to your views on these matters , and i think they do reflect some of the discussions in the committee as well . so , i 'd be happy to work with you to bring forward the amendments at stage 3 . in line with the recommendations of the finance committee , further details of the costs associated with the post-implementation review will be provided in a revised regulatory impact assessment at stage 3 . so , i think at this point i would ask that members reject the non-government amendments and agree to my amendments 2 and 5 , which will ultimately achieve the same policy aim without the need for unnecessary detail on the bill , with the exception , obviously , of those two amendments , which i 'm prepared to look at a way of moving forward on . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you , deputy minister . before disposing of amendment 2 , we will deal with the amendments to that amendment . janet , do you wish to move amendment 2c ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 2c be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] we have an objection , so i 'll take a vote by show of hands . all those in favour of amendment 2c , please show . all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against . amendment 2c is lost . suzy , do you wish to move amendment 2a ? suzy davies am : i move amendment 2a , yes . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 2a be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] okay , we 'll take a vote . all those in favour of amendment 2a , please show . all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against . amendment 2a is not agreed . janet , do you wish to move amendment 2d ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : janet , do you wish to move amendment 2e ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 2e be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] okay , we 'll take a vote . all those in favour of amendment 2e , please show . all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against . amendment 2e is not agreed . janet , do you wish to move amendment 2f ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 2f be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] we have an objection , so can i see all those in favour of amendment 2f ? all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against , and amendment 2f is not agreed . janet , do you wish to move amendment 2g ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 2g be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] okay , can i see all those in favour of amendment 2g ? all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against , and amendment 2g is not agreed . janet , do you wish to move amendment 2h ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 2h be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] we have an objection , so can i see all those in favour of amendment 2h ? all those against ? so , there voted two in favour , four against . amendment 2h is not agreed . janet , do you wish to move amendment 2i ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 2i be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] okay . can i see all those in favour of amendment 2i ? all those against . so , there voted two in favour , four against . amendment 2i is not agreed . janet , do you wish to move amendment 2j ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 2j be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] we have an objection , so i 'll take a vote . can i see all those in favour of 2j ? all those against ? so , there voted two in favour , four against . amendment 2j is not agreed . janet , do you wish to move amendment 2k ? janet finch-saunders am : i move . lynne neagle am : the question is that amendment 2k be agreed . does any member object ? [ objection . ] i 'll therefore take a vote by show of hands . all those in favour of amendment 2k ? all those against ? so , there voted two in favour , four against . amendment 2k is not agreed . suzy , do you wish to move amendment 2b ? suzy davies am : in view of the deputy minister 's reassurances , i wo n't move this amendment today , but obviously i reserve the right to bring something back if we ca n't reach consensus . thank you . lynne neagle am : does any other member wish to move amendment 2b ? okay , no . thank you . we 'll move on , then . if amendment 2 is not agreed , amendment 5 will fall . deputy minister , do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 2 ? thank you . the question is that amendment 2 be agreed . does any member object ? amendment 2\u2014 suzy davies am : objection ."
