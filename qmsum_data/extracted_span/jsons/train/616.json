    "answer": "user interface : uh . we maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . you just tell the television i want which channel . project manager : you wo n't user interface : or or you can say for example , um i want uh to list all the programme tonight . y you know , instead of uh remote control it 's doing the some searching for you , so you do n't have to look for the channel you want . just say maybe i just want to press i wan na have a button for all the movies tonight . or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight . and then you list a few , and i will choose from the list . so instead of pressing the channel number , i am choosing the programmes directly . yeah , that 's one way of uh making it useful . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . project manager : i i think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface : no , because no , project manager : s user interface : it 's not very a lot . th this information exists . for example you can get um project manager : like s uh you you you say we can use speech . user interface : you can use uh well for example anything . the the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it 's more natural . yeah . industrial designer : i i think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh i dunno marketing : i 'm a okay . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : i mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager : in the hand . marketing : and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : if we are going to add a speech interface , i 'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface : yeah . yes , possible . marketing : if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that i think the tv itself could have it . user interface : yeah . but industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and i could talk to the tv television itself . project manager : except if if you are far from the tv . marketing : i need not have an user interface : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : i mean we have some or something , different technology but project manager : this is it 's user interface : yeah , yeah . but th the main idea i wanted to s i wanted to say is that um there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch tv channel , there 's a option you can choose , either tv channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer : on the content . marketing : mm-hmm , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , yeah it 's it 's a good idea it 's a good idea project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so it 's more powerful . yeah . industrial designer : but i i think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface : no . no , because you see now all the tv programmes are available on the webs . they they are they are they are available in x_m_l_ format or whatever the format . we do n't care . we just say that this are some content . we just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . some of the websites they already provide this service , industrial designer : yeah yeah ."
