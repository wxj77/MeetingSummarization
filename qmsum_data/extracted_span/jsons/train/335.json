    "answer": "grad c : and so we had a meeting on friday talking about how to avoid that , and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the the subject m to really have intentions and sort of to act upon those , and um there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job because it it 's getting more complicated . so if you know anyone interested in in what i 'm about to describe , tell that person to to write a mail to me or jerry soon , fast . um the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks `` go shopping `` um `` take in uh a batch of art `` um `` visit do some sightseeing `` blah - blah - blah - blah - blah , sort of analogous to what fey has started in in in compiling compiling here and already she has already gone to the trouble of of anchoring it with specific um o { comment } um entities and real world places you will find in heidelberg . and um . so out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple , such as if if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film , the person can then decide `` ok , i wan na do that at this place `` , sort of make up their own itinerary a and and tasks and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h high level category list with them , but uh the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with with symbols for the objects . and so , the person can maybe make a mental note that `` ah yeah i wanted to go shopping here `` and `` i wanted to maybe take a picture of that `` and `` maybe um eat here `` and then goes in and solves the task with the system , ie { comment } fey , and um and we 're gon na try out that any questions ? grad g : so um y you 'll have those say somewhere what their intention was so you still have the the nice thing about having data where you know what the actual intention was ? grad c : mm - hmm . yeah . grad g : but they will um there 's nothing that says you know `` these are the things you want to do `` so they 'll say `` well these are the things i want to do `` and right , so they 'll have a little bit more natural interaction ? grad c : hopefully . grad g : ok . mm - hmm . grad f : so they 'll be given this map , which means that they wo n't have to like ask the system for in for like high level information about where things are ? grad c : yeah it 's a schematic tourist map . so it 'll be uh i it 'll still require the that information and an right ? that 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things grad g : uh - huh . mm - hmm . grad c : and so th the q first question for the subject is , `` so these are things , you know , we thought a tourist can do . is there anything that interests you ? `` grad g : mm - hmm . grad c : and the person can say `` yeah , sure sh this is something i would do . i would go shopping `` . yeah ? and then we can sort of this s instructor can say `` well , uh then you you may want to find out how to get over here grad g : mm - hmm . grad c : because this is where the shopping district is `` . grad g : so the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session ? grad c : no . just sort of ok , what what what would you like to buy and then um ok there you wan na buy a whatever cuckoos clocks grad g : yeah . grad c : ok and the there is a store there . grad e : mm - hmm . grad c : so the task then for that person is t finding out how to get there , right ? grad g : mm - hmm ."
