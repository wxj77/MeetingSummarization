    "answer": "suzy davies am : okay . well , it 's the argument you 've made before . i think what i was trying to get to is : how are we going to prove that this piece of legislation has worked effectively ? it 's about the data capture , i guess . what are you going to do to make sure that you acquire evidence in the future to show that this has worked , or potentially not worked ? i 'd be surprised if that was the case , but\u2014 . because , of course , that has an implication then on the resources for the various people you 'll be asking to collect the data . julie morgan am : yes . i think that 's very important because we need to know what is the effect of the legislation we 'll be bringing in . so , we will be having ongoing evaluation , we will be bringing in an independent body to evaluate . we have got ongoing monitoring and we 've got ongoing monitoring surveys looking at what are the views of the public . so , yes\u2014 suzy davies am : it 'll be directly linked to the bill , then , rather than that broad culture change . julie morgan am : the monitoring , asking the views of the public , is generally about issues related to the bill . the views of parents about whether this legislation\u2014 suzy davies am : sorry , i do n't want to labour this point . julie morgan am : and awareness . how aware they are . suzy davies am : basically , we need a question , 'has this bill stopped you smacking your child ? ' that 's the core question . so , phrase it differently , yes ? julie morgan am : yes . well , we are in the surveys asking how many people feel that they do smack their child , but this is any physical punishment , actually , not just smacking\u2014 suzy davies am : and it 's for the future , not for now . julie morgan am : \u2014and how many , actually , are doing that . and it is consistently going down , as you said ."
