    "answer": "industrial designer : so um well i i figured uh we should um identify some user requirements , and from my experience , i wan na uh , and from research i did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you ca n't uh ca n't have like uh waffling on this point , you know . project manager : industrial designer : really have it needs to be able y y have to be able to find it . because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . so uh , i also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those , and , as i said in the first meeting , um and then uh we might wan na talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product project manager : industrial designer : so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth . i did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth , so , i guess this guy zenith uh created the flashmatic , which i kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the tv on and off , that might be interesting . and um so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels c so i think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later . project manager : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was uh sensitive to the sun , so that uh it would get would start off by the you 'd get it would easily cause um problems . so , uh i in addition to uh looking at the um uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today which i think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind . marketing : fantastic . user interface : industrial designer : it 'd be easy to find . and um it would uh y you 'd you could throw it at things if if the tv did n't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . and since i 'm not really um industrial designer , i did n't really know what to do with this slide . but um i just took some different uh schematics and i put them into this , and i guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . i do n't know why um we were asked to do this . so , uh personal preferences , um user interface : industrial designer : i think we could uh i i 'm really thinking outside the box here , and i think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference . user interface : industrial designer : so something that 's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it . i think um it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you did n't have to um uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user 's home . um i think uh it needs to be waterproof , because uh sometimes they fall into cups project manager : industrial designer : and , you know , it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that . um if you uh mi one of one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it 's done its job or not , because half the time , i keep pushing on the remote control , and i do n't know if it 's actually understood my message , so i think it should give you some sort of an oral cue . and uh , course i never wan na replace the battery . so , marketing :"
