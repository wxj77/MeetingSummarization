    "answer": "phd f : there 's , um in my mind , anyways , there 's a difference between , um , acoustic features and acoustic events . and i think of acoustic features as being , um , things that linguists talk about , like , um professor e : so , stuff that 's not based on data . phd f : stuff that 's not based on data , necessarily . professor e : yeah . oh , ok . yeah . yeah , ok . phd f : right . that 's not based on , you know , acoustic data . so they talk about features for phones , like , uh , its height , grad a : yeah . phd f : its tenseness , laxness , things like that , grad a : mm - hmm . phd f : which may or may not be all that easy to measure in the acoustic signal . versus an acoustic event , which is just some something in the acoustic signal that is fairly easy to measure . um . so it 's , um it 's a little different , in at least in my mind . professor e : i mean , when we did the spam work i mean , there we had we had this notion of an , uh , auditory @ @ { comment } auditory event . grad a : good . that 's great . professor e : and , uh , um , called them `` avents `` , uh , uh , uh , with an a at the front . phd f : mm - hmm . professor e : uh . and the the the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere . so . grad a : mm - hmm . professor e : um . a sudden change or a relatively rapid change in some spectral characteristic will will do sort of this . i mean , there 's certainly a bunch of a bunch of places where you know that neurons are gon na fire because something novel has happened . that was that was the main thing that we were focusing on there . but there 's certainly other things beyond what we talked about there that are n't just sort of rapid changes , but phd f : it 's kinda like the difference between top - down and bottom - up . professor e : yeah . phd f : i think of the acoustic you know , phonetic features as being top - down . you know , you look at the phone and you say this phone is supposed to be you know , have this feature , this feature , and this feature . whether tha those features show up in the acoustic signal is sort of irrelevant . whereas , an acoustic event goes the other way . here 's the signal . here 's some event ."
