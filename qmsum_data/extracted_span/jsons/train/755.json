    "answer": "darren millar am : can i just ask , in terms of the impact of brexit , have you done any assessment of what you think might happen , or have any of the institutions made available to you any assessments of what they think is likely to happen to their individual institutions , going forward ? you 've mentioned scenarios earlier on , david , so what scenarios have you set out ? dr david blaney : there 's a welsh government he brexit working group , which is chaired by one of the government directors , and we sit on that . and we have provided that group with early summaries of the risks and the potential impact , in terms of the exposure of the sector to eu-sourced funding . we have , as part of that working group , explored those issues that it would be really very helpful for either the welsh government to try to put in place or for the welsh government to persuade uk government to do . and i think , in our submission , we identified a number of areas of what we would consider to be a helpful action , and that has been worked through that working group . we know that it has informed welsh government 's position , in terms of what it does and also in terms of the conversations that they have with her majesty 's government . beyond that , what we have n't done in that working group is share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would respond to different scenarios . we are not able to do that here either because , inevitably , they would have varying degrees of unpalatability and they would have to be managed very , very carefully . you take cost out , which is essentially the response , you actually take people's jobs out , and all of that has to be managed carefully . so , that 's not really a matter for public consideration , but we do know that the institutions are looking at a range of scenarios on what they would do . bethan mentioned earlier on that the current deficit for the sector is a managed deficit\u2014it 's not something that has taken them by surprise . they are responding to what they see as the dip between where diamond was reporting and where the money starts flowing . similarly , i think we 're comfortable that there is a managed approach to the scenarios that they 're testing within institutions . so , they will do what they need to do to sustain themselves . the bigger issue really , in a public policy context , is the potential damage for the sector to be able to deliver for wales in terms of research and skills development and all the other contributions . darren millar am : so , you 're confident that they 're taking a robust approach to planning for various scenarios , going forward , are you , as individual heis ? dr david blaney : yes , and as the deal becomes more clear politically , then they will obviously have greater clarity in terms of which of these scenarios they need to work up more fully , but they are sighted on it . darren millar am : okay . can i just ask about fee and access plans , and how brexit might impact them ? to what extent do you think that they could be impacted ? dr david blaney : i think there are two dimensions to maybe touch upon there . fee and access plans are approved annually by us . they are approved in advance of the recruitment cycle for the year that they apply to . so , we 're just in the process now of finalising our consideration of fee and access plans for the 2019-20 academic year . so , there 's quite a long lead time . we , as part of that process , go through similar\u2014we look at their financial sustainability , which is based on their forecasts\u2014data to the stuff we 've just been discussing . and also , of course , the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types , from different domains , are going to be recruited . so , clearly , if there is a continuing downward pressure on eu student recruitment , then that will reduce the amount of fee income that 's going to come in , unless they can find other students , and that will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans . in terms of process , we have two things that we can do . if institutions are becoming aware that the basis upon which they 've submitted a fee plan is fundamentally different from the reality , then they can come into us for a change to their fee plan . so , we have a change process . if it 's not fundamentally different , but there are always differences between what you plan and what happens three years later\u2014 . we also monitor after the event and , if there are differences , we would then obviously require institutions to explain those differences . if they 've had fewer students and less investment , we would need to understand that . conversely , if they 'd had more students , and potentially more investment , we 'd want to know what they 'd spent it on , and if they 've done different things , we 'd want to understand that as well . so , we do challenge through a monitoring process . the only other thing that 's perhaps worth saying is that , in the 2019-20 fee and access plans\u2014they 're not published yet , so i ca n't give you the full detail\u2014five universities have made reference to brexit and the brexit impact , and things they want to do through their fee and access plan to try and address some of those issues , so they 're in there as well . darren millar am : but we 've already said , have n't we , that it may be nothing to do with brexit , this dip in eu recruitment , because there are other factors like the attractiveness of the estates and the environment that young people might be educated in ? but they 're making assumptions that it 's linked to brexit , are they ? dr david blaney : not really . i think they 're making assumptions that it could be . there are things they want to do to enhance and to protect student mobility , and some of that will be funded through fee plan investment . so , the brexit conversation between the eu and the uk government might or might not sustain erasmus engagement , and if it does n't , then they need to find other ways of trying to support that sort of thing . so , that 's what we 're beginning to see in the fee plans . it 's them thinking about how else we can do this stuff ."
