    "query": "<s> how did the group discussed about the possible environmental-friendly material ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : um , so that would work . um , oop . go back there . um , another thing i think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . um , from previous researches i 've carried out on other projects , um we 've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : so they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . so , for example , a screw that 's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . so um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . so , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and i think that would be very important for products now . especially 'cause there 's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious . project manager : right , um , one question . this , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ? industrial designer : um and then yeah . yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . and that 's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . i mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it 's the product 's responsibility to get rid of what they 've made . um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gon na wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . something like the case , if it 's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . project manager : mm-hmm . would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? or would we contribute to another group ? industrial designer : you could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . for a certain percentage at least . project manager : alright . industrial designer : not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , project manager : okay . this sounds like a really great idea . industrial designer : but project manager : one thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : um , so we 'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . you would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive . industrial designer : well i the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they do n't need to be manually de um deconstructed . like , you do n't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . because of this , their properties are smart material . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : all you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves . project manager : alright . we 'll still have to investigate the financial implications . industrial designer : so i suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but project manager : alright . i like the environmental approach . um , we 'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well . industrial designer : yeah . okay . um also there is um components . this 'll be how it uh will actually work . but i have n't put this plan together yet . project manager : i 'm sorry , could you industrial designer : there we go project manager : those were um industrial designer : . sorry , should i go back . this would actually show the circuit diagram . although i have n't come up with the final circuit yet . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so i just put all those components in . project manager : so those are what , um , we 'll c construct the remote . those are all the industrial designer : yeah . i it just shows what sort of energy source . it could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . um , an ' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . project manager : alright . great ."
