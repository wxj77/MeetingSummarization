    "answer": "project manager : um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you , however , um there are some changes that i 've got from on high user interface : okay . project manager : that um are a bit uh well w what i did n't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television . user interface : okay . project manager : so the all in one idea goes out the window . and they require that the uh user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : actually i 'll get to that at the end point number four , um we 'll get what you 've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . so um , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ? marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : raring to go ? okay . good stuff . mm . marketing : um . so how project manager : oh i need to plug you in . industrial designer : marketing : s project manager : just about . user interface : wow . industrial designer : it 's a inspired design . user interface : marketing : sh do you want me to hold it ? project manager : uh there we go , just screw 'em on in . gon na have to swap them round so marketing : so , after that ? project manager : now , it was function f_ eight . marketing : f_ eight . f oh sorry f_ eight . project manager : that 's the wee blue one . blue one f_ eight . marketing : okay . project manager : should do it , good one . marketing : yeah . yeah . uh , me again , rajan the marketing expert . uh , as we have decided in the last meeting that i have to find out , sorry , yeah sure . project manager : hold on , sorry . and if you just click that it 'll go ahead , one at a time . marketing : yeah , yeah . uh actually , sorry i have to see the other , sorry . project manager : sorry , uh . marketing : yeah , thank you . project manager : marketing : uh , yes , i have to look at the uh market potential for this product , uh , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? then project manager : p press f_ five to start it first . marketing : sorry . okay . yeah , i can , okay . project manager : jesus . marketing : uh then uh the methodology i adopted to find out all this was market survey . a a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . and what we got was , we found that if you uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . they are not so good looking . so , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . and yes that 's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . so even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . project manager : excellent . marketing : then and the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because i think i believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . so this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . so we have to take care of this fact also . then . uh it was function i want to go to . project manager : oh you wan na go back ? just escape . marketing : uh , escape , okay thank you . then if we look at this slide , project manager : okay . marketing : uh these are in your shared documents , you can see , project manager : okay . marketing : like uh , sorry . user interface : so , sorry i was just gon na say , what was the question for this ? or is are you coming on to that ? marketing : ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . user interface : okay . so these percentages are are what ? marketing : yeah , these are different age group persons like uh sorry , i can open it in another way . project manager : okay . speech recognition . marketing : uh , yes . if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . industrial designer : marketing : so we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , and i uh and i think that most of the users of the rem uh tv are belong to this age group . so we should look project manager : hmm . we 're als we we 're looking at who buys it as well . marketing : yeah . we can look at that that factor also , so yes . project manager : uh , which i think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm , mm . marketing : so , and and then project manager : fifteen to twe marketing : yes . i think so . uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . project manager : marketing : they find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . so it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn . they need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . so um this is all about project manager : okay . marketing : uh market potential by me . project manager : user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : uh , yes , th thank you . project manager : okay , thank you . um , follow on with helen ? yeah please . user interface : yep , sure , that 's cool , um marketing : yeah we have to take that out . project manager : oh , so we do yeah . marketing : sorry . user interface : yeah . marketing : project manager : fun and games . marketing : sorry . project manager : do n't know if the cable 's gon na be long enough . marketing : uh sorry , i have . project manager : i think i just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well . marketing : brian , this one also i . yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : thank you very much brian . user interface : i can turn my computer quickly if that 's okay . marketing : if you want me to help , yeah . user interface : um , yep . project manager : marketing : yeah . user interface : okay , and then what do i press , f_ eight ? marketing : uh f_ eight . function f_ eight . project manager : function f_ eight . user interface : oh right . marketing : mm s . user interface : okay , cool . marketing : it 's not coming . function f_ eight , okay . yeah . user interface : yeah . no signal . marketing : computer . computer adjusting , yeah . project manager : there you go . user interface : okay . cool . marketing : yeah . user interface : okay and then how do i press the the big one , to get it on to the big project manager : uh f_ five . user interface : f_ five and i press that again to get it off as well do i ? marketing : escape . project manager : um , f_ five and escape 'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . user interface : okay , so um i 'm the interface design designer , user interface designer sorry , uh i 'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um i 'm i 'm also i want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , project manager : user interface : so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it 's a big concern of ours . okay , and how do i press n just the next button ? project manager : uh just a left uh user interface : the arrow ? okay . project manager : left mouse button . user interface : so um i looked at existing designs and also um the information that raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . um and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our tv i think . project manager : mm-hmm . okay . user interface : so um what they like and what they find fashionable . project manager : 'kay . user interface : and ergonomics , we said um , i do n't know i have n't actually been able to do any of this myself , project manager : industrial designer : user interface : but um maybe that comes up , i do n't know . project manager : that can come under arlo as well . user interface : and the findings , well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . that 's what people want to do . um , so they need to be included , um , but i 've got some pictures here of some leading ones . i do n't know how to get to them , project manager : uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar . user interface : do i press f_ five is it ? escape ? oh okay , cool . i have n't got my glasses on so i hope it 's this one . project manager : uh okay . user interface : these are two leading um remote controls at the moment . project manager : 'kay . user interface : you know they 're grey , they 've i mean this one 's got loads of buttons , it 's hard to tell from here what they actually do , project manager : user interface : and they do n't look very exciting at all . um , personally i prefer this one just because it 's looks easier use , it 's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : um , but there you go , that 's what we 're up against , project manager : user interface : and i think we can do much better than that . project manager : we hope so . industrial designer : of course . user interface : um hang on . f_ five , project manager : user interface : okay , sorry . personal preferences . um , well i think we need to l i think the ergonomics is quite um important , um project manager : yeah , particularly if we 've uh there was a bit in raj 's about r_s_i_ and things as well . marketing : yeah . user interface : uh-huh . and um i thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand-held more um not as uh computery and project manager : organic . user interface : or organic , yeah , more organic shape i think . um simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so i think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . project manager : sales , . okay . user interface : um , hand-held and portable i think is portamint is important because t_f_t_ have just um released um i think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so um project manager : yeah it 's like a , yeah . it 's . user interface : yeah , no seven inches is n't that big but um anyway um so hand-held and portable and uh m i thought about other functions for tv but as you pointed out people do n't actually want that , project manager : right . marketing : yeah . project manager : and also the company want to keep it stuck to the tv for uh to keep down the production time . user interface : so maybe we forget about that . it 's for one tv oh right okay , sure . and so the last thing i thought w which i quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : exactly . yeah . user interface : um which does already e exist but it 's not very widely used i do n't think . project manager : yeah . user interface : easy finder with the a whistle function or something , project manager : okay . user interface : or rechargeable station because it 's a pain when you run out of batteries . project manager : yeah . user interface : and i think that , yep , that 's it . project manager : that 's cool . industrial designer : so uh , i noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , user interface : okay ? mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh i was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? um , or if project manager : user interface : industrial designer : is that a function we want in the remote ? project manager : um , do you have trouble whistling ? user interface : um , i have n't been able to industrial designer : i do n't , but i i know a lot of people do right . project manager : really ? industrial designer : yeah it just project manager : ooh . industrial designer : i mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ? project manager : yeah , i suppose that 's true . user interface : mm-hmm , yeah project manager : well i suppo uh you could y you could have the user interface : or some sort of voice project manager : you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it 's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? . industrial designer : that 's costly though . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : uh and then , what would the response be ? it beeps back at you or something ? project manager : sounds good . user interface : yeah , something . industrial designer : okay . user interface : industrial designer : well , uh let me set this up . so i plug it in , press f_ five ? function f_ five ? project manager : function f_ eight for the um the uh industrial designer : or function f_ eight ? okay . user interface : oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . industrial designer : okay . i think it 's uh just to lock it in . it 's got it . project manager : yeah . user interface : okay . industrial designer : okay . project manager : industrial designer : um . so as the industrial designer my job is to take an input from you guys , user interface : industrial designer : um so it 's good you went first , project manager : alright . industrial designer : and i jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . user interface : project manager : let 's remember that . industrial designer : um so raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and um he also mentioned that uh the current products do n't always match users ' operating behaviour . um , a lot of the buttons are n't used , and uh he mentioned that they 're not fun to use . and uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it 'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it 'll beep back and say you know oh here i am or something of this sort . project manager : mm-hmm . but sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you 're likely to get it beeping back at you . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : oh yeah , yeah , that 's true . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : well maybe you could have a um hmm tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . um . project manager : sorry i did n't mean to derail you there . industrial designer : yeah well tha that 's uh for later down the road um , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , um and not computery , user interface : industrial designer : right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . project manager : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so i took these all into consideration and also i have some limitations from the boss . project manager : industrial designer : right um , and practical limitations which i kinda threw out the window . project manager : industrial designer : and so i did a little research and unfortunately all i had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we 've made before , user interface : industrial designer : which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains or uh or a high speed train . project manager : ah is that what that is ? user interface : industrial designer : right and having personally worked with all these products uh i have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these . user interface : project manager : well that 's cool . if you if you can build space craft you 'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah . industrial designer : right . so , user interface : yeah sure . industrial designer : i figured , just put 'em all together . project manager : industrial designer : you got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your tv , and um user interface : project manager : industrial designer : as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . give it one button user interface : industrial designer : and and it 's a you know , for the the cowboy in all of us marketing : project manager : industrial designer : i i 'm not quite sure what the the function is there but project manager : right okay . user interface : well i like that design . industrial designer : yeah it 's a g i mean you could have a you know a project manager : is that just switches on the speech recognition and it 's entirely speech operated , is it ? industrial designer : right . so i think i i missed the budget thing , project manager : yeah . user interface : industrial designer : it was fifty million euros ? user interface : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and we got ta sell twenty five of them ? right . okay . user interface : yeah , not a problem . marketing : fifty million was uh prof project manager : ah now it 's fif fifty million euros we 've got ta uh we 've g marketing : as a profit . user interface : industrial designer : oh okay , so i i mixed those numbers . project manager : got ta make profit , so we 're making that at twelve and a half euros a time . user interface : industrial designer : okay . well i guess more realistically then , we need a product that 's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic uh , you know , um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : an energy source which 'd probably just be uh your regular batteries project manager : okay . industrial designer : um , we do n't wan na have it project manager : would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? is that is that gon na mark up a lot ? user interface : or a little base station or something , . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , we could do that too . um , i had n't thought of that . yeah . user interface : that might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we do n't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it 's more , it 's that 's cheaper to just provide batteries . project manager : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : right . project manager : i mean if you think about these base stations now it 's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , user interface : a battery in it , kinda . project manager : so i do n't think it 'd up up the price that much . industrial designer : right , so so user interface : okay . industrial designer : the unirs the user interface user interface : okay . industrial designer : uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we 're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power project manager : okay . industrial designer : behind our product . user interface : industrial designer : um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you do n't have to worry about . project manager : okay . industrial designer : um so here 's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know it 's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . and i suppose you all know how it works because we 've all used it and we would n't be in a company designing remote controls if we did n't know what they were so uh personal preferences , i think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , uh non volatile memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it 's not blasting . user interface : mm . mm that 's a good idea actually i like the programmable options . marketing : yeah , me too . industrial designer : oh okay . and the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort project manager : user interface : industrial designer : and it 's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . project manager : right . user interface : mm 'kay . industrial designer : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : that 's all i got . project manager : 'kay , thank you very much , um i 'll take that back . industrial designer : project manager : industrial designer : ooh that 's tight . project manager : right , also so um a notice i got not very long before the meeting , so did n't manage to forward it on to you , it is let 's see , i 'll find it myself , um ta industrial designer : okay , i do n't think we need to screw it in . project manager : nah . industrial designer : just push it . marketing : yeah . project manager : we had that um to dis-include teletext um because it 's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . um , dunno what oracle would have to say with that but never mind . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : um it 's only for the television , which i 'm presuming means it 's for a specific television , user interface : okay . project manager : and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . user interface : corporate colour . project manager : yellow . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yellow . project manager : i presume . um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything 's yellow . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : and the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh i do n't know exactly how sort of incorpor i mean , i guess if you 're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . user interface : yeah . project manager : uh , where am i ? user interface : okay . project manager : okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we 're going to actually have . user interface : 'kay . project manager : uh , now , we had as listed options we had industrial designer : project manager : speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , lcd interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons so we 'll pretty much take that one as read . user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : we 'll use the the basic functions for a television . no teletext . um okay hold on . user interface : although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . project manager : not enough buttons you mean ? user interface : yeah . project manager : so sorta strike a balance between a a few and a user interface : well project manager : or it looks like we 're just cutting on the um user interface : mm . on the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff . project manager : i do however have this from over my head , that they do n't want teletext on it . user interface : mm-hmm , okay . okay , cool . project manager : uh maybe raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they 'll send marketing : about cost . project manager : some information about that , about um what people , whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . marketing : okay . project manager : okay um . so uh i take it your position arlo is that the bells and whistles we 've got ta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . industrial designer : yeah yeah . project manager : um so i mean a a the sort of inkling i 'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that i 'm getting sent is that they 're quite interested in a t_f_t_ display , interactive display . however that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry raj um said people did n't like . although i guess if there 's a sort of user interface : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . project manager : if you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of windows-style drop down menus or whatever , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : i think maybe that 's a bit , going a bit far user interface : yeah . project manager : but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple . user interface : yeah . okay . project manager : um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? user interface : um glow in the dark material i was thinking . project manager : okay . so marketing : i user interface : um , so i i guess that would be cheaper than a light i think . marketing : uh may i say something about ? project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : uh actually i think it 's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . but user interface : often lost s was that , marketing : yeah are lost project manager : lost , yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . but if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . marketing : like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , project manager : that 's cool . user interface : mm-hmm , marketing : and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales , project manager : that 's cool . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so we should take it into consideration also . project manager : okay , cool . industrial designer : well hmm . project manager : um speech recognition i take it user interface : industrial designer : oh it 's project manager : i do n't , i 've i know of no products um that use speech recognition well . industrial designer : they 're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . you could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh b_b_c_ one and it goes to that channel . project manager : really ? industrial designer : yeah , it did n't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . they mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to b_b_c_ one . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for b_b_c_ two on b_b_c_ one 'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . industrial designer : right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you 'd be watching the tv and then all of a sudden it 'd it 'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , project manager : mm . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but if you can work around that that noise problem user interface : 'kay . project manager : uh-huh . user interface : well what about industrial designer : user interface : this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that 's built into the tv um that you can press and it 'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we ca n't hear or something project manager : ah , that 's a good idea . user interface : um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . industrial designer : right . project manager : so like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . user interface : if you find if y industrial designer : right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : what you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the tv speaker , or not a remo i 'm sorry , a microphone by the tv speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you ca n't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their tvs . user interface : mm . yeah , that 's the only thing , yeah . industrial designer : but yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the tv speaker project manager : that we should just stick on , yeah . industrial designer : which user interface : that comes with our remote control . industrial designer : right , and then the remote control would know um what 's being produced by the television . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : and that 's a sort of basic r_f_ kind of frequency so it 'll be cheap . industrial designer : right , right . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : right , right . um . yeah that 's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . if you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you do n't even need to find it . you just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the tv on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it 's within you know , within hearing range . and uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you 've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . project manager : uh-huh . user interface : that could also be built into the tv though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : well , hopefully we 're uh we 're ahead of the curve . project manager : it might do us out of a job . user interface : yeah , okay . project manager : um okay . i like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . um so i think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , so i th user interface : and the expense . project manager : yeah and expense and the time . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so i think if we 're going to go well i mean like the thing about the there 's the problem with the t_f_t_ or the lcd kind of thing is if you 're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . um , but i guess not i thin we 'll just we 'll just pretend that 's not a problem . um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? is that user interface : maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that 's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . project manager : contrast contra well . industrial designer : yeah , no th the material 's cheap but it 's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then uh if you 're , if you 're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it wo n't glow any more . project manager : yeah , okay . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so if it 's dow it 's d uh yeah . or if it 's down under the couch cushions industrial designer : right . project manager : um which is where i usually find mine . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : right . project manager : um okay , well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , user interface : yeah , project manager : um if we 're gon na have to user interface : 'cause what i thought , main project manager : if we 're gon na have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our um slogan . user interface : slogan , yeah . project manager : uh then you know they 're gon na be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . user interface : right . mm-hmm . 'cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you 're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : alright , so n sorta if if if we 're gon if we 're gon na go with the idea of um uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . user interface : that was more of a a gimmick . project manager : do you think ? uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then . user interface : yeah , unnecessary . yeah . project manager : okay . um , okay so scratch that . uh so we 've got do we want to go with the t_f_t_ idea or the is that far too expensive ? industrial designer : um yeah we 're getting a lot of features now , i i think project manager : well i mean i think i think the sort of find the finder things i mean it 's uh i could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um industrial designer : well , i think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around , there 's a good chance the the t_f_t_ screen would break or uh get damaged . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : they 're pretty fragile . project manager : okay . user interface : so is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a t_f_t_ screen ? project manager : um no , i mean that was going on ravs uh raj 's sort of um marketing research i guess . um uh so we 'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . um . so that 's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um industrial designer : yeah mm . project manager : uh you were finding out about teletext . marketing : yeah . project manager : if you could find out that uh marketing : totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi project manager : um i think we 're gon na scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a um expensive , user interface : yeah you think so ? industrial designer : oh no it 's it 's much cheaper than the t_f_t_ , it 's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . project manager : no ? oh right , okay . industrial designer : and it 'd it 'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , project manager : is it not the circuits that cost industrial designer : like a project manager : oh right , okay . uh well that kind of takes back the r_f_ the r_f_ remote sort of idea as well . user interface : okay . industrial designer : project manager : um . five minutes . okay . decisions . uh , votes , let 's vote . who wants t_f_t_ ? industrial designer : project manager : no-one does . marketing : project manager : excellent , so we 'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? industrial designer : okay . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm , that 's cool . project manager : um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . and what else was i thinking of that i have n't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability . marketing : glow in dark . project manager : uh user interface : if it 's not too expensive s i think it 's a good gimmick . project manager : uh o okay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : okay , so . um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they 're not already in there as well . so , it just helps me summarize them . industrial designer : yeah yeah . marketing : here ?

okay . project manager : i did . industrial designer : just making sure . project manager : user interface : okay . project manager : so user interface : what i thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , it 's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . um , a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic project manager : okay . user interface : and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : the rubber rather than project manager : more sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of . user interface : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . marketing : um but we have to take care like project manager : industrial designer : user interface : marketing : but we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it should n't be too harmful . so , whatever material we use it should be yeah . project manager : oh no , ethics , that 's gon na cost us money . user interface : marketing : so we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . project manager : okay , safety . user interface : oh i think wi with the more organic shape of it it wo n't be as it wo n't as have many sharp corners as that , so that 's something good , um project manager : yeah . user interface : i dunno , i mean industrial designer : we could go comp yeah . project manager : it sme smells good for children . user interface : industrial designer : we could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and it 's got the thing on the inside . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : and there 's no buttons at all , it 's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . marketing : project manager : that sounds , user interface : that 's a good idea . industrial designer : and then ch children will love it . project manager : yeah it 's gon na have to be it 's gon na be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry . user interface : interesting . industrial designer : oh yellow , yellow ball . right . user interface : yeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ?
