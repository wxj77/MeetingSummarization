    "answer": "grad c : ok . um , so , yeah , the this past week i 've been main mainly occupied with , um , getting some results , u from the sri system trained on this short hub - five training set for the mean subtraction method . and , um , i ran some tests last night . but , um , c the results are suspicious . um , it 's , um , cuz they 're the baseline results are worse than , um , andreas than results andreas got previously . and it could have something to do with , um phd f : that 's on digits ? grad c : that 's on digits . it c it it could h it could have something to do with , um , downsampling . that 's that 's worth looking into . um , d and , um , ap ap apart from that , i guess the the main thing i have t ta i have to talk is , um , where i 'm planning to go over the next week . um . so i 've been working on integrating this mean subtraction approach into the smartkom system . and there 's this question of , well , so , um , in my tests before with htk i found it worked it worked the best with about twelve seconds of data used to estimate the mean , but , we 'll often have less { comment } in the smartkom system . um . so i think we 'll use as much data as we have at a particular time , and we 'll we 'll concatenate utterances together , um , to get as much data as we possibly can from the user . but , um , there 's a question of how to set up the models . so um , we could train the models . if we think twelve seconds is ideal we could train the models using twelve seconds to calculate the mean , to mean subtract the training data . or we could , um , use some other amount . so like i did an experiment where i , um , was using six seconds in test , um , but , for i tried twelve seconds in train . and i tried , um , um , the same in train i 'm a i tried six seconds in train . and six seconds in train was about point three percent better . um , and um , it 's not clear to me yet whether that 's something significant . so i wan na do some tests and , um , actually make some plots of , um for a particular amount of data and test what happens if you vary the amount of data in train . phd f : mm - hmm . professor d : uh , guenter , i do n't know if you t followed this stuff but this is , uh , a uh , uh , long - term long - term window f f yeah . yeah , he you talked about it . professor g : yeah , we we spoke about it already , professor d : oh , ok . so you know what he 's doing . professor g : yeah . professor d : alright . grad c : y s so i was i actually ran the experiments mostly and i i was i was hoping to have the plots with me today . i just did n't get to it . but , um yeah , i wou i would be curious about people 's feedback on this cuz i 'm @ @ { comment } i p i think there are some i think it 's it 's kind of like a a bit of a tricky engineering problem . i 'm trying to figure out what 's the optimal way to set this up . so , um , i 'll try to make the plots and then put some postscript up on my on my web page . and i 'll mention it in my status report if people wan na take a look . professor d : you could clarify something for me . you 're saying point three percent , you take a point three percent hit , when the training and testing links are do n't match or something ? phd e : hello . professor d : is that what it is ? grad c : w well , it c professor d : or ? grad c : i i do n't think it it 's just for any mismatch you take a hit . professor d : yeah . grad c : i in some cases it might be u better to have a mismatch . like i think i saw something like like if you only have two seconds in test , or , um , maybe it was something like four seconds , you actually do a little better if you , um , train on six seconds than if you train on four seconds . professor d : yeah . right . grad c : um , but the case , uh with the point three percent hit was using six seconds in test , um , comparing train on twelve seconds { comment } versus train on six seconds . professor d : and which was worse ? grad c : the train on twelve seconds . professor d : ok . but point three percent , uh , w from what to what ? that 's point three percent grad c : on the the the accuracies w went from it was something vaguely like ninety - five point six accuracy , um , improved to ninety - five point nine wh when i professor d : so four point four to four point one . so yeah . so about a about an eight percent , uh , seven or eight percent relative ? uh , yeah . well , i think in a p you know , if if you were going for an evaluation system you 'd care . but if you were doing a live system that people were actually using nobody would notice . it 's uh , i think the thing is to get something that 's practical , that that you could really use . grad c : huh . that 's that 's interesting . alright , the e uh , i see your point . i guess i was thinking of it as , um , an interesting research problem . the how to g i was thinking that for the asru paper we could have a section saying , `` for smartkom , we we d in we tried this approach in , uh , interactive system `` , which i do n't think has been done before . professor d : yeah . mm - hmm . grad c : and and then there was two research questions from that . professor d : mm - hmm . grad c : and one is the k does it still work if you just use the past history ? professor d : mm - hmm . grad c : alright , and the other was this question of , um what i was just talking about now . so i guess that 's why i thought it was interesting . professor d : i mean , a short - time fft short - time cepstrum calculation , uh , mean u mean calculation work that people have in commercial systems , they do this all the time . they the they calculate it from previous utterances and then use it , you know . grad c : yeah , um . professor d : but but , uh , as you say , there has n't been that much with this long long - time , uh , spectra work . grad c : oh , o oh , ok . so that 's that 's that 's standard . um professor d : yeah . pretty common . yeah . um , but , u uh , yes . no , it is interesting . and the other thing is , i mean , there 's two sides to these really small , uh , gradations in performance . um , i mean , on the one hand in a practical system if something is , uh , four point four percent error , four point one percent error , people wo n't really tell be able to tell the difference . on the other hand , when you 're doing , uh , research , you may , eh you might find that the way that you build up a change from a ninety - five percent accurate system to a ninety - eight percent accurate system is through ten or twelve little things that you do that each are point three percent . so so the they they it 's i do n't mean to say that they 're they 're irrelevant . uh , they are relevant . but , um , i for a demo , you wo n't see it . grad c : mm - hmm . right . ok . professor d : yeah . grad c : and , um , let 's l let 's see . um , ok . and then there 's um , another thing i wan na start looking at , um , wi is , um , the choice of the analysis window length . so i 've just been using two seconds just because that 's what carlos did before . uh , i wrote to him asking about he chose the two seconds . and it seemed like he chose it a bit informally . so , um , with the with the htk set - up i should be able to do some experiments , on just varying that length , say between one and three seconds , in a few different reverberation conditions , um , say this room and also a few of the artificial impulse responses we have for reverberation , just , um , making some plots and seeing how they look . and , um , so , with the the sampling rate i was using , one second or two seconds or four seconds is at a power of two um , number of samples and , um , i 'll i 'll jus f for the ones in between i guess i 'll just zero - pad . professor d : mm - hmm . i guess one thing that might also be an issue , uh , cuz part of what you 're doing is you 're getting a a spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds . um , and so it might matter how fast someone was talking for instance . you know , if you if if if there 's a lot of phones in one second maybe you 'll get a a really good sampling of all these different things , and and , uh , on the other hand if someone 's talking slowly maybe you 'd need more . so i do n't know if you have some samples of faster or slower speech but it might make a difference . i do n't know . grad c : uh , yeah , i do n't i do n't think the ti - digits data that i have , um , i is would be appropriate for that . professor d : yeah , probably not . yeah . grad c : but what do you what about if i w i fed it through some kind of , um , speech processing algorithm that changed the speech rate ?"
