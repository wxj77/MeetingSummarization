    "answer": "helen mary jones am : i think , chair , the minister has already answered what the\u2014 . but thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings , or , indeed , young people who ca n't access educational settings , what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone ? kirsty williams am : yes , that is correct . so , our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure\u2014which i think , if we 're honest , we have to acknowledge is what we 're looking at\u2014we would expect school staff\u2014well-being staff , for instance in school\u2014to be doing check-ins\u2014phone check-ins , potentially , or facetime check-ins , with students , just to keep in touch with them as we go forward . we 'll be looking to promote amongst young people a range of online facilities that are available\u2014so , for instance , meic website\u2014so , looking to use a variety of platforms . we do , of course , have the formal nhs counselling services . i 'm concerned , of course , that for some children their access to their counsellor is via their school . we know that , and we 're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists\u2014online counselling tools that children already use because they do n't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor . they 're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue , as far as possible , those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered , and their worries . i think we have to remember that this is a really worrying time for children and young people . one of the reasons , again , that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible\u2014and teachers have been working so hard to do that\u2014is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we 've needed and wanted to maintain . children will have worries about their own health ; they 'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents ; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves . so , we need to understand , and i think we will also have to recognise , that this support will have to be ongoing once we 're back to normal , and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience . they are incredibly resilient , and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages . they are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands ' and things like that than even adults have been . so , they are incredibly resilient , but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them . helen mary jones am : can i just\u2014 ? just a supplementary to that\u2014you 've mentioned already , kirsty , the importance of youth services , and , particularly thinking voluntarily youth services , you 've given the commitment , when were talking about mudiad ysgolion meithrin earlier , that services that are part-funded by grants through the welsh government , for example , thinking of the national youth voluntary service\u2014will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well ? obviously , local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open , but , in terms of the direct support from welsh government , can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time ? kirsty williams am : no formal decision has been made , but if people are in receipt of a government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public\u2014 helen mary jones am : because it 's not safe . kirsty williams am : \u2014because it 's not safe to do so , i do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying , 'we 'll have our money back , thank you very much . ' lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . helen mary jones am : that will make a lot of people happy , thank you . [ laughter . ] kirsty williams am : as i said , we are facing unprecedented circumstances . the normal rules of engagement have to change and , those organisations , we 'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal , and we would n't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that . our call to the youth service is a call to arms , though . when we 're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children , they have a valuable role to play and i know that local government and the council for wales of voluntary youth services are already in discussion about how youth services\u2014 . many of our youth services work on an outreach basis . those traditional youth clubs , because of austerity , are not necessarily there anymore , so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work , and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier ."
