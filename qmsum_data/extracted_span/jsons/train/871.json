    "answer": "grad c : for perl if you want to just do perl . if you wanted to use the structured xml query language , that 's a different thing . and it 's a set of tools that let you specify given the d - ddt dtd of the document , um , what sorts of structural searches you want to do . so you want to say that , you know , you 're looking for , um , a tag within a tag within a particular tag that has this particular text in it , um , and , uh , refers to a particular value . and so the point is n't that an end - user , who is looking for a query like you specified , would n't program it in this language . what you would do is , someone would build a tool that used that as a library . so that they so that you would n't have to construct the internal representations yourself . phd f : is a see , i think the kinds of questions , at least in the next to the end of this year , are there may be a lot of different ones , but they 'll all have a similar nature . they 'll be looking at either a word - level prosodic , uh , an a value , grad c : mm - hmm . phd f : like a continuous value , like the slope of something . but you know , we 'll do something where we some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort o uh , either at the word - level or at the segment - level , grad c : right . phd f : or or something like that . they 're not gon na be at the phone - level and they 're no not gon na be at the frame - level when we get done with sort of giving them simpler shapes and things . and so the main thing is just being able well , i guess , the two goals . um , one that chuck mentioned is starting out with something that we do n't have to start over , that we do n't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions , grad c : right . phd f : and being able to at least get enough , uh , information out on where we condition the location of features on information that 's in the kind of file that you put up there . and that would that would do it , grad c : yeah . i think that there are quick and dirty solutions , phd f : i mean , for me . grad c : and then there are long - term , big - infrastructure solutions . and so we want to try to pick something that lets us do a little bit of both ."
