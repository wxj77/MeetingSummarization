    "answer": "user interface : and that yeah . industrial designer : project manager : also good for animals . user interface : yeah . see . things . . why 's my screen crazy ? industrial designer : uh well let 's see . i 'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . project manager : marketing : industrial designer : just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . i 've more information on possible materials um as well . what we can and can not do . um but let 's just wait for this to load up and i 'll show you what we 're talking about here . okay . the details of the components ' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . the underside , that 's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it 's getting and will do what you tell it . um so much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . when you press a key um you complete a specific connection . the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . right . pretty clear . transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light . the sensor in the tv can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . this is the circuit board from the other side . um the lower part of it , i do n't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . um you can see the circuit board itself . that 's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . um what you do is you have , do n't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . these are the actual keys that are being pressed . they close the electric circuit . that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . that would be behind here . um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that marketing : industrial designer : amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . um the way it works is that you have the keys here . the rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . and thus gives on the signal . now this is the simple version . um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . we are talking something more complicated of course , it 's going to be more expensive as well . and not only that . um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . um i 've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . so it 's pretty squishy . that would that would serve that purpose . marketing : spongy ?"
