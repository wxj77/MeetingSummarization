    "answer": "eluned morgan am : i think it is important . what we 've said is that we want to maintain that range of learning opportunities that is provided by eu funding . i think we 've got to be clear that we are not working to this scenario . i think we 've got to\u2014 . the uk government have made us some promises and they 've made some commitments , and we need to hold them to that , and so let 's keep the pressure on . the moment we start saying , 'no , it 's all going to be okay , we 'll sort ourselves out'\u2014i think that would be a huge mistake . we have been promised that we will not lose a penny as a result of brexit , and we need to make sure that we keep them to that commitment . i think it was quite interesting to hear what philip hammond said yesterday when he was in wales , saying that the money that we will receive will depend on the future shape of the economy , which implies that he has no idea what 's going to happen there , and that that shared prosperity fund will be designed around the deal . well , that 's really not what we 're interested in . we were made some promises , and we need them to commit to those promises . i think we have some real concerns about the shared prosperity fund not really following through on the commitments that were made during the brexit referendum . but , in terms of the replacements , we 'd be looking at about \u00a315 million a year , and that would be a huge impact for us , but we 're not looking at that\u2014i do n't think we should be\u2014because they made some promises . john griffiths am : so , could you say that , if they keep their promises , then at least that level of funding would be maintained ? eluned morgan am : i think that would be a minimum , but that 's just one aspect of it . that 's not including the whole workplace learning money on top of that . lynne neagle am : thank you . suzy , you had a supplementary . suzy davies am : yes , just very quickly on the multi-annual point , obviously i recognise that we 're talking about six or seven-year cycles with europe , and i completely take the point that you do n't really know from year to year what your budget 's going to be , but welsh government does make multi-annual commitments . i think you did it yesterday , actually\u2014the capital commitment is over more than one year . how are you able to do that and yet not quite feel confident that you can do that with\u2014well , both your sectors , really ? eluned morgan am : i think it 's probably easier to do with capital than it is with revenue , so that 's what would make the difference . but it's\u2014 . these institutions are interested in revenue , because that 's what supports the staff . the one thing we all know is that employment opportunities today\u2014the transitional nature of employment and the fact that people are not getting the kind of contracts that we 'd like them to get\u2014that makes their lives very precarious and they 're less likely , then , to be committed to those institutions . i think it 's a really , really concerning thing , because what makes these institutions work well is their staff , so that makes life very , very difficult without that multi-annual commitment . suzy davies am : they also have to raise some of their own money as well\u2014we must n't forget that . eluned morgan am : no , i think that 's right , and i think that there 's more that these institutions can do in terms of their own funding and being more responsive to employers and the need for skills in their areas . suzy davies am : okay , thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : so , given the precarious state of planning for the finances , are you considering letting universities charge eu students international fees ?"
