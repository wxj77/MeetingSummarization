    "query": "<s> what were the components discussed during the presentation of the component design that were required for the construction of the remote control ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : i have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction . marketing : industrial designer : uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera , it 's like uh it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just uh uh , you know , if you if it falls down , then it does n't break . so it should be strong . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that . and it should be recyclable . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh and uh , marketing : mm-hmm . good point . industrial designer : yeah , and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components . and uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit . marketing : industrial designer : uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it 's like the it 's like the heart of the remote controller . if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . and it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures . suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures . and uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility . and the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m i think it 's it 's like a battery , capacitor . can you go on to the next slide , please ? marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . a battery uh , i would like to suggest one thing uh if we uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it ca n't l it ca n't charge much . marketing : mm-hmm ."
