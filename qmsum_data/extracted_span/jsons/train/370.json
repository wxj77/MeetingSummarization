    "answer": "project manager : okay , so mm so well done for the presentations . so we need to take some de decisions about um about what we 're going to do . user interface : project manager : so i i propose that you go to the whiteboard user interface : yeah . project manager : and we 're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product user interface : okay . project manager : and uh where superman go banana and uh user interface : project manager : uh extra func functionalities such as wheels , um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device , industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : i do i do n't remember you call it ? industrial designer : that 's right . the basis station . that 's right . project manager : basis station , yeah . uh so um so we 're going for a stylish banana shape . user interface : yeah , so , i guess you wan na hold like the way the end of the banana you wan na kind of hold as ma you maybe wan na kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you do n't want it to point kind of towards the floor . project manager : yeah , right . user interface : so you know , so if you have like marketing : what about what about this shape ? more or less . industrial designer : there 's less space on this to put with the buttons . project manager : i if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could marketing : yeah , but how many buttons do we need ? project manager : the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . if you do n't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you do n't have to do it in fact , it 's better . so ti time is running , industrial designer : uh what about a project manager : we have to we have to we have to to move forward . so let 's skip to uh this uh this this this idea . yeah . user interface : okay , so project manager : so we have this . user interface : so project manager : we have a a basis um , how do you call it ? industrial designer : the base station . project manager : a base station . industrial designer : right . project manager : we 'll have a base station extra uh on the side . user interface : okay , so i guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . yeah . project manager : uh , we have a r_f_ for um for beeping for beeping . industrial designer : that 's right , yeah , we need that , yeah . project manager : we need b r_f_ to beep . user interface : okay , so it 's uh project manager : so we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : basis station . project manager : basis station , thank you . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . user interface : alright , so we need uh okay . project manager : can you go quickly please ? user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . so we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo uh button . user interface : yeah . yeah , which i think it 's it 's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , industrial designer : turbo button . project manager : yeah , on the th yeah , maybe here . user interface : so you have project manager : and the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance . user interface : yes . yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here . project manager : and and you have two wheels . user interface : so yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel . project manager : okay right . good . so no lcd . user interface : and , uh no lcd . project manager : okay great . um . very good . user interface : oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well . industrial designer : okay . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh for the remote ? user interface : yeah . project manager : oh , just the switch , industrial designer : remotes do n't have power on off switch . project manager : no f not for the tv for the tv . uh so you user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . s no , that 'll be controlled by the those buttons 'll be there already , yeah . marketing : what a user interface : where ? industrial designer : means on the remote . project manager : on the side . user interface : okay . industrial designer : because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . they are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you do n't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . user interface : well , i dunno if the traditional user is gon na buy a a banana remote in the first place , you know . industrial designer : oh , yeah . that 's that 's another issue which i did n't think of . user interface : y i mean you need to kind of keep it um industrial designer : but you know our targets are very high , means fifty million euros is the profit which we want make . marketing : what about user interface : yeah , how many of these did we wan na sell ? i ca n't remember , industrial designer : twenty five . project manager : twenty five . industrial designer : twelve point five is the profit on one . marketing : user interface : yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell ? industrial designer : uh forty th four . point point four million ? marketing : four millions ? user interface : four point four million . industrial designer : point four million . user interface : that 's a lot of fruit . industrial designer : in the market . user interface : marketing : what about a project manager : yeah . so . well . no . time is running , we have to close the meeting in a few minutes . user interface : okay . project manager : so , okay , the next step , you can come back to your seat . user interface : okay . project manager : the next step is to go for to f is to go to uh to building a prototype , based on this , okay ? user interface : okay . project manager : so next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . you have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : uh marketing expert uh have to go to product evaluation . user interface : project manager : okay ? marketing : i wo what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ? project manager : it 's too difficult . marketing : it 's too difficult but people like innovation and that 's really uh innovative and i do n't know if it would cost a lot , just a few five words . project manager : it 's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so t it 's in the next prototype so let 's skip it . marketing : okay . industrial designer : for the future prototypes . project manager : yeah , maybe , for the n if if if it it works well , we 'll go for uh an orange one . user interface : that can be the t that can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando . industrial designer : project manager : yeah yeah , honour the fruit . marketing : plus plus , okay . maybe objective banana ? project manager : okay . user interface : project manager : thanks very much . we 'll see n next meeting . bye . user interface : okay . industrial designer : so meeting 's over ? user interface : yep . we have to go design the prototype . industrial designer : okay . okay . okay . thank you . project manager : thank you . marketing : thank you ."
