    "answer": "project manager : wait for the marketing director actually , so . anyways . uh . see , shall we wait ? i 'm not sure if he 's late or delayed or whatever , so i 'm gon na start soon , we have now do n't have much time anyway . user interface : oh , there he is . industrial designer : okay , project manager : there you are , industrial designer : we marketing : sorry , project manager : okay . marketing : a little bit of pl little problem with computer . project manager : uh no problem . we 're about to start , so have a seat . okay , welcome again . marketing : . project manager : today , functional design phase . i 'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting . okay , that was just to get to know each other , have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , so i put the minutes on the i made on the on the p the the project share , so if you wan na review them , they 're there . i will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wan na take back you can find it there . anyways , um today three presentations , from every one of you . um after that i got some new project requirements from project board , so we 're gon na go af go after over this later . but i wan na start with uh stuff you did first , so we can see what everybody came up with . and after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so . who would like wan na go first ? marketing : yeah , sure , no problem . project manager : take it . user interface : go ahead . marketing : um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh project manager : anyway , let 's see what you have . marketing : yeah . um okay , project manager : uh it 's still a bit open . marketing : i want to open the my s oh no . project manager : you should close it on your own notebook , i guess . yeah . so there ? marketing : oh no , project manager : okay . marketing : that 's okay . uh slide show . yes . the functional requirements , it 's uh uh very important for uh the user , he he wants to yeah . the the method we used uh it it 's not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use uh , um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men , and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what 's uh important . uh project manager : if i can cut in , is it people or men ? marketing : people , project manager : is it people , okay . marketing : sorry . project manager : 'cause i thought it was only men , marketing : both women and men , project manager : so marketing : yeah . project manager : 'kay . marketing : okay . uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . um user interface : that 's pretty shocking uh . project manager : so we have to s we have to do something about that . marketing : yeah , and yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , and um they use yeah , they use zap a lot , um uh fifty percent say they only so that 's the most important things . project manager : okay . marketing : um oh yeah , not all of it is it on mine on my powerpoint presentation , project manager : okay , just talk ahead . marketing : but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : it 's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use . uh less important is tel teletext , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : uh um they use it , but it 's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh project manager : okay , that 's okay . user interface : marketing : and but not important is the channel selection , the the hmm ? project manager : that 's a little weird . marketing : oh , user interface : which channel selection ? marketing : the the no no no no no , that 's very important , but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings project manager : okay , marketing : and uh project manager : we can we can hide those under a menu or something , user interface : oh , okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : um new preferences preferences . uh um um beep to find your control , was project manager : that 's like a button on your tv ? marketing : that was in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they can not find a rem their remote control , project manager : remote , okay . marketing : so uh i think it 's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . and another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to let 's go to channel one and uh that 's uh kind of things . project manager : okay . marketing : and they want maybe an uh lcd screen um to to look it um wh what 's on every channel uh and uh what do i want with it ? user interface : project manager : we wan na have a little preview on the remote control . preview what 's on the channel . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . user interface : is that manageable ? 'cause it sounds pretty expensive too . project manager : that sounds too marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's possible , but uh i think it 's expensive , but do continue . user interface : okay . marketing : yeah . um uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so i can uh i dunno , so i can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what i uh so , the remote mu must see or um must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , project manager : okay , you do n't set it yourself , marketing : so i can zap t to project manager : it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . marketing : what ? project manager : you want the you want it to be programmed , for example y programmed f marketing : yeah . project manager : or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? marketing : yeah . project manager : let 's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , marketing : recognise project manager : so it recognises your favourite channel . marketing : yeah . yeah , that 's uh what my personal preference like . project manager : okay , so it 's it it does it recognise itself , you do n't have to set it okay . marketing : itself . maybe it 's easier to to sell it , but project manager : okay . marketing : i do n't know it 's manageable , but we will uh we will see . project manager : i see . marketing : yeah , it 's a little bit uh it 's the end of it . project manager : okay . marketing : it 's a little bit uh i lost it , user interface : okay . marketing : the computer uh crashed , project manager : no problem , it 's it 's okay , that 's yeah , go ahead . user interface : shall i go ? okay . marketing : yeah . user interface : so , some technical functions . marketing : darn computer . user interface : basically i have some issues which you discussed earlier . uh let 's just start with the method . marketing : yeah . user interface : it sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues . so the things i 'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that 's pretty much covered . we can do that . what goes wrong at the user . gets the remote control . where is the remote control ? we 've all had it once , i want to watch some television , marketing : yeah . user interface : where 's the remote control ? that was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , marketing : yeah . project manager : that seems very good . user interface : a really good idea . uh these are just the issues . i come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . searches for the button . there are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . marketing : mm uh . user interface : there 's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you do n't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find uh something for that , project manager : okay , so have it more make it more durable actually . okay . user interface : yes . uh covered that . oh yes , user presses the button . um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . so you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that , project manager : okay , so the buttons should be user interface : so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah . user interface : and possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger project manager : wow . the s yeah . make it make them bigger . even more durable uh . user interface : so this is basically what i h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others . uh project manager : okay . user interface : this i pretty much covered . so what we want to go to is not this one , project manager : yeah , it 's true . user interface : but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons . marketing : yeah . user interface : that 's basically uh what i had in mind . so project manager : yeah , that 's clear . user interface : this is not the final design , project manager : no , of course uh user interface : this is just a general idea of how i 'd like to see uh basically the general idea . project manager : yeah . i must say that it hmm . user interface : so that was it . project manager : that was it . okay , that was good . so we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing , user interface : yeah , i think it 's a really good idea . project manager : so user interface : yeah . project manager : the other aspects , we 'll just see how what you came up with and what 's possible for that budget . user interface : yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : okay , that 's fine . um . okay , now work a little with me . okay . well , project manager : industrial designer : let 's start it as it is . okay , uh the method . there are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? i 'll tell you why that 's important to me . um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that 's why i also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh i heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . project manager : yeah . of course , hmm . industrial designer : so it 's that 's not as easy as it s might look like . user interface : okay . industrial designer : uh material study , i 'm working on that um for the the costs . i have to check out how far i can go with that . normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , i think we can just go on with that . um then i 've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . the more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper . project manager : you mean integrate them all into the circuit board . okay . industrial designer : exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that 's cheaper . project manager : yeah , okay . industrial designer : so we have to make something that 's not too difficult in design again . project manager : so you have industrial designer : this is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . you have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . the switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a morse code , that 's how you should see it . the morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . you have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it ? uh a light in indication , light that you know that it 's functioning . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh here again , that 's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different morse code when some button is pressed . that makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . uh i do n't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light . project manager : okay . okay . that was it ? industrial designer : that was it . project manager : i 'll get back to my thing then . uh okay , back this up to the screen . so i got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet , nowadays people do n't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either well , i do n't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it . user interface : yeah . project manager : but i do n't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example . just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . it 's not important anymore . um we 're targeting young people now , because our um this is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , which are um the younger people were defined under forty . marketing : yeah . project manager : i so i think it 's that 's also good with the fashion and everything , so yeah . marketing : yeah , and they want to pay for it project manager : they want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . marketing : and uh project manager : if they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they 're actually gon na spend uh spend money on it . marketing : with more where with more technical specifications project manager : yeah . marketing : in the project manager : see how far we can go with it anyway , so marketing : yeah . project manager : and one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow , but i 'm not sure if we i think we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody 's taste . so with that concept i started thinking , so why not just steal nokia 's idea and just make changeable covers for your i mean those cost hardly anything i think , and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design . and sell the covers separately , for example . that 's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . so you do n't have to i think you do n't have to make entire remote controls . we make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : so that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . so just i 'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . would you like to share ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : no , i think this is a good idea . project manager : okay . industrial designer : but marketing : but oh ? user interface : is it manageable ? is it easy ? industrial designer : go ahead . marketing : yeah , with with an lcd screen you can project manager : oh yeah . i think we should lose the lcd screen , industrial designer : y yes , i think so too . project manager : like you said . i think for example it 's it 's huge i think the lcd is huge , user interface : yeah . marketing : why ? nokia w project manager : it consumes batteries like hell . i think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . user interface : and it costs too much to fabricate , project manager : it costs a lot , i think . user interface : so we 're on a tight budget here . industrial designer : okay , uh project manager : what we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an lcd screen but with a preview , marketing : okay . project manager : but y i 'm not sure if it 's even possible . for example , a little tv guide . like you have a little just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . project manager : so you can use your remote as a tv guide . i 'm not sure it 's even possible , industrial designer : hmm . i have to check that out , project manager : but maybe okay , make it industrial designer : i 'm not sure . project manager : yeah , find a little compromise in that , but what did i write down ? marketing : yeah . project manager : i think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your tv industrial designer : that must be possible . project manager : and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . i think it 's easy to implement , we should go for that . industrial designer : i 'm sorry , project manager : uh speech recognition . user interface : and it 's industrial designer : whe where do you wan na hit the t_ you wan na we want a button on the television . project manager : i thin yeah , i mean where else should you put it ? industrial designer : in th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : because that 's not possible uh . project manager : but how are you gon na use that if your i mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gon na press where are you gon na press the button ? industrial designer : uh . yeah . exactly . user interface : maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . project manager : a slap-on sticker . oh , you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your tv . marketing : mm uh . project manager : yeah , that could be possible . user interface : yeah , exactly . project manager : a little little box you can attach to your tv is fine then , okay . industrial designer : okay , then uh i 'd i 'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that 's uh determines everything i 'm gon na do . project manager : i think it 's universal . i think we should go for universal , industrial designer : if not project manager : because apparently we 're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . industrial designer : okay . project manager : i think universal remote control should be possible . marketing : yeah . um industrial designer : okay , then i go for that . marketing : everyone uh wants to buy it , so we w project manager : yeah , i think we 're targeting everyone , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so remote industrial designer : okay . no , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it 's fine with me , but then i know what to look for . project manager : okay , universal is good . speech recognition , i think it 's very hard , because we 're selling across multiple countries . so i think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it 's very hard to do . marketing : yeah . or one . user interface : and it 's marketing : or when you say one two uh i it uh it 's enough , project manager : yeah , but i do n't see arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever . marketing : right ? but oh yeah . user interface : besides that , the technology is n't really super yet , so that is a problem in implementing this . project manager : it 's yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's not a mature technology , i think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , marketing : okay . project manager : so user interface : it 's a good idea , but it 's just not i do n't think the market 's ripe for that yet . project manager : i do n't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . industrial designer : uh-huh . project manager : what else do we have ? marketing : yeah . project manager : um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . so the the the symbols wo n't fade , industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : maybe a little harder plastic industrial designer : exactly . project manager : or especially li we do n't industrial designer : i already noted that . project manager : maybe we do n't have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , so those always fade first . industrial designer : mm , okay . okay . project manager : mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . let 's see . industrial designer : if we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . project manager : for example ? industrial designer : that 's fo is uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language . project manager : well , we 're not we 're not targeting older people , marketing : yeah . project manager : we should remember that . everything we target is under forty , industrial designer : that 's okay , okay . project manager : you assume that that they read correctly and i think they 're the most important thing about young people is that they 're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , so industrial designer : uh okay . user interface : but should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the project manager : no , of course . no , i think it 's just something you you put over them , because yeah we c yeah , you ca well , tha that 's not a that 's not a bad that 's not even marketing : but every user interface : that 's a problem with the with the text then . project manager : it 's not even a bad idea . i mean , for example , if you 're if you 're into the durability issue you could user interface : project manager : for example , if your buttons are faded , after i mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . uh i 'm not sure it 's it 's hard to make . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so it 's a good and a bad idea . industrial designer : uh but i know that the buttons are like a nokia telephone on uh one sleeve , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so you do n't have to change your whole cover . uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . user interface : oh yeah , i know what you mean . industrial designer : know what i mean ? it works the same as a nokia telephone , it 's it 's in my uh 'kay . project manager : yeah , i know , it 's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , marketing : yeah . project manager : okay . yeah , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : exactly . project manager : that 's what i something i have to look into . either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , i 'm not sure which which is easier , industrial designer : hmm . project manager : so um anyway , yeah , this is what we 're gon na do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let 's see what we let 's see we so you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . i want some you should do some trend-watching , because even if we 're if we 're gon na do those covers and everything , what people really want , that 's what we need to know in this phase , marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : because that 's gon na be the essential final design that we 're gon na come up with . marketing : okay . project manager : um yeah , i think user interface is fairly obvious . i mean it should be very intuitive , user interface : pretty straightforward . project manager : s yeah , it should speak for itself . uh for example i bought a remote control last week with a new tv , it was it l it 's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , industrial designer : project manager : and i 'm total tv new , anyway . so i think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever , they 're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your tv . user interface : is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , project manager : industrial designer : yeah . user interface : because we 're working with different types of television , so we 're going to work with that ? project manager : that is true . industrial designer : i do n't think so . project manager : no , that 's true . industrial designer : no , i do n't think so . because the television needs to respond to the signal , project manager : yeah , that 's true . user interface : it 's an in-built menu , industrial designer : and if it does n't know how , it 's user interface : is n't it ? yes . industrial designer : exactly , that 's not possible . user interface : so basically project manager : i 'm not sure if it 's impossible , user interface : we project manager : but uh there 's a chance it 's not , so . user interface : or we could use a double-sided for less used functions project manager : a double-sided remote control ? user interface : you project manager : i do n't think that 's useful . user interface : yeah , with the cover . i it 's basically an idea to overcome these issues , project manager : yeah , but then you 're gon na have a lot of wasted buttons . user interface : because project manager : for example you have a sony tv and the half of the buttons wo n't function if you have a for a sony that wo n't for a philips tv . user interface : no , but basic functions marketing : yeah . user interface : but functions which are not frequently used . project manager : i do n't think we should user interface : because if we use a universal remote control , we 're going to have to have most buttons on it , project manager : yeah , for exam user interface : so project manager : i 'm not s marketing : mm yeah . project manager : yeah , for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their tvs , not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , but you ca n't you can not take into consideration all the different brands of tvs . industrial designer : but that might be broken . project manager : i think there 's i think there is a standard for example between uh industrial designer : hmm . project manager : because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands . especially the big ones , the big brands , industrial designer : hmm . hmm . project manager : so . 'cause everybody i have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so i think i 'm not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it 's possible . uh i think just a b industrial designer : mm okay . project manager : and the navigation is very basic , it 's usually the same thing . industrial designer : mm . but i think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . for instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that 's in it . project manager : yeah . yeah , that 's true . i think so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : because otherwise you 'll lose functions by buying our marketing : yeah . yeah . project manager : uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , i think it 's possible , just the way how to . industrial designer : okay , i thi i think so too . marketing : yeah , yeah . project manager : yeah , then then you could do everything i suppose , because usually the tvs have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it 's okay . industrial designer : and i think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . for instance uh sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . project manager : yeah . yeah i think it should be a little distinct from everything else , industrial designer : we should not do that . project manager : because it 's either it 's both mayb industrial designer : exactly . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , project manager : maybe the shape can be a little different . user interface : i have some ideas . i have some ideas . project manager : maybe it 's a little more curves or whatever . industrial designer : mm that 's your uh division . marketing : um yeah . and uh with different colours uh . project manager : so um user interface : i 'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that i have . project manager : yeah , this . not sure what marketing : okay . project manager : because we have forty minutes , i 'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so . user interface : i heard a beep go . project manager : yeah , but it was n't me , it was him closing something . marketing : yeah . project manager : so anyway , yeah , we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . i mean what do you want , do you want , but user interface : yeah , but we like some some curves or project manager : yeah , may maybe something like this . but though smooth inside . so you have the transmitter here for example . user interface : yeah . project manager : let 's see that you what would be handy . i think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . marketing : uh . and a light uh project manager : let 's see one , two god damn it . user interface : oh , we get the general ideas , yes . project manager : yeah , okay . another one here . let 's see what i think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here . user interface : yeah , and since you 're holding it like this , i suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume project manager : think it 's like this . marketing : volume . project manager : withi within the yeah , just take it . user interface : yeah yeah . so you have the up channel the down channel the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ? project manager : do you take triangles or marketing : uh it 's it 's fine , i think . project manager : um i think it should be i think it user interface : this is basically what people are accustomed to , project manager : maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . user interface : so industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , but this is just a g general idea . marketing : oh d project manager : yeah . user interface : uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . project manager : yeah , in the middle . it 's it 's usually uh there , but mm . user interface : whoa . industrial designer : perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it 's lost , for people that are deaf . they they wo n't hear the the beep . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , but for example if it 's lost in your armchair , we 'll not see the flash . user interface : you wo n't be able to find it . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and flash takes up a lot of batteries again . industrial designer : uh . yeah , it 's true , but it 's it 's only has to do so when you press the button that it 's lost . marketing : just project manager : yeah . user interface : we could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up . industrial designer : so . deaf people ? marketing : and l_e_d_ uh on it . project manager : yeah , i thought about for deaf people for example , so . we could do that . uh let 's see . marketing : just a light on it or user interface : so we have the basic channels we 've got here , uh the power button somewhere over here ? project manager : oh yeah , it 's true . um that thing should be central . marketing : very important . project manager : you should n't be you uh should n't press it by accident , but it should n't be stacked away somewhere . user interface : i usually press it on top . marketing : that 's it 's project manager : yeah . user interface : at least that 's what i 'm accustomed to . industrial designer : i have another idea , project manager : yeah , like that 's gon na work . industrial designer : i 'm not sure if it 's possible . marketing : and user interface : what would you like to ? project manager : yeah , i thought maybe we should move the buttons down marketing : but you r project manager : and put it here for example marketing : and you are reading from the t project manager : to marketing : you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . project manager : from top to bottom . yeah , that 's true , marketing : yeah , project manager : you should marketing : so it 's project manager : i think the bu the power button should be on top , marketing : yeah . project manager : 'cause it 's the first thing you do , turn it on . so power button on top . um user interface : okay , mute button . is that somewhere here ? project manager : mute . do we hardly i think it should be at the bottom somewhere . user interface : is that used often ? marketing : so i it 's user interface : the mute button ? do people use that often ? marketing : sorry ? project manager : mute . turn the sound off . marketing : no , it 's no . user interface : 'cause uh i 'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here , at least in general , marketing : uh . hmm . user interface : but project manager : i do n't think it 's important , but i think it i think it should be you c user interface : it 's not that important , no . project manager : you could put it somewhere here . marketing : or or with the volume selection . project manager : no , because it yeah , people are accustomed to that , marketing : around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection . project manager : it 's can i have that ? that 's j user interface : sure . marketing : i do n't know where exactly , project manager : take this out and here see marketing : but project manager : uh are we gon na take triangles anyway ? i 'm drawing triangles , but marketing : user interface : that 's pretty much what people are accustomed to , project manager : yeah , user interface : are n't they ? project manager : it 's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . so anyway , i think this is should be the channels and or sh user interface : well , i 'm accustomed to the channels being on top . marketing : no . yeah . project manager : here , industrial designer : yeah , me too . project manager : okay . okay , marketing : yeah , that 's better . project manager : should we chan marketing : on the right . project manager : okay , this two , channel up and down . industrial designer : shall we uh also look if it 's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? that you do n't have to buy new batteries if every project manager : well , marketing : yeah . project manager : for that is it 's on one part it 's um it 's a good thing to recharge it marketing : maybe it 's more ex expensive . industrial designer : mm , yeah . project manager : maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . you have just put penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it 's an it 's it 's it 's very annoying . user interface : but is n't that expensive in the entire package ? industrial designer : but that 's already possible . marketing : yeah . project manager : i 'm not sure y i 'm not sure it 's if it 's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . because if it 's it 's uh useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you do n't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wan na watch tv now , you wan na be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour . industrial designer : yes . yes . okay . uh you could make a device , but i 'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , project manager : i think i have a nice idea . industrial designer : but it you 're the remote also can act as a recharger . so then you can choose , you have every decision . know what i mean ? project manager : not exactly uh . industrial designer : you can uh put in normal penlites , rechargeable penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire . marketing : hmm . yeah yeah . project manager : i think it 's uh it 's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the tv . could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . industrial designer : so but marketing : yeah , that 's g industrial designer : but i think that will cost a lot . project manager : i 'm not sure . industrial designer : uh a normal wire would be better . project manager : a what ? industrial designer : like a like a p_d_a_ , a hand-held . you can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , project manager : well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal industrial designer : you do n't need basic station . yes . project manager : or so you could put that on a tv for example . industrial designer : that is possible , that 's true . project manager : it could be very flat , could be very small . marketing : but which project manager : it 's a very small yeah , i 'm drawing it big now , but so you can put your remote on flat for example . and at the backside of remote just just just a little hole marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : for example um you just put it down , it recharges for example . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : i do n't think it 's very expensive . user interface : but again , is n't that too expensive ? marketing : yeah . user interface : 'cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station industrial designer : project manager : i 'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that 's what he r that 's that you that 's what you buy yourself . industrial designer : yes . i 'm going to try to find that out . i 'm not sure if there 's information available on this , project manager : it 's just an idea , we have to find out if it 's possible . industrial designer : but marketing : but user interface : and do people actually want that ? to pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ? marketing : yeah , they want to pay for it . project manager : do they want but they want a rechargeable one ? marketing : yeah . project manager : i 'm not sure , you should find out if it 's if rechargeable is important . marketing : th uh there was not a el ask esque project manager : yeah . industrial designer : hmm . these are uh comfort issues . so i think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort . marketing : but project manager : they want to pay for comfort , industrial designer : well , this is comfort . project manager : we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , marketing : but f hmm . project manager : um and yeah , we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station . industrial designer : hmm . yeah . exactly . i think this is a brilliant product . project manager : i think it would be good actually . industrial designer : i would buy it myself . project manager : i like the beep part anyway . marketing : project manager : let 's go through the industrial designer : i like the covers . that 's a brilliant idea . marketing : user interface : can can we save this or project manager : covers is covers is good . industrial designer : i never thought project manager : yeah , it 's oh we can save this . up and saved . we even saved the ant . um okay . so user interface : marketing : project manager : what we have is you have i think you have to do a lot of work on if it 's possible for the cost . industrial designer : i hope if i have information about that , project manager : maybe yeah , industrial designer : i 'm gon na project manager : or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : we are going for twenty five euros sales price , marketing : yeah , okay . project manager : but just try to find out what they 're willing to pay for it , because if they 're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , marketing : yeah yeah yeah . industrial designer : mm . yeah . project manager : uh we just have to see what it looks like . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i would like to make a decision . what it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it project manager : yeah , if you have some financial information that that 'd be nice , industrial designer : and exactly , i need it . project manager : so . hmm . user interface : could you post some other essentials of what people want , so that i can work with some buttons , where to put it project manager : marketing : yeah . user interface : you seem to have information on that , i 'd like to uh see some of it . industrial designer : was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ? project manager : no , it was n't was n't allo user interface : no , it 's not . no . project manager : it was possible , industrial designer : not . project manager : not allowed , so . so that 's um why i 'm not sure that you 're allowed to share documents on the on the draft . marketing : yeah . my computer crashed , industrial designer : yeah , okay . project manager : i do n't care . i have n't heard any complaints yet , user interface : oh , your computer . okay . marketing : i lost my uh presentation , project manager : so . um marketing : but i have the uh user interface : well , i have your powerpoint presentation , i can get some inf information out of that . marketing : yeah , but i here i have the the s the homepage of uh our internet , user interface : let 's see . project manager : yeah , the oh , they inc uh marketing : and here is my project manager : they include the new one . or just for you . user interface : oh , where would we marketing : here is my marketing report , project manager : oh marketing : maybe you ca you can look at uh that project manager : no , i did n't have that . marketing : and user interface : where would we want the uh teletext button ? marketing : ah yeah . user interface : because we decided that it 's n not that important . project manager : all it tells just let 's make make a new marketing : and one user interface : do we put it somewhere over here ? project manager : tick the new one . um other side . yeah , let 's increase it a little because marketing : and uh wha what people want , i 've uh user interface : or maybe this is something for the next meeting , i can draw out some ideas . project manager : yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible marketing : i have another thing uh project manager : just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , user interface : yeah . project manager : so the more less important user interface : well , we have decided more or less the basic structure . project manager : more or less . user interface : i can put the other buttons in project manager : just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down and we 'll see what looks best . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : what uh what did you wan na say ? project manager : or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . marketing : yeah . um user interface : yeah . marketing : uh what i al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost , user interface : maybe another idea uh . marketing : but it it 's also for people , they want to learn it fast , industrial designer : mm . mm . marketing : not uh they want to project manager : yeah , so we do n't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . marketing : it 's yeah , it 's easy to learn user interface : yes , but it should cover all the functions , marketing : wi and uh user interface : so possibly , just an idea that popped in project manager : what we had function that what people do , marketing : um project manager : so . people change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn tv off and on , for example . that 's the basic fu that 's what you do i 'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented . user interface : yeah , but we could go a step further , marketing : and the if user interface : because some tvs have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . project manager : that 's true , but that 's what we stick under the menu button . everything is you say in every tv that 's configured under the menu . user interface : yes , but it because we 're making industrial designer : but that 's the question , is it ? marketing : um industrial designer : because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . project manager : yeah , but industrial designer : if it is n't , then we can not reach it . user interface : we need to adjust to the technology . project manager : but i think most modern tvs have it in their menu . industrial designer : i think so too . i think so too . user interface : true . industrial designer : uh is n't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? if you rule out functions , then uh and that gets known , then people are not gon na buy it . user interface : no , i thi industrial designer : then the consumer bond or something says uh you can not do this and that with it . that 's a bad bad com commercial marketing : if um project manager : uh we 'll we 'll see what we can come up with . industrial designer : for okay . marketing : another thing i want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty . project manager : under forty . yeah ? industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : um on my report , i did n't uh ish i did n't show it in my uh presentation , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : because my computer crashed . project manager : yeah yeah . marketing : um they want to pay for an lcd screen and speech recognition . industrial designer : hmm . hmm . project manager : the want to pay for industrial designer : did they really said it like that ? those two things . marketing : i yeah . yeah , project manager : uh shall we ? industrial designer : do they realise how much that costs ? marketing : and industrial designer : that 's almost undoable . marketing : yeah . project manager : younger , age sixteen and forty five . user interface : oh , we 're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an lcd screen . marketing : uh but project manager : that 's all here , here it says industrial designer : no , that 's that 's . even if i if we have this lost unit , then we can not do it for that price . project manager : yeah , age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . marketing : if if they project manager : okay , so we 're not focusing on this . um all the interest in features , not really the l_c_ oh here . would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . hmm , okay ? industrial designer : yeah , that 's true . user interface : marketing : we can project manager : speech recognition is quite marketing : we can look at the possibilities for an uh lcd and uh project manager : yeah , just look at the possibilities then , marketing : i dunno . project manager : because if marketing : yeah . project manager : apparently it 's what people want , it 's supposed to be a luxurious remote , marketing : how much it will cost and project manager : maybe it 's not even that expensive . or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes . industrial designer : uh i marketing : um user interface : i doubt it , but industrial designer : but i really need finance information . project manager : me too . i mean we all do . marketing : it will come uh industrial designer : we all do . project manager : right . i think it 's something we should put into consideration . apparently it 's what people want , so . we should see if what it costs , if it 's possible . industrial designer : mm . uh . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring , marketing : different colours maybe . industrial designer : hmm . and the design , it should differ . marketing : but all industrial designer : this is philips , huh ? project manager : i have no clue . industrial designer : philips has this . project manager : i just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily . user interface : well , i had basically industrial designer : okay . hmm . uh . user interface : something like this . to make it kind of futuristic . industrial designer : mm . oh , i realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , project manager : i think it 's a very industrial designer : because i need to put all the electronics in it . project manager : sorry ? industrial designer : if we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : because i have to put all the electronics in it . project manager : okay . mm-hmm . yeah , but you have to j just keep in mind it should n't be too heavy . marketing : okay . project manager : i mean we can stick it in in there , i think . huh even if in the worst case we can even user interface : what kind of project manager : could you give me the pen back ? user interface : yeah , sure . project manager : so let 's say that people would want an lcd thing . let 's take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with . i 'll just make it a little bigger now . so a transmitter here . anyway . we could let 's say we have an lcd screen , people want an lcd screen . so then we should probably put it here . marketing : project manager : it does n't have to be really big , but just just have to be has to be there . think it 's a good place , people do n't marketing : if you 're reading from top to bottom , i think it 's better to put it uh at the top . project manager : no ? it 's not that uh it 's not the most important function , industrial designer : me too . marketing : it 's j project manager : it 's just an extra thing , it just you press the buttons on top , marketing : uh . but i if you if you are going to uh put the lcd on it , i think it 's very important to use it , industrial designer : but . project manager : because your finger is on top . marketing : uh because it 's use it uh project manager : how can you use an lcd screen ? marketing : but nee the function of it . so you can use it maximum , because uh it 's a lot it costs a lot . project manager : yeah , but why marketing : so project manager : i i 'm not sure . user interface : now it 's pretty much tucked away in your hand . project manager : uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , industrial designer : hmm . no . project manager : ri i 'm not sure wha i 'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like . user interface : i 'm industrial designer : m i personally would prefer it on the top . project manager : you would prefer it n okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : so we have three people saying it should be on top . okay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . industrial designer : but it hmm . project manager : anyways . marketing : it 's expensive to build it , project manager : uh this looks a little user interface : i 'm still not convinced of the marketing : you must use the maximum of it . project manager : about the lcds thing . user interface : yeah . project manager : well if it if it 's if it 's possible wi if it 's not too expensive , we should include it , industrial designer : they want it uh . project manager : because it 's it 's cool . industrial designer : we should just try to make that if it 's possible . if it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information . marketing : huh . uh . but uh industrial designer : also keep in mind again , the lcd screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , i do n't know what more and that needs space . so i have to look if that 's possible . marketing : yeah , i know uh . user interface : so basically industrial designer : but if we user interface : can i project manager : uh we have green now uh user interface : what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he would we like to press it in the middle ? project manager : or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom . marketing : in middle of it . in the middle . project manager : maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . i think this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons for example . for up and down , ma make it a circle on it , user interface : yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , project manager : because it marketing : yeah . user interface : because it 's basically the most important function . project manager : i think the channel button should be in the centre . marketing : it 's the most import yeah . project manager : channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . because it 's uh user interface : well , that would make them quite small . project manager : we 're not sure about the size anyway , user interface : so maybe you 'd put them here . project manager : just a general design . you can make it as big as you want . for example if you take uh user interface : yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like . project manager : let 's see . for example just industrial designer : if we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . it is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . project manager : yeah . marketing : . project manager : i do n't think if we if we even use an lcd screen , we need to , definitely . industrial designer : that might be an option . yeah , but if we need two batteries and an lcd screen , that means a lot of space that we need . project manager : yeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is . industrial designer : but it has to be a little bit heavier . project manager : the lcd does n't have to nee does n't need to be very big . industrial designer : okay . marketing : industrial designer : no , but the things behind it . space . project manager : mm let 's see . industrial designer : like a process uh . marketing : finish meeting now . project manager : finish meeting now . marketing : it 's on your computer . project manager : okay , we will . so either user interface : so would we like this or would we like the project manager : we either we have to decide what what people want . industrial designer : i like this one more . project manager : either this one , this this could be the luxurious one . so we have channel buttons here . i 'm just drawing something uh . uh i think this would this would look cool . you could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function 's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here . user interface : let 's see what we have here . marketing : or and uh what about speech recognition uh project manager : well you can just no , i 'm not sure if we can do that , marketing : yeah , yeah , project manager : but we could put a microphone in here for example . marketing : but or or an lcd or an uh speech . i think it 's lcd is better now . project manager : just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i 'll try to . project manager : but let 's cut the meeting for now yes . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : one more uh thing i 'd like to say , uh let 's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . user interface : okay . marketing : yeah , okay , yeah , industrial designer : shall we all try uh to think about a name ? user interface : so i think of a name . marketing : that 's project manager : yeah , let 's think of a name , okay . marketing : yeah , that 's okay . project manager : uh okay . marketing : oh , good . project manager : okay , at anyways , the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , user interface : so project manager : so there we go uh . user interface : yes , go and finish up and i 'll see you at lunch . project manager : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : good luck . project manager : yeah , to all . user interface : yeah . marketing : same . industrial designer : yeah , i 've do we uh save the ?"
