    "answer": "project manager : okay , that kind of brings us to this , let 's let 's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . um . industrial designer : okay . project manager : do we wan na go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ? marketing : oh the base , yeah . project manager : the base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ? industrial designer : i think the p user interface : i always feel like first i wan na know what it looks like , before 'cause if it 's something really really small , then it 's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up project manager : yeah , and we do n't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the tv . it 's not gon na be a huge universal remote . user interface : right . marketing : we need to decide , well so we can figure how big it 's gon na be , like exactly what buttons we want project manager : what size battery and user interface : well , the other thing is like even if it 's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , marketing : and exactly it could be like this . yes . user interface : 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that 's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . marketing : i 'd , well uh this one is really comfortable , like i like the sides whatever , user interface : are you gon na lose it easier ? marketing : because but if we have the um , the locator , then we do n't have to worry about that . industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : so we can make it small if we have a l locating device . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : if we do a voice-activated locator , though , we 're gon na be looking at a more substantial chip . so user interface : so i that 's the other thing , it 's like you know are we gon na have certain chips that are gon na require bigger size period ? marketing : two double a_s , for this size . user interface : but like , you know , if we get more complicated then it 's gon na v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . marketing : right . industrial designer : honestly , i think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small , compact project manager : right . i agree , it 's either gon na be bigger with a base or smaller with just marketing : yeah . user interface : so we sh marketing : smaller , without project manager : a battery like this guy . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : mm yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? you wan na vote ? marketing : i think if we had a a locating device with the small one , i think that seems way more advanced . project manager : i 'm kind of i 'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i 'm a away from the base . project manager : bigger and the base . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : that just seems so clunky and industrial designer : 'kay so marketing : yeah , because i mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , user interface : smaller and smaller , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : yeah industrial designer : the only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash . user interface : you 're kidding . marketing : oh . project manager : industrial designer : you know it happens . user interface : industrial designer : i 've had three watches go that way too . marketing : yeah . project manager : user interface : oh watches i 've but i 've never washed a cell phone . marketing : ouch . a phone , whoa , that would wow , that would hurt . project manager : uh and what size batteries , double a_ , triple a_ ? marketing : i think triple a_ , it 'll be lighter . project manager : two ? could it run off of two marketing : i mean more more come in a package . user interface : well , that depends on what the energy is needed . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think , well , we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? so they 're more widely available now . and they also have a longer battery life than most batteries . project manager : they 're more expensive though , too . industrial designer : but if you only have to replace it every five years . project manager : mm . thoughts anybody ? marketing : that 's a good point . user interface : as long as we sell it with it . industrial designer : well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it , user interface : right , that 's what i meant . industrial designer : 'cause i 'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk . marketing : we could think about it and come back to it next meeting . project manager : okay . yeah . alright . industrial designer : yeah ."
