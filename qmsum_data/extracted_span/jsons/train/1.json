    "answer": "industrial designer : i 'm sorry to be late . project manager : welcome back everybody . user interface : yeah . thanks . project manager : so this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting . and uh opening and uh pms of the meet minutes , uh prototype presentation from uh christine and uh agnes . industrial designer : agnes , yes . project manager : yes and uh evaluation criteria . the finance , it 's uh from my side , from the management , and uh production evaluation . then uh closing . so we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so okay , let 's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype . user interface : mm , okay . project manager : so i handle to user interface : i 've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we 've both done , so if i 'm missing anything , christine can just correct me . project manager : so shall i go to sorry . industrial designer : uh thank you , so you did a powerpoint presentation , good for you . project manager : yep . s okay , let 's go to ami . user interface : it 's not the biggest powerpoint presentation in the world , but industrial designer : marketing : project manager : so in two or three or industrial designer : user interface : three . um . no it 's marketing : probably . technical pa i would think . user interface : think it 's the last one . no , then this is the la yeah , that one , final design . project manager : yeah . user interface : it is named appropriately , you just could n't see the name . industrial designer : marketing : user interface : um okay , can i have the mouse ? thanks . alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the tv on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we 've incorporated the lcd screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it 's too expensive , well then you just take it off . um , so to unveil our lovely product . this is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see . marketing : user interface : so if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow lcd display . um , this is actually hard to do . the yellow button you have is the on off button , so it 's really big , hard to miss . you have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . so up volume up , down volume down . the green are the channel changing . s and it 's one of those very light , very touchable displays . and then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the tv , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . so this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um and uh i could user interface : oh yes . industrial designer : yeah the d user interface : additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and i suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . so that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control . industrial designer : we have n't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . that depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um user interface : yeah . project manager : i think the microphone is on on the top , uh on the middle , the under the flip . industrial designer : yes , okay . uh-huh . project manager : so that will be the safe , so p any the chip it 's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to industrial designer : no , i mean it depends on the design of the circuit board . user interface : but it should n't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . project manager : uh it 's it 's yeah , but uh uh my opinion i think it 's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . but if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical i do n't think it 's uh feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . user interface : but if you 've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? i mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and i 'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , i can just use my voice . industrial designer : maybe i 've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and i 'm holding my cup of coca-cola in the other hand . user interface : yeah . and you do n't wan na let go of either one . marketing : i do n't wan na say . louder . yeah . user interface : i mean it does n't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . marketing : can also be on the side . project manager : yeah , the sides maybe is good . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so , i mean i can pass this around if anyone wants to project manager : yes . so it 's maybe good idea . industrial designer : yeah , y better you pass it around with a napkin . user interface : marketing : no , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would have n't been not be damaged or anything , and it 'd be accessible all the time to voice . user interface : yeah . project manager : yes . yeah . user interface : yeah , exactly . marketing : yeah . project manager : so it 's maybe good idea . s s industrial designer : it 's um it 's um marketing : compliments to the artist . industrial designer : you need to work on the weight a little bit . marketing : uh . project manager : okay . s i 'm fine , i 'm satisfi user interface : and maybe the shape of the buttons , project manager : i 'm satisfied . user interface : the little egg shapes are n't the most economical , but industrial designer : we 're glad you 're satisfied . project manager : of course it 's it 's it 's looks more heo heavy , but i think when it 's completely maybe it 's a less weight . user interface : yeah . i mean this is plasticene . there 's only so much you can do . we could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well . but and part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they do n't like something that 's too light , because they do n't feel like they have enough control over it . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so i mean maybe this is excessively heavy , but i think it needs to have some weight , it needs to feel like you 're still holding something . so that 's pretty much it for our presentation actually . project manager : that 's your uh prototype model ? user interface : yeah . project manager : okay , that 's good , thank you very much . marketing : project manager : so any comments or uh marketing : well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we 've we 've talked about on the previous meetings ."
