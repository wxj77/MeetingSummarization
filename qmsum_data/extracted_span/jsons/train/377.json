    "answer": "marketing : it 'd be like the ultimate remote . um okay . and th the last thing here was a , an lcd screen . so , i mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . not practical . um an lcd screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this powerpoint is working . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so that you do n't have so many buttons to deal with . project manager : um , i do n't know what an lcd screen is . marketing : oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . s or like um user interface : mobile phone . yeah . marketing : yeah . or like an alarm clock . you 'd have an lcd versus just a , a normal clock . industrial designer : what , what would appear on the screen ? project manager : i have no idea still . i 'm sorry . marketing : oh just like an electronic screen . as opposed to just buttons . there would be like a little , like on project manager : oh , on the remote . okay . marketing : yeah . like on the top of a cellphone , the the little lcd screen . project manager : yeah . marketing : um , now that 's , i , i dunno exactly what exactly we 'd put on there . i guess the channel that you 're on , the v the volume setting . user interface : yeah . could it it it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . but that would probably be industrial designer : like linked in with the teletext , user interface : yeah . that would be good , yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . user interface : yeah . might be quite expensive to do that though . industrial designer : mm , yeah . could be . user interface : marketing : well i guess that 's something we can all take back to our respective research . project manager : right . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . um , i think our priority really should be unique design . um , we want something that people want in their home . every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . so the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um , i th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . user interface : marketing : so if we 're , if we 're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product project manager : marketing : um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . i mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . but if we wan na make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend on a remote control . like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they 're just starting out marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and , yeah . marketing : right . and we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . i mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah i 'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that 's three months allowance . user interface : yeah . project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : um , so i i think , i think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . user interface : early twenties , that 's the kind of age group . project manager : yeah . and if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , user interface : twenties . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : i 'm sure that something like an lcd screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . industrial designer : yeah . complicated jus complicating things even fo mm . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : alright . industrial designer : okay ."
