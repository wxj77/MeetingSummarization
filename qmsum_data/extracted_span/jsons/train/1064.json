'cause i do n't . industrial designer : project manager : uh okay . so um . you okay over there ? reissa , marketing : i 'm fine . yeah . project manager : are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here marketing : i uh yeah , yeah . project manager : or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some internet shopping there ? user interface : think she 's finishing up her presentation . marketing : d i mean , i i 'm finishing off my presentation . industrial designer : marketing : no no . uh i 'm done . okay . project manager : okay , jolly good . alright , let 's have um well , we all know that it 's it 's a remote control that we 're gon na be dealing with . i think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . so that 's gon na be you catherine , industrial designer : okay . project manager : if we wan na hear from you first . industrial designer : okay . um just connecting this . project manager : you do n't have to worry about screwing it in just industrial designer : are we getting i really ? project manager : there you go . industrial designer : okay . cool . okay . so i 've got a very quick uh uh . okay . marketing : industrial designer : so the working design , i 've got a very quick presentation on this , so um i 've oh no , you ca n't see a thing . oh well , i 'm gon na draw it on the board then . it 's in blue uh , and i could n't change it . user interface : oh . industrial designer : we it 's fine on my screen , but never mind . so um the idea is that we 've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well okay , never mind . so um i think maybe uh two batteries , i dunno what they 're called six , or something like that . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh and then um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . and uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . so we 'll hear about that later from gabriel . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . um and that 's it really for the working design . project manager : great . okay . industrial designer : sorry the presentation was n't very uh clear but project manager : i prefer the pe i prefer the human touch personally . industrial designer : really ? cool . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : um , should i erase this or project manager : do you wan na just give us a moment , i just wan na copy this down . industrial designer : okay . project manager : um i dunno if you guys have got any questions for catherine on any of this ? industrial designer : fine . or suggestions ? marketing : is a battery like the only way of industrial designer : well , it 's just , you do n't want it plugged in really , s user interface : yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or project manager : yeah , you blow on it and i industrial designer : in indoors . marketing : no , no user interface : bicycle power . marketing : no i meant like industrial designer : marketing : no 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . industrial designer : marketing : the battery 's down and maybe , i dunno , solar charged ? industrial designer : i dunno , swi i th i th i think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but project manager : yeah , it 's worked for the last fifty years you know . marketing : mm . yeah . user interface : one question i have , and i do n't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the tv , and still have it be operational ? i mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . project manager : how far away is your television ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it 's never gon na be more than it 's never gon na be , you kno unless you 've got a tv the size of a football pitch , it 's not does n't have to go that far , user interface : uh industrial designer : well , the thing is uh you you do n't project manager : does it ? does n't have to go through a wall , because you 're not gon na be looking through a wall . user interface : that 's true . marketing : yeah , but if like you 're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you do n't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room . industrial designer : well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . i did n't think about that but marketing : how about bluetooth ? instead of using infra-red , use bluetooth . industrial designer : why not ? i just think that it 's it 's gon na cost more marketing : is n't that a better signal ? project manager : yeah , yeah i d it sounds like you you w do n't wan na overcomplicate things . industrial designer : and i 'm i 'm not sure it 's you 're gon na use it . marketing : mm . project manager : you know we do n't need it . industrial designer : it 's a fancy idea uh it 's quite nice , but then i do n't th i dunno , either you if you wan na watch the telly you 're in the room , project manager : yeah , exactly . industrial designer : you are gon na project manager : basically , we 're we 're desi we 're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . industrial designer : but project manager : we 're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . it 's uh industrial designer : oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i we can see at a later stage , maybe , i do n't marketing : 's just an idea . project manager : okay . right , well done , catherine . um gab gabriel let 's uh let 's hear from you on on on such things . user interface : okay . industrial designer : do you need the border ? user interface : uh i 'm just gon na use the powerpoint uh . industrial designer : okay . sorry . user interface : technical . okay . marketing : user interface : okay , so , while this is warming up , marketing : adjusting . user interface : there it is uh . marketing : yeah . user interface : so i 'm doing the user interface design . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , i was i was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . we do n't want to do something that 's too radical of a change , i guess , i mean people want a remote that 's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but project manager : mm yeah . user interface : um so we can improve what 's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . uh one thing that i did n't include here , that i forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . project manager : okay . user interface : uh , i do n't i dunno , uh that 's one possibility . and so in the research that i was doing there 's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which i do n't know if i can access the web page from here , but i can show you uh . yeah . so this is a engineer centred one , so you see it 's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : uh and this is a user centred one . uh it 's it 's easier to g just glance at this and see what 's possible to do , project manager : yeah . user interface : you 're not gon na be staring at it for five minutes . project manager : great . user interface : and i judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting i kind of gathered that that 's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . um . so , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , reissa , marketing : user interface : because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . project manager : yeah . marketing : . user interface : so uh , yeah , that 's me . project manager : great . okay . now that 's i just have a q a q question for you . this w um research that you 've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units stuff . um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or user interface : no that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as i know . i mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones . project manager : yeah . user interface : that was sort of the inspiration for it . um i 've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business . project manager : yeah . user interface : i 've , have n't i 've never seen a locking functionality . i dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that 's really necessary ? project manager : um i would say it 's if it 's simple to do , which i think it probably should be , user interface : yeah . project manager : even if it 's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , user interface : mm-hmm . 'kay . project manager : it 's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , user interface : right . project manager : but you know being physical . look into . um i 've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we 've got ta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . it 's got ta d look like it 's in the r_ and r_ . user interface : mm . project manager : you know , the the company it 's it 's , from what i can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . um . marketing : mm . user interface : right . and our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . project manager : we put the fashion in electronics . there you go . user interface : i think i think we have to carry that mental . project manager : so it 's kinda got ta look it 's got ta look new and s you know something fashionable . if if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be . user interface : well yeah these , i think , we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what i did n't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . project manager : yeah . because we need user interface : i t i think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , i mean . project manager : yeah . great . industrial designer : user interface : uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there 's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , i guess . um . project manager : okay , fantastic . marketing : okay . project manager : right , well done , gabriel . marketing : . project manager : um reissa . let 's plug you in , baby . marketing : where does it go into ? user interface : . marketing : here ? user interface : yeah . marketing : the blue thing . user interface : uh , yeah , this is getting all . marketing : user interface : mm . marketing : . user interface : yeah , then you just have to do function f_ eight and it should come up . marketing : well , function f_ eight . no project manager : yeah , w it it just takes a wee while . user interface : yeah , it just takes a second uh . marketing : oh . come on . right . okay . . okay . well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . so seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . okay , so they do n't like the look of the remote control . um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . so i think we all agree with that . um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . so , they do n't like like the way they operate it does n't like match how people behave . um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably do n't use those , they only use the up and down channel . project manager : 'cause we 've only got five channels . marketing : exactly . industrial designer : marketing : that 's another thing . um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like . project manager : i think that 's k flicking quickly between channels . user interface : yeah , you wan na navigate the channels quickly i guess . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : mm . um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . i think especially for uh the older generation . i know my grandmother does n't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . so maybe tracking devices is a good idea . project manager : wow . marketing : um personal preferences . project manager : you are a child of technology , are n't you ? marketing : um so yeah um i was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . um has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . and it 's easy to find , so i do n't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they 'd be interested in um voice activating . industrial designer : marketing : so voice activation . so and this was what we came up with . then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , sorry , age groups . so fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . project manager : so there you go , yeah . marketing : um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason did n't want a voice activated one . and neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . industrial designer : project manager : uh but do the younger generation have the money ? they they do n't . user interface : no i would i would say the older the older people , yeah . project manager : it 's older generation , they 're the ones that have gone out and marketing : well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so project manager : people people from the age of thirty f there 's a big drop off there . marketing : project manager : for people up to the age of thirty five , you 're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . um but no they 're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , user interface : yeah , that would be my guess as well . project manager : uh 'cause they 're the ones that have been working for twenty years . marketing : so they do n't project manager : um d and tha marketing : well project manager : and that 's a that 's quite a minority there , so yeah , it 's not even like fifty fifty that 's th thirty five per cent . marketing : these guys are growing up . user interface : what about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? i mean if if it 's twelve fifty per unit . project manager : yeah . user interface : i mean , okay , there 's marketing : voice activation might not be the best . project manager : i would say scra i 'd say scrap that straight off . marketing : um also with um with buttons , a thing called r_s_i_ , so wrist sense user interface : repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing marketing : yeah , repetitive strains injury , so they do n't i think people who watch tv maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . industrial designer : well maybe they should n't watch so much tv then . marketing : i do n't think so . project manager : so y so it 's so it 's so you got user interface : project manager : so that 's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of marketing : yeah maybe not so hard . project manager : see have a look if um there 's any w any medical background we can find out about this . industrial designer : maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a marketing : yeah . project manager : let 's jus marketing : maybe project manager : we just want need to cover our arses so that people are n't gon na sue us in ten years ' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . user interface : yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh . project manager : yeah . they 're having a lunch break at the moment , but yeah . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : i 'll see if i can get see if i can get hold of them for the next meeting . user interface : yeah . i think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . project manager : yeah . marketing : mm . maybe th the buttons not so high up so you do n't have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something . yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : so that is me . project manager : that 's great , thank you very much for that , reissa . um okay , so we 've basically we 've decide we 've d we 've decided that it 's gon na be , you know uh , we 're going for a basic television remote . it 's got ta be safe to use , it 's got ta look cool . it 's got ta be cheap . s um . now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or bluetooth . i think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . um . but a in there 's no i do n't think there 's any point in making a remote control unit that 's gon na last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we wo n't have televisions in ten years ' time . so i think we 're all um pretty sussed on that . um anyone have any questions ? everybody happy in their work ? user interface : yeah , it seems like we 're all on the pretty much on the same page . project manager : now this is good , we 've got a good structure going on . we all know where we 're going to . have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ? user interface : oh it 's probably just you , 'cause you 're the project manager . industrial designer : . project manager : marketing : well , just questionnaires . project manager : yeah . user interface : sell trying to sell your things . project manager : yeah , stuff . marketing : project manager : um okay . do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ? marketing : yeah , you can . project manager : right . do all you all know my e-mail address ? user interface : okay . no i do n't . i industrial designer : well , in the project announcement , you 've got the addresses , i think . marketing : i think he 's participant one , are n't you ? industrial designer : so project manager , it 's participant one at ami . user interface : uh oh , it 's just participant one oh okay . yeah . project manager : can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ? marketing : project manager : . industrial designer : you have them i you have them , user interface : well it 's just w it 's just it 's just par participant one , participant two . industrial designer : but we 'll send you an e-mail . project manager : send me , yeah industrial designer : you want to have friends , do n't you ? project manager : yeah , okay . user interface : so are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that 's our next meeting that we discuss that . project manager : is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? i i kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but i might be just going a bit user interface : well , it 's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . project manager : okay . user interface : maybe that 's like getting ahead of ourselves . project manager : well , maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas ? industrial designer : it would n't be marketing : ca n't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col project manager : well , see the thing is is we 've got ta keep the company image . marketing : like does it have to be of a certain ? project manager : it 's got ta say people have got ta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it 's a real reaction i product . marketing : but if it 's a r_r_ , it would be real reaction , project manager : there 's loads of companies that called r_r_ . marketing : like if it had a symbol on it . project manager : this is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . marketing : whoa . user interface : and this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , project manager : yeah . user interface : so , i mean , we are sort of beholden to them . marketing : so we have to have it one colour . project manager : well , not necessarily . but we have to incorporate it . user interface : not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . project manager : not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it 's one of our products industrial designer : well you could project manager : as opposed to a sony product or a , you know , a panasonic product . it 's got to so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . industrial designer : it could come but it could come in different colours and have the r_r_ colours just somewhere project manager : yeah . industrial designer : like just around the lock button could be the r_r_ logo or colours and project manager : yeah . industrial designer : if . project manager : quite poss yeah . well this is all your department . mm okay . well , well done everybody . user interface : . project manager : and um , i think we uh stop for lunch now . user interface : yeah , pretty soon i think , i guess that 's now . marketing : are we are we finished ahead of schedule ? project manager : we might possibly have done . industrial designer : cool . user interface : alright , see you all soon . project manager : if we 've if we 've finished at five minutes before the meeting 's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . marketing : 'kay uh ."
