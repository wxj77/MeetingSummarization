    "answer": "industrial designer : okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it 's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . we have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls . um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah , it feels uh good in your hand . marketing : industrial designer : mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . uh i 've got a uh email from the possibilities of real reaction . um uh they 're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . mm it 's okay . yeah . i when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . uh um the energy source , uh i 've got a lot of possibilities for that too . um , uh the basic battery , which i thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah , kinetic uh energy . also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and so you do n't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : um uh also the case material , uh i think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird . user interface : oh titanium is probably trendy , i think . . marketing : that 's true , i guess . yeah . user interface : well , maybe a little bit expensive . marketing : user interface : i do n't know . industrial designer : uh , they do n't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium . um the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . mm , i 've told about uh the three first points . mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the led transmitter uh transmitter . uh , it 's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . um , another possibility . i uh yeah , i looked up on was uh the lcd displays . could be uh something special to our uh remote control , and it 's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five euros . project manager : twelve and a half . actually industrial designer : ah yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , production cost . industrial designer : i th i got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one . user interface : industrial designer : you see uh a covers , which can be project manager : what are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so user interface : industrial designer : um , i do n't know . um marketing : project manager : but it 's actually kind of uh user interface : i project manager : well , it resembles the design i had in mind for this proj you know the the cartoonish alessi kind of design . industrial designer : yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh project manager : and we can we can steal their ideas . marketing : industrial designer : maybe a kind of uh whole uh um a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh with a huge variety of uh project manager : well , it 's a possibility , too . industrial designer : uh house uh stuff . user interface : different colours also . industrial designer : like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style , but project manager : uh-uh . marketing : yeah , that 'll be for the future , i guess . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah . project manager : next time we 're here . industrial designer : yes , because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it . marketing : yeah . project manager : oh , okay . marketing : yeah . definitely . project manager : okay . user interface : okay . industrial designer : thank you . marketing : alright . user interface : uh marketing : yeah . that 's okay ."
