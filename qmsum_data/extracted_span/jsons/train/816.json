    "answer": "mr. jagmeet singh ( burnaby south , ndp ) : thank you , mr.chair . the canadian armed forces report showed the relationship between equipment costs and the lack of care for our seniors . will the government admit today that there is no room for profit in the care of our seniors ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , that 's a very important question , and i would like to thank the member for asking it . i think this is a historic week . all canadians have seen what is happening in ontario and quebec . we the chair : order . we 'll go back to mr.singh . mr. jagmeet singh : mr . chair , experts and advocates have all pointed out that in the for-profit model of care for seniors , there is more emphasis on the bottom line than on care for seniors . will the liberal government admit that there is no place for profit when it comes to the care of our seniors ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , i want to start by saying one thing , and that is to publicly thank , in this house , brigadier-general conrad mialkowski and his team for compiling the assessment that they did of long-term care homes in ontario . they acted with courage . they acted with compassion . what they did is historic , and we all need to the chair : we 'll now go back to mr. singh . mr. jagmeet singh : the canadian forces , of course , always deserve our thanks . however , they do n't need our thanks right now ; they need to see some action on what they have pointed out . the government owns revera , the second-largest long-term care provider in canada . it 's for profit , and it 's facing a $ 50-million lawsuit for negligence . what is the government doing to protect seniors in the long-term care homes that they own ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr . chair , i agree with the member opposite that after what we have learned this week , all options must be on the table when it comes to how care for our elders will be provided in canada in the future . i think it is clear to us all that root-and-branch reform is necessary . we need to act with speed but not haste , and work with our provincial partners . mr. jagmeet singh : if all the options are on the table , will the liberal government commit to removing profit from long-term care , particularly in the revera long-term care homes , the second-largest number in canada , which the government owns ? will it commit to removing profit from long-term care ?"
