    "answer": "lynne neagle am : dawn has a question on transition . dawn bowden am : yes . thank you , chair . we 've heard , not necessarily just in the context of this report , because we 've heard similar evidence around transition arrangements in another committee report when we did the suicide prevention , and i 've in fact only recently\u2014well , just this week , actually\u2014met with community mental health teams in my constituency , and there is still some concern about transitional arrangements from children into adult services . now , i know we had the\u2014 . the transition guidance was published a couple of years ago now , and the programme was involved in developing that guidance . but what 's your assessment of the impact that it 's had ? because we clearly are still seeing people falling through the gaps , are n't we ? carol shillabeer : yes , thank you for that . you 're absolutely right ; we developed that guidance and we are currently in the process of the evaluation of that . and , in particular , i know that the children 's commissioner is very focused on transition , not just around children in receipt of emotional mental health support , but children in paediatric wards , and there is a working group with welsh government looking at this . the children 's commissioner has used our guidance to put that on the table to say , 'well , if this works , this needs to be considered as a model for using elsewhere ' . but the big question there is 'if ' . so , we do want to get evaluation . if i were just to give an estimate of where i think this will land , i think it will have made improvements , but there may well be some further work to do in enhancing , supporting , auditing that every child is supported in line with that guidance . so , i talked about community practice and clinical audit : is this something that we make , then , a mandatory audit , each year , that we do that double check ? because it 's one of those things where we know when a child is 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , so what 's stopping us ? if indeed the evaluation says it 's not happening everywhere , it 's not happening early enough , what is stopping us ? we really need to get underneath that . so , my sense will be it will show us , it will be better , but there 's some further work to do , and following that up in terms of audit and making sure that we 've got a systematic approach to dealing with those who have n't had the guidance fully implemented , because it can make a real difference . dawn bowden am : yes , and it seems to me\u2014you 've just talked about having a systematic approach , and it does seem to me that it is a systematic process , is n't it ? so , it should n't be difficult . i know we 're talking about in the health service things should n't be difficult and they are , and one of the gripes\u2014i had a meeting with the community health team\u2014was the problems of the new it systems and so on\u2014let 's not go there at the moment . but , really , this is just about referring children and having a smooth transition from the service being provided to them as a child and then just shifting it over to the adult services . it should n't be difficult . it 's really difficult to get my head around why that is such a problem and why that needs to be so difficult . carol shillabeer : can i add one other dimension in , which i think is going to be quite interesting ? we talk about transitions being an issue\u2014and we know it 's not just in mental health , but it 's elsewhere\u2014then you start to think , 'what if we could reduce transitions ? ' , so you reduce the number of transitions and you manage them better . we are doing a piece of work with government on the potential to explore what a 0-25-type service would be . we know that in different places they have approached that\u2014in australia and places in the uk . there are probably some pros and cons , but should we be moving to a 0-25 . that is moving the transition at the age of 25 , but at least it 's not at the eighteenth birthday . what 's the argument around what adolescent , young people and young adults services are , for example ? that piece of research and understanding\u2014 dawn bowden am : you could probably have a gradual transition , then , could n't you ? carol shillabeer : quite potentially . i 've got some people who have joined my own health board who 've worked in that 0-25-type service , and we 're catching up\u2014'tell me what was good about it ? tell me what was not so good about it ? what did the young people themselves think about that ? ' . because if we can manage down the numbers of transitions , there really should be no excuse not to get transitions right , then ."
