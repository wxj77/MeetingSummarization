    "answer": "hefin david am : good morning , minister . how has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas , and is it something of a mixed bag ? huw irranca-davies am : it 's gone well , but i 'm glad we 've done it through this process of early implementer , actually piloting it , because we 're learning lessons as we go along . it has gone well . it 's been encouraging , to the extent that we 're at the point where we 're expanding\u2014we 've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons . but , in terms of what we 're learning , one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we 're taking , because it 's being done on the seven early implementers . so , we 're asking parents to come in , provide their wage slips , provide the birth certificates , and so on . you 're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds , so it 's difficult . and the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area . in one case , it 's a whole authority , but it 's only one\u2014that 's in blaenau gwent . in others , it 's smaller areas . so , we 're also hitting those\u2014 . the other big challenge we 're hitting is communication . so , we 're having parents , generally , who are outside the areas entirely saying , 'why have n't we got this yet ? can we please get into it ? ' , which is encouraging . but the other thing we 're having is people who are within pilot authorities , where it does n't extend to the whole authority , saying , 'well , hold on now , we think we qualify for something under universal care , we think we qualify for something on tax credits . why do n't we qualify for this ? ' 'well , you 're not in the pilot area . ' so , we 're learning about these things , but the biggest one , i have to say , is the administrative burden , and i think that 's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out . hefin david am : what is the administrative burden ? what specifically is that ? huw irranca-davies am : it is that sheer burden on each local authority , and each pilot area , to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility , to bring in documents to prove their eligibility , to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are , what their salary slips say . it 's incredibly bureaucratic . so , yesterday , when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the childcare funding ( wales ) bill , we made clear that our preferred option , as put within that framework bill , is actually to build on , and to learn from the lessons as well , the model of the hm revenue and customs type of model , where you actually have\u2014and this , by the way , is supported by local authority providers out there\u2014one system that is a centralised system , where there is clarity , that is handled , that has elements of information sharing between government departments , such as the department for work and pensions , and so on , so that the work is done for the parents , and the work is done for the local authorities ; much cleaner , much simpler . hefin david am : how confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020 ? huw irranca-davies am : we are very confident . but , as i say , i 'm more confident in the fact that we 're actually piloting it , and phasing this in , because i think we 've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere , including just over the border in england , where they have a different version of a childcare offer , but they 've gone for it in a big-bang approach . and it has led to technical issues , it 's led to volume issues , where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it , and the complexity , i have to say , of individual family situations , whereas what we are doing , hefin , is taking this forward very , very carefully . each roll-out , each expansion that we 're doing of the pilot is not\u2014and i know this has caused some people to come back and say , 'why ca n't we all have it now ? ' it 's because we 're only rolling out to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it 's rurality or , as it will be within densely urban areas , where the cost might be slightly higher , and that 's allowing us to have the confidence that we 'll have it . we 've expanded the whole offer across gwynedd\u2014the whole of gwynedd , anglesey and caerphilly . flintshire now have a cross-authority offer . rhondda cynon taf is anticipating doing this by september . swansea is planning to do it , they tell us , in due course\u2014in short order\u2014as well . so , we have the confidence now that , with that learning going on from different pilot areas , we 'll have the full roll-out by 2020 . hefin david am : is it true to say that , in the early adopter areas , the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across ? huw irranca-davies am : absolutely . hefin david am : and why is that ? is that going to cause a problem across wales ?"
