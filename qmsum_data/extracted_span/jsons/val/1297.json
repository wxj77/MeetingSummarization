    "answer": "project manager : looking at what we 've got , we we want an lcd display with a spinning wheel . industrial designer : yeah . let 's let 's try to r rub off things and project manager : yeah , rub off some of those . industrial designer : yeah , so um user interface : industrial designer : hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? you you got a wind dynamo , yeah . project manager : yeah , user interface : yeah uh-hum yeah . project manager : it 's not that 's not streamlined and sexy , having a having a wind up . industrial designer : okay . um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , project manager : i think tha industrial designer : but uh it 's marketing : it 's about the practicality of it really , is n't it ? you know ? industrial designer : yeah . as against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , marketing : i mean if industrial designer : this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . project manager : depends how much how much movement it really needs . industrial designer : kinetic energy it needs i do n't have too much technical information on that , project manager : pr presumably if they 're suggesting it , then we could use it . industrial designer : yeah , right . okay , let 's keep it option uh keep an option , project manager : i 'd i 'd keep it on . industrial designer : yeah . um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? it has to be at least curved from one side , yeah . project manager : we do n't want that user interface : yeah project manager : it 's no it 's not not vegetable . user interface : it 's yeah . industrial designer : um okay , we still have all all the options . wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? project manager : user interface : n wood is i ca n't n how do you uh i mean you ca n't keep it really small uh you ca n't make it like thin and industrial designer : right . marketing : i ca n't imagine a m wooden remote control . user interface : the wood thing . because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so i mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky industrial designer : yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it 's likely to break , user interface : wi mm-mm yeah . industrial designer : it 's it 's much more uh user interface : yeah , yeah . project manager : yeah , and given that we 're we 're looking at more spongy material preferences , i ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more user interface : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : u yeah wood is not really yeah . industrial designer : right . marketing : well it 's not very cleanable either , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : do you know . user interface : yeah . marketing : it 's it 's not a practical i mean it 's it 's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and splinters and stuff and industrial designer : yeah , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay wood is out . marketing : it just m does n't make any sense , i think is the thing with wood . industrial designer : right . user interface : yeah , yeah , in the case of remote control not really . industrial designer : okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but uh it seems to be out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be marketing : you have to have some push-buttons , do n't you ? user interface : yeah , but you um i think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , would n't you ? project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm right . marketing : g yeah , yeah . user interface : yeah , so for channel numbers but industrial designer : oh , if if we have lcd displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an lcd display , then mm you can select almost everything on the lcd display . user interface : but i th yeah but i think the lcd display is kind of yeah , it 's faster project manager : just for fast user interface : with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then i mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , marketing : industrial designer : right . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . project manager : yeah . user interface : but if you do want to use lcd , then you flip it open , marketing : user interface : but it 's it it 's more time-consuming . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : i think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that i made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . industrial designer : mm right . project manager : and it user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah l_ lcd . industrial designer : so uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? or do we have just uh channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ? user interface : no , no , i mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers , industrial designer : the numbers . user interface : because it 's uh otherwise people do n't want to flip through all the channels . um marketing : yeah . industrial designer : right . marketing : yeah . project manager : do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as lcd ? industrial designer : or on the lcd we can , you know marketing : g yeah , user interface : yeah , i would say buttons , marketing : i would think buttons , yeah . project manager : buttons . user interface : because it 's yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : it 's it 's the industrial designer : so mm marketing : i think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their tv and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , project manager : mm . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their tv and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , industrial designer : alright . marketing : but , you know , i mean most of the time user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : i mean there 's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the tv , i think is the the the issue there . industrial designer : right . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay , so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um project manager : i think that 's what you guys are gon na do next , industrial designer : uh okay . project manager : so if we put down the key um things that we want . industrial designer : okay , okay , so the components . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ? user interface : yeah but n i i 'm not completely um completely clear uh i yeah , about the spinning wheel . so i think it it does n't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , marketing : e either or user interface : it 's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you marketing : g yeah . project manager : just spinning and not scrolling , i would say . user interface : yeah , yeah , marketing : i would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , user interface : in that case . project manager : yeah . marketing : so you have to decide whether you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . but i mean the the thing with this whole if y you 're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it 's spongy , then i 'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . industrial designer : mm um project manager : but if you 've got a if if you 've got a flipped thing , effectively it 's something that 's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . user interface : ah , but i mean you can marketing : yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . project manager : th that would be on one side , uh-huh . industrial designer : i 'm not sure it 'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . uh i it project manager : no , i think it 's just the casing rubber on the outside . user interface : yeah , i um i think so too , i mean the case would be marketing : you want an outside of rubber user interface : yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons , marketing : and then open it up and industrial designer : or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . project manager : yeah . user interface : rubber buttons , but then project manager : yeah . industrial designer : everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it . user interface : yeah . marketing : or maybe like interchangeable cases . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : 'cause i know like we 're going back to ipods again n the whole spinning wheel , but i have like a you know , obviously my ipod 's not made of rubber , but then i have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it industrial designer : right , right . marketing : and i can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit . industrial designer : right , project manager : user interface : industrial designer : okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . um marketing : yeah , i think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . industrial designer : right . yeah , and uh we 're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ? project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : that 's right , marketing : yeah . project manager : that 's what they 're after . industrial designer : so i 'll rub that out . and uh colours can be provided with the case rather than um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah i think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or marketing : that does n't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . project manager : i guess . user interface : yeah , does project manager : bananas . user interface : yeah . banana 's yellow , yeah , definitely . marketing : yeah , but i mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? so you could have like project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : i mean i suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple project manager : green . yeah . marketing : and that and then you 'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it . industrial designer : okay . um okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . uh since we 're having lcds there there 's no way that we 're will be able to project manager : we need the advanced yeah . industrial designer : um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since lcds seems to be uh a definite yes , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so i 'll rub off the other two . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so are we discounting solar energy because rubber 's gon na be used in there somewhere or project manager : that was the industrial designer : oh is oh the constraint was uh marketing : if project manager : we ca n't have solar panels with rubber , so . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : solar panels with the rubber . industrial designer : yeah . so marketing : yeah , okay , so we lose that i think . project manager : shall we go for if we 're going for rubber , we think uh on as our case , and then user interface : mm-hmm . and the buttons as well , i think . yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i think uh project manager : we 've got five more minutes . industrial designer : we 'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , i mean , a although it does seem uh interesting . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but it does not hold any advantages as such for a marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : it 's just a gimmick . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay . uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? it it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so project manager : mm-hmm . yeah . i think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then i 'd put them in , industrial designer : ye yeah , we we do n't have too much information about it , um project manager : but if it 's yeah . user interface : yeah , but it it i think it should be quite cheap because it 's from our own company , yeah . project manager : it 's from the company , so industrial designer : yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : right . project manager : okay . and the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it 's flipped into each other . industrial designer : flat on the top . yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay . project manager : can i pull the thing out the back of your computer ? marketing : yeah , sure j project manager : just so we can marketing : sorry , do you want me to project manager : nothing , it 's right , i 'm just there we go . marketing : what does um i_c_s_ mean ? industrial designer : i_c_s ? uh integrated circuits . marketing : okay , cool . so it 's advanced integrated circuits ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : uh oh now i 've gone too far . industrial designer : uh um we we 're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as lcds , mm . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . we 're on our way . okay . so we 've basically worked out that we 're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip industrial designer : right . project manager : and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber . we 're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an lcd with spinning wheel , and we 're incorporating voice recognition . that 's our overall concept , user interface : um project manager : and it 's gon na look sort of vegetable , marketing : user interface : industrial designer : project manager : and be in bright vegetable colours . user interface : uh-huh . so w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the lcd , or would it be on the outer marketing : imagine it would be inside . project manager : i think it 's on the user interface : okay . marketing : so um actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you 've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you 've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . user interface : mm-hmm . yeah , okay . marketing : um so you 've still not got like a lot of stuff in the project manager : mm-mm . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . marketing : you 've maybe got , you know like if you 're modelling on ipod you 've got five buttons and a wheel , project manager : on the mm-hmm . marketing : and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one 's the little bit inside the wheel , project manager : in the centre , marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , sure . user interface : mm yeah . project manager : okay , so now we 've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . in the meantime , the industrial designer over here is gon na work on the look and feel design , industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : which i 'll presume he 'll work out what that means . um the user interface designer will work on the user interface design and the marketing expert is going to work on product evaluation . and as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we 've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . industrial designer : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : cool . project manager : is that all okay ? and anyone who has n't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , okay . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : cool , i 'm gon na go and sit on my own . project manager : y ah nobody wants to talk to you . marketing : i know , i 'm hated . project manager : unplug yourself . industrial designer : user interface : hmm . marketing : i 've got a bit tangled up in all this user interface : so but shall i move away first or shall i stay here with project manager : i dunno , maybe i would car"
