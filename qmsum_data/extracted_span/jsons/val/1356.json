    "answer": "user interface : not at this point . project manager : there we go . okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . we 've got um we 're planning to sell these remote controls for let 's make that go away , that means we 've got five minutes . um we 're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each . um and with that we 're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros . and that 's selling them on the international market , not just in the u_k_ . um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half euro so that we can reach that profit target . so that 's something to keep in mind while you 're designing . okay . hmm . this is let me just skip ahead to see that 's the last thing , okay . we 've only got a couple of minutes . does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we 're thinking of this remote control ? user interface : yep . i 'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . project manager : mm-hmm . i think that 's probably something that w it 's best if we take away with us , industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer : i think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um i think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . project manager : something something new . marketing : yeah , i was looking at the website , and the other things that they 've made and i like put down some like inspirational words like that i got from looking at the pictures . so the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and um so it 's something that is sleek and stylish but it 's still functional , you know ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so i 'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they do n't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . industrial designer : alright . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : you know , so something heading towards that , so it 's not overly i mean i do n't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so i figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . project manager : so perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer : marketing : something that 's a little less crowded than this , like i mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your tv , right ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but what do most people do ? project manager : yeah . marketing : they turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : there is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing : sometimes they play a movie . industrial designer : but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah . marketing : yeah , so project manager : yeah . marketing : there 's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager : so , no . marketing : maybe to do project manager : it could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and then use the user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so , if you 're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that 's fine project manager : marketing : and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . project manager : mm-hmm . excellent . marketing : 'cause like if you look at the train , it 's just very like , there 's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and i dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager : oh i have n't had a look yet , yep . marketing : um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too . project manager : mm-hmm . great . any other immediate thoughts before we move along ? industrial designer : mm . uh we can aim for i mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although i do n't think that um it 's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . um project manager : yeah ."
