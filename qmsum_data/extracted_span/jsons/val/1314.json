    "query": "<s> what did the group discuss about the trend of teacher recruiting and the reasons for it , and steps they had taken ?",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : thank you , suzy . i think , for this year 's intake , although we 're in touch with our providers , we 're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year 's intake for a couple of months . but what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets . so , there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs . so , what we 're doing is first of all making sure that our ite provision is world class , so that , actually , welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher . you 'll be aware that we 've recently been through an accreditation process for new ite provision that will start in the next academic year . we have looked at financial incentives . it 's not the whole answer , i think , to these issues , but it 's part of a mixture of things that we need to do . you 'll be aware that , for priority subjects , with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications , those financial incentives are now \u00a320,000 a year . we 're also embarking on our first ever national ite recruitment marketing exercise . we have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees , e-mailing them , sending them materials to ask them to consider ( 1 ) becoming a teacher , and ( 2 ) crucially coming to do that training here in wales . we are now part of a full national programme of ite recruitment , giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher . so , there 's a whole package of things we need to do . in january of this year i set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff , and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next . suzy davies am : thank you for that answer . i can see there 's a lot of activity , but what exactly is it responding to ? presumably , some research has been done about why people do n't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers . i ca n't believe it 's just about ite , although this is very valuable , what you 're talking about . is there something that 's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching is n't a profession they want to go into ? is that something that 's happening just in wales or is it happening elsewhere as well ? kirsty williams am : no . i think what you will find is that this is n't a uniquely welsh issue . i think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border , which proves to me that money is n't necessarily the entire answer , because , despite higher financial incentives to join ite courses , they 're not able to do that in england either . so , that proves to me\u2014what the research does show\u2014that it 's not money alone that will get people onto these courses . interestingly , i do n't even think it 's a uk problem . recently , as you 'll be aware via my written statement , i attended the atlantic rim collaboratory , which is a system-to-system conference . if you talk to education systems in different parts of the world , the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention . in the usa , they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers . so , in the californian system , significant teacher shortages , and in oregon , washington . i met with new york state\u2014significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in new york state , and in finland , australia . so , this is a common issue across the globe , really . that 's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of professor john gardner\u2014it 's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off . one of the things that we have got strong performance in , and i think this is perhaps something that we 're trying to follow up on , are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status\u2014so , those are people who are training on the job . those remain strong . there 's high demand for those places , so much so that we 've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year , which says to me that\u2014there 's definitely a place for the traditional , 'take a year off , do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'\u2014actually , that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching , which is why , of course , from next year , we will have our unique part-time pgce route into qualification . so , that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities , so they can earn while they learn , or maybe they 've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course . i think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools . so , there 's no one thing , i think , that we can do that will solve this issue . but it is an international issue , i agree with that . suzy davies am : okay . well , that 's what i was after finding out , and , actually , what you 've just said about the part-time pgce is pretty interesting as well , because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching , that 's got to help , has n't it ? kirsty williams am : can i just agree with you ? i think that is really , really important\u2014that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce . i think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really , really valuable . i was up in the deeside sixth just last week , talking to the a-level chemistry teacher . she had been a teacher for a while , she 'd gone into industry , worked in industry , and now had come back into teaching . she said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue . i 'm very keen to increase the diversity in our teaching workforce and i 'm very keen in looking at career changers , who perhaps have different life experience and work experience , coming into our teaching profession . suzy davies am : thank you for that . part of that diversity , of course\u2014it would be great if you had more people interested in qualifying to teach through the medium of welsh . great aspirations ; the trend 's going the other way . no-one can solve this in 280 characters , i get that , but can you give us some indication about why you think this is proving still such an unattractive option when it 's clear that there 's a policy for this country to improve the number of welsh speakers ? you 'd have thought there 'd be a pretty good carrot for this . kirsty williams am : sure . again , data for recruitment for the 2018-19 cohort is not yet available and we are , as i said , keeping in touch with our ite centres to keep a close eye on them . i think an important thing to recognise is that there is a difference between the number of people who are on courses where there is a specific designation that enables them to teach through the medium of welsh and those people who have linguistic ability and welsh ability but do n't necessarily do a course that allows them . so , there is a difference . we do think that , for the 2016-17 cohort , there were an additional 130 qualifiers that , actually , were fluent in welsh and who could have gone on to teach in welsh-medium schools , did n't necessarily do a course that gave them that designation . but , clearly , we 've got three academic years now to get to the targets that we 've set ourselves . the evaluation of welsh-medium provision in ite reported at the end of last month , and the minister and officials are busy working now to implement the recommendations of the report that was published , i think , on 28 september , to be able to move this agenda forward . again , we 've got new incentives , this year , both for people starting their course and then for teachers who complete their qts after a year . so , we 've added in new financial incentives this year to try and address some of those issues . but , clearly , these are ambitious targets and we will need to have a step change over the next three years if we 're to meet them . suzy davies am : thank you for that , cabinet secretary . thank you for that answer . we 're now talking about cohorts of students coming into pgce and teaching degrees . if they 're from wales , they will have had welsh as part of their education from day one , and we 'll accept there are varying qualities in different parts of wales , different attitudes towards it as well . but there is n't a single a person now who 's been through welsh education who can say they have no welsh at all , unless they 've moved into the system from , say , england very , very recently . what is being done within the teaching qualifications , including the degrees , to ensure that , at least in welsh universities , those nascent welsh language skills are at least kept alive , even though we 're not talking necessarily about being at a level where people can teach through the medium ? it's the age-old question : once the school gate closes , is that the end of their welsh use ? so , is there something\u2014it wo n't be donaldson , but in the teacher training qualifications\u2014that is keeping this going and , hopefully , increasing the usability of the welsh skills they have ? kirsty williams am : well , in terms of how we can encourage children who have got welsh skills as a result of their education up to 16 , how they can continue to use those skills and , potentially , use them in the workplace , i 'm sure eluned will want to talk about some of the work , for instance , in other , non-teaching sectors . but , with regard to ite , you 'll be aware that , in the evaluation report , as i said , that was published , the report comes forward with two options in how we could develop an intervention programme to support welsh language skills amongst all primary and secondary ite entrants . so , what we 'll be doing now as a result of that report is that we 'll be working very closely with our ite centres to develop and agree upon minimum provision that constitutes those skill levels within ite provision for all teachers . suzy davies am : thank you . llyr gruffydd am : you have your targets for 2021 , in terms of numbers of teachers coming through the system , which is positive , although , clearly , the report or the review itself said that , actually , we need to double the numbers , really . but it 's not just the trends that are going down ; it 's a cataclysmic drop , really . we 've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are going into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of welsh . so , it 's a huge turnaround that we 're looking for , and i 'm not getting the feeling that the level of ambition and the answers that you 're giving here this morning reflect the level of action that's needed , really . kirsty williams am : well , first of all , as i tried to illustrate to suzy , the figures on their own tell one story , but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak welsh and to be able to use\u2014 llyr gruffydd am : i think it's 40 per cent of those who are currently in the system who don't\u2014 kirsty williams am : \u2014the language and skills . and if we look at qualifiers of ite courses in wales by degree type , actually , we see a different trend\u2014we see numbers going up . so , there are statistics and there are statistics . depending on which ones you look at , it 's quite a complex picture . and that 's why we had the evaluation report . we understand and we know and acknowledge that there is more work to be done . that 's why we have got the evaluation of provision in ite and that 's why we 'll be taking that ambition forward . we know what we need to do . as i said , we 're not sitting back and hoping that something miraculous will change things . we are pulling levers and putting in place plans to improve that situation . llyr gruffydd am : thank you for that . clearly , there are statistics and there are statistics , so could you just explain to us which statistics you 've used for your targets for growth over the next three years ? kirsty williams am : well , that comes as a result of the work done for the 2050\u2014 llyr gruffydd am : upon which baseline are you basing the increases that you 're projecting ? kirsty williams am : we 're using the baseline of 2012-13 . there has been a decline since then . llyr gruffydd am : that 's the one i was using when i said '24 per cent reduction ' . kirsty williams am : there has been a decline in those numbers . that 's why , as i said , we 're doing the work that we need to do to reverse that decline . in using those numbers , we also know that there are additional people in the system who are not captured in those figures and who do have the linguistic ability to use their language positively in school settings . so , what i 'm saying is that that does n't tell us the whole story , but i will be the first to admit that there is a significant job of work with our ite providers to ensure that we will have the skilled professionals that we need to deliver on our ambitions , and i 'm not hiding from that . eluned morgan am : also , i just think it 's worth saying that a lot of this is about building the confidence of those people who actually can speak welsh , who are not teaching through the medium of welsh , and to give them that support . first of all , we need to identify who these people are , so there is a job of work being undertaken now in terms of registration in particular\u2014when people register , let 's just make sure that we collect that kind of data . kirsty williams am : we do n't even do that consistently at the moment . one of the recommendations of the report is that there is no consistent approach to understanding this baseline data and there 's no consistent competency test that people start at the beginning of their course , so we need a national approach rather than leaving it to individual institutions . llyr gruffydd am : have we missed any tricks , potentially , in terms of the reforms to accrediting ite , for example , in terms of , maybe , strengthening aspects around the welsh language and provision in that respect ? kirsty williams am : no , i do n't believe so . the accreditation process , which is independent of the government\u2014the accreditation process demands of our ite providers that their provision will be able to meet the goals of our curriculum . our curriculum is very clear about the equality of the language and the ability of our children , through all stages of their education journey , to be able to be bilingual children . llyr gruffydd am : so , that requirement , as far you 're concerned , is there . yes , okay . diolch\u2014thank you . lynne neagle am : before i turn to hefin , can i just clarify\u2014 ? in answer to suzy davies , you said that 65 per cent of the places in welsh training centres had been filled . is that 65 per cent of the priority places ? kirsty williams am : priority places . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you very much . kirsty williams am : sixty-five per cent of the priority courses are being met ."
