    "answer": "phd c : mm - hmm . i do n't see why why your signal is louder after processing , because yo grad e : yeah . i do n't know why - y , uh , either . phd c : yeah . professor b : i do n't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect . phd c : mm - hmm . grad e : oh , ok . professor b : yeah . i mean , i think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio . phd c : well , well professor b : so if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : but just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio grad e : it w i i it would n't affect things . phd c : yeah . well , the system is use the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on on the signal level . but , not so much , i guess . professor b : well , yeah . but it 's trained and tested on the same thing . so if the if the if you change in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect . phd c : mm - hmm . yeah ."
