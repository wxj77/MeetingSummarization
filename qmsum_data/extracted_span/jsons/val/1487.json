    "answer": "professor b : uh , the , uh , torrent chip . yeah . we were two we were phd c : yeah . professor b : uh , uh , we went through it jim and i went through old emails at one point and and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're we 're two months away from being done . it was very very believable schedules , too . i mean , we went through and with the schedules and we phd a : it was true for two years . professor b : yeah . oh , yeah . it was very true . phd a : so , should we just do the same kind of deal where we go around and do , uh , status report kind of things ? ok . and i guess when sunil gets here he can do his last or something . so . professor b : yeah . so we probably should wait for him to come before we do his . phd c : mm - hmm . phd a : ok . that 's a good idea . professor b : yeah . yeah . phd a : any objection ? do y ok , m professor b : all in favor phd a : do you want to start , morgan ? do you have anything , or ? professor b : uh , i do n't do anything . i no , i mean , i i 'm involved in discussions with with people about what they 're doing , but i think they 're since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves . grad f : ok . so should i go so that , uh , phd a : yeah . why do n't you go ahead , barry ? grad f : you 're gon na talk about aurora stuff , per se ? ok . um . well , this past week i 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal . so , um mmm . i just finished a section on , uh on talking about these intermediate categories that i want to classify , um , as a as a middle step . and , um , i hope to hope to get this , um a full rough draft done by , uh , monday so i can give it to morgan . phd a : when is your , uh , meeting ? grad f : um , my meeting phd a : yeah . grad f : with , uh ? oh , oh , you mean the the quals . phd a : the quals . yeah . grad f : uh , the quals are happening in july twenty - fifth . phd a : oh . soon . grad f : yeah . phd a : uh - huh . grad f : d - day . phd a : yeah . grad f : uh - huh . phd a : so , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and ? grad f : right , right . so , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . and , um , and then , um then everybody asks you questions . yeah . phd a : i remember now . grad f : yep . so , um . phd a : have you d ? i was just gon na ask , do you want to say any a little bit about it , or ? mmm . grad f : oh . uh , a little bit about ? phd a : wh - what you 're what you 're gon na you said you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at , grad f : oh , the the phd a : or grad f : right . well , i was , um , i think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while i was thinking that i had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away . but what i 'm thinking now is , i would start with with a reasonable set . something something like , um , um like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to just to start off that way . and do some phone recognition . um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . look at then i would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , ok , well , i could probably reduce the errors if i included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . that would that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . and then and then reiterate . um , build the intermediate classifiers . uh , do phoneme recognition . look at the errors . and then postulate new or remove , um , intermediate categories . and then do it again ."
