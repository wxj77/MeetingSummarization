    "answer": "grad e : how exactly does the data collection work ? do they have a map , and then you give them a scenario of some sort ? grad b : ok . imagine you 're the the subject . you 're gon na be in here , and somebody and and you see , uh , either th the three - d model , or uh , a quicktime animation of standing u in a square in heidelberg . so you actually see that . um . the uh , um , first thing is you have to read a text about heidelberg . so , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding german street names , like fischergasse and so forth . so that 's part one . part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know , and it understands you completely . and so you 're gon na pick up that phone , dial a number , and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve . first you have to know find out how to get to that place , maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there . maybe so , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild . the third one is to get information on the history of an object . the fourth one and then the g system breaks down . it crashes , and grad d : a at the third ? right then ? grad b : after the third task . and then or after the fourth . some find @ @ { comment } forget that for now . and then , a human operator comes on , and and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? now with a human operator . and so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects , and you go through it again , and that was it . oh , and one one little bit w and uh , the computer you are you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via gps . when the human operator comes on , um , that person does not know . so the gps is crashed as well . so the person first has to ask you `` where are you ? `` . and so you have to do some s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there . um , this is a a a a a bit that i d i do n't think we did we discuss that bit ? uh , i just sort of squeezed that in now . but it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people i know . so . grad d : so , in the display you can oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the grad b : yeah . a additionally , y you have a a a sort of a map type display . yeah ? i mean that would be an an an enormous technical effort , unless we would we can show it walks to , you know . we can have movies of walking , you walking through through heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there . grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : maybe we wan na do that . yeah . grad d : uh , i was just trying to figure out how how ambitious the system is . grad b : the map was sort of intended to you want to go to that place . you know , and it 's sort of there . grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : and you see the label of the name so we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that . grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . so your tasks do n't require you to i mean , uh yo you 're told so when your task is , i do n't know , `` go buy stamps `` or something like that ? so , do you have to respond ? or does your uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? like , w what you 're doing now ? or grad b : well , we 'll see what people do . grad d : there 's no ok , so it 's just like , `` let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances `` . grad b : yeah , and and we will record both sides . i mean , we will record the wi - the wizard grad d : uh - huh . grad b : i mean , in both cases it 's gon na be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case . grad d : uh - huh . grad b : and we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ? so , you first have to do this , and that , and and grad d : mm - hmm ."
