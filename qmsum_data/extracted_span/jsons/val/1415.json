    "query": "<s> what did the group talk about the evaluations on the increasing suicide crimes during the covid-19 and the long-term special care for the pregnant women ?",
    "answer": "vaughan gething am : i , personally , have n't read that advice , but the government 's already concerned about the direct physical and mental health impact of lockdown restrictions . you do n't need to be a parent to recognise that that \u2019 s a potential issue for children and young people . but , i 'm sure\u2014 . i have n't read it , but that 's been signposted , so i can check with officials if they have and if that would change the advice and the position that we 're already adopting , because we do regularly look at a range of advice from a range of sources , including the un , the world health organization and others . suzy davies am : thank you . lynne neagle am : okay , and we are going to come onto children 's rights . but , as you know , minister , the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart . can i ask what assessment the welsh government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic ? vaughan gething am : apart from the general concern that i 've expressed on mental health generally , we are already investigating , we 're having a\u2014 . we 've commissioned , through the government , the delivery unit to work with the national advisory group , including dr ann john and other people , to review the current , unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in wales , because we want to try to understand the wider concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people , and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not . so , that 's why we 've commissioned that review to be carried out with the current numbers of unexpected deaths that we have , so we 're able then to provide a report to understand where we are . my understanding is that we should have a report on that review before the end of this month and , obviously , i know the committee \u2019 s got an interest , so if it 's helpful we can write to you once we 've had a chance to receive the report and to look at it . lynne neagle am : yes , please . thank you . in terms of provision of crisis care , then , how has that been impacted by the pandemic ? are those crisis services available for children and young people who need them at the moment ? vaughan gething am : yes , they continue to be available . we still have seven-day-a-week crisis care . we 've made clear that mental health services , including those for children and young people , are essential services to be provided . they 're not services to be scaled down . they were not part of the series of measures that i stopped within the health service on 13 march . we have built up those crisis care services over a period of time , and the last thing we want to see is to see them disappear during this period of time when there are well-understood concerns about emotional and mental health . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . moving on to perinatal mental health , this morning i hosted a round-table with the nspcc where we heard about lots of good practice that 's going on in terms of supporting new mothers and their families in this period , but i wonder if you can tell the committee what you are doing as a government to make sure that there is consistent perinatal support for all women across wales in what is a difficult time for any new mother , let alone in a pandemic . vaughan gething am : we continue , again , to provide our perinatal mental health service . that 's not been stopped either . we 've also been looking at how that 's provided on a phone or online basis where possible , because again the same concerns exist about physical contact with people . so , we 're looking to make sure that the progress is n't lost that we 've made . we know there is more to go . so , the service may have changed , but it still absolutely exists . and again , part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that i 've previously committed to . so , i want to understand what that really means , but again the problem is , at this point in the pandemic , i ca n't give you an answer about what that means for that in-patient provision . we 're still committed to it , but i 'm concerned about the time frame\u2014that is partly about the length and the extent . but again , i 'm really impressed by the continuing commitment of our staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time . it 's difficult enough in terms of the challenge in terms of perinatal mental health in normal times , about people being prepared to come forward and then receiving the sort of response they 'd want , and even more so now . lynne neagle am : is the welsh government aware that there 's apparently been a decrease in the numbers of women being willing to look at mother and baby unit provision , and will you be taking that into account in your planning ? because , obviously , we would n't want people to think that was because of a lack of need ; it 's down to fear and the lockdown . vaughan gething am : yes , we 're aware there 's been a reduction in people wanting to make use of the service\u2014or being prepared to make use of the service is probably a better phrase\u2014because we know that 's the same with a range of other areas . there are n't fewer people having strokes than there were at this period of time last year ; the reason why the figures are different is the way that people are behaving because of their concerns about coronavirus . so , i certainly would n't be using this period of time to plan for the need that exists for a facility that we want to create . so , i 'm happy to give that assurance , chair ."
