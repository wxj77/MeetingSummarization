    "answer": "professor e : and and the i mean , the other side to it was the what which is where we were coming from i 'll i 'll talk to you more about it later { comment } is that is that there 's there 's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and and permissions and all that . i mean , they already do what they do do whatever they do . so it 's uh , it 's so it 's so it 's another source . so i think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at uw also and um and maybe we have this other source . but yeah i think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . i mean , that was sort of our goal . the thing was , i was hoping that we could @ @ in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . and at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that i think this semester . and if we continue to collect some next semester , i think we should , uh phd c : right . yeah i was mostly trying to think , `` ok , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with . and you you wan na s you wan na sort of fr freeze your your data for awhile so um right now and we do n't have the transcripts back yet from ibm right ? do oh , do we now ? professor e : well , we do n't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was phd c : so um , not complaining , i was just trying to think , you know , what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now professor e : yeah . phd c : and they 're pretty different , because professor e : yeah . so i was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like , grad g : right . phd c : um right . right , right . professor e : and and and uh and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can you can do a lot of other things . phd c : cuz i 'm not actually sure , just logistically that i can spend you know , i do n't wan na charge the time that i have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time . and that 's and especially with the student grad g : right . phd c : uh for instance this guy who seems professor e : yeah . phd c : uh anyway , i should n't say too much , but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will i have to work with , with that person . and so it 's professor e : i yeah , so i would think , exploratory things now . uh , three months from now um , i mean the transcriptions i think are a bit of an unknown cuz we have n't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , but i think as far as the collection , it does n't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in january , you know , ro roughly uh which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours . phd c : and we just do n't know about the transcription part of that , professor e : so that 's postdoc b : yeah , we need to i think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards , phd c : so . i mean , it postdoc b : and uh es especially since these people wo n't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions . phd c : right ."
