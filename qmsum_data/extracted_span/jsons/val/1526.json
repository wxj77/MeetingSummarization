    "query": "<s> what was the debate about government giving money to companies which did not put the amount into proper use ?",
    "answer": "the chair : mr.therrien , you now have the floor . mr. alain therrien ( la prairie , bq ) : mr.chair , during the pandemic , the government has given money to companies that do n't pay a cent in tax because they use tax havens . we told the government that it did n't make sense . the government 's response was that it is no big deal . during the pandemic , the government gave money to air canada , but air canada never reimbursed customers who did not get the services they paid for . we told the government that it did not make sense . the government 's response was that it was no big deal . during the pandemic , the liberal party used the emergency wage subsidy to fund partisan activities . we told them that it did not make sense . the government responded that it was no big deal . is the moral of the story that the government thinks that dipping into the pockets of taxpayers to spend money carelessly is no big deal ? hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , the fight against tax evasion is a priority for our government . we will continue to target companies that use tax evasion schemes . let me be clear : in everything we do , we will target companies and not innocent workers . employees are employees , no matter who they work for . mr. alain therrien : mr.chair , when i see that it 's the minister of national revenue answering me , i do n't feel like buying a lottery ticket . the liberal party used two airplanes in its last election campaign , which seems to indicate that it is n't short of money . however , the liberals used the emergency wage subsidy . why ? is it because they want taxpayers to fund a third airplane ? hon . bill morneau : mr.chair , we think it 's very important to protect employees across the country and in every economic sector that 's experiencing a significant drop in income . that 's the approach we 've taken to protect people and to ensure that there will be jobs in the future . we will continue this approach . mr. alain therrien : it 's especially important to protect the employees who work for the liberals to ensure their re-election , yet the liberal party has raised more than $ 7million since the last election . is the party in jeopardy ? can it go bankrupt ? hon . bill morneau : mr.chair , as i said , our approach is to protect employees . we think that this principle is very important and that this approach must be maintained in order to have a better job market in the future . mr. alain therrien : mr.chair , we still do n't know exactly how much money the liberals took from the cookie jar . we think they may have taken as much as $ 1million . how many smes could have been saved with the $ 1million that the liberals took out of the jar and took away from smes ? hon . bill morneau : mr.chair , we appreciate the question . we are protecting hundreds of thousands of smes through the emergency wage subsidy , the canada emergency response benefit and all our programs . we will continue this approach to help smes and their employees . mr. alain therrien : mr.chair , i will propose a choice of answers , or i wo n't get any . when did the government decide to use the emergency wage subsidy ? now here are three possible answers . the first possible answer is that when the liberals brought in the emergency wage subsidy , they set parameters allowing them to use it . the second is that when the liberals saw the conservative partywhich is as rich as they are , but also sanctimonious and self-righteoustake advantage of the subsidy , they thought they could do it too . the third possible answer is that the liberals had n't planned to use the subsidy , but they pounced on the cookie jar when they saw it , because that 's what they do . hon . bill morneau : mr.chair , we continue to think it is very important to protect employees in every sector of the economy and across canada . that 's our approach , and i believe it 's the right one to protect and preserve jobs across the country during a pandemic . the chair : we are now going to suspend the proceedings for a few seconds to allow the employees who provide support for the meeting to replace each other safely ."
