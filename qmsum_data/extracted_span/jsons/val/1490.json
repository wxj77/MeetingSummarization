    "answer": "grad e : oh . ok , sure . so , um , last week i finally got results from the sri system about this mean subtraction approach . and , um , we we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the ti - digits data set and testing on meeting recorder digits of , um , six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n on the far - mike data using pzm f , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent . and , um , wh why would that be , um , considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using htk ? and so , uh , with some input from , uh , andreas , i have a theory in two parts . um , first of all htk sorry , sr - the sri system is doing channel adaptation , and so htk was n't . um , so this , um this mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization and so that might have given the htk use of it a boost that would n't have been applied in the sri case . and also , um , the andreas pointed out the sri system is using more parameters . it 's got finer - grained acoustic models . so those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio . um . and me and barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . and so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone , um , depending on the timing of the echo . so , um , i 'm gon na try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . so i 'm planning to use the macrophone set of , um , read speech , and , um hmm . professor b : i had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that some of the other stuff that avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy sections ? um , uh , if you if you did a high - pass filtering , as hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , avendano and hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you got ta figure out what to do with them if you 're gon na continue treating this as a power spectrum . so , what what hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero set the negative values to zero . so if you imagine a a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . and it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . you know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in so in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing . i mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n and , um , what if you did ? i mean , there 's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . i mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer . grad e : uh - huh . professor b : and one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of vad - like thing grad e : mm - hmm . professor b : and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some , uh , very low or or near zero value . i mean , uh , i 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh grad e : uh - huh . professor b : or pre - echoes , whichever they are are are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them . grad e : uh - huh . professor b : be pretty simple . i mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech . phd g : um , what is the reverberation time like there ? grad e : in thi in this room ? uh phd g : on , uh , the the one what the s in the speech that you are you are using like ? grad e : y yeah . i i i i do n't know . professor b : so , it 's this room . phd g : it 's , uh professor b : it 's it 's this room . phd g : oh , this room ? professor b : so so it 's these are just microphone this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on . uh , we should do a measurement in here . i g think we never have . i think it 's i would guess , uh , point seven , point eight seconds f uh , r t something like that ? but it 's you know , it 's this room . phd g : mm - hmm . ok . mm - hmm . professor b : uh . but the other thing is , he 's putting in w i was using the word `` reverberation `` in two ways . he 's also putting in , uh , a he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . and since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you wo n't . and phd g : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : so you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away . uh , and if it 's a low energy compo portion , you might actually hear some funny things . phd g : yeah . grad e : o o one thing , um , i noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the pzm signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . so i was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ? cuz some of the pzm signals sound pretty quiet if you do n't amplify them . phd c : mm - hmm . i do n't see why why your signal is louder after processing , because yo grad e : yeah . i do n't know why - y , uh , either . phd c : yeah . professor b : i do n't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect . phd c : mm - hmm . grad e : oh , ok . professor b : yeah . i mean , i think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio . phd c : well , well professor b : so if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : but just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio grad e : it w i i it would n't affect things . phd c : yeah . well , the system is use the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on on the signal level . but , not so much , i guess . professor b : well , yeah . but it 's trained and tested on the same thing . so if the if the if you change in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect . phd c : mm - hmm . yeah . phd a : did you add this data to the training set , for the aurora ? or you just tested on this ? grad e : uh um . did i w what ? phd a : well , morgan was just saying that , uh , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it should n't have any effect . grad e : sorry ? yeah . phd a : but i i was sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data . grad e : i i b phd a : you did n't train it also . grad e : i right . i trained on clean ti - digits . i i did the mean subtraction on clean ti - digits . but i did n't i 'm not sure if it made the clean ti ti - digits any louder . professor b : oh , i see . grad e : i only remember noticing it made the , um , pzm signal louder . professor b : ok . well , i do n't understand then . yeah . grad e : huh . i do n't know . if it 's if it 's like , if it 's trying to find a a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter . and then if you take it out that taking it out makes things louder . i mean . professor b : uh , no . i mean , uh , there 's there 's nothing inherent about removing if you 're really removing , grad e : nuh - huh . professor b : uh , r uh , then i do n't see how that would make it louder . grad e : the mean . ok . yeah , i see . professor b : so it might be just some grad e : yeah . ok . so i should maybe listen to that stuff again . professor b : yeah . it might just be some artifact of the processing that that , uh , if you 're uh , yeah . i do n't know . grad e : oh . ok . phd a : i wonder if there could be something like , uh for s for the pzm data , uh , you know , if occasionally , uh , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . uh . i 'm just wondering if there 's something about the , um you know , doing the mean normalization where , uh , it it could cause you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . um . professor b : well , you know , there is this . wait a minute . it it i maybe i if , um subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum . so , depending what you divide by , if your if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're you 're you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger . phd a : mm - hmm . grad e : mm - hmm . professor b : so , it 's it 's just a a question of there 's it it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it grad e : mm - hmm . professor b : uh , y you 'd think it should n't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . that 's something to think about . i do n't know ."
