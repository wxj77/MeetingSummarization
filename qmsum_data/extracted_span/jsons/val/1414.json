    "query": "<s> what did tracey breheny respond to sian gwenllian when discussing continuing mental health service during the lockdown ?",
    "answer": "tracey breheny : of course . thanks , minister . yes , on that question , we moved pretty quickly at the beginning of the pandemic phase to put in place , as the minister said , a weekly monitoring tool of all local health boards , so through that tool , we look at that every week in terms of collecting information . whilst national reporting 's been stood down , we are picking up assurance through that tool on things like staff sickness in camhs services , referral numbers and so on , so we do have that tool in place , and at the moment , that 's telling us that the system can meet the capacity ; has the capacity to meet need . sian gwenllian am : have camhs staff been shifted over to do other work during this virus outbreak ? tracey breheny : there has been some movement , as i 'm saying , around health boards , particularly where in the first phase of the epidemic the concentration was on in-patient provision , providing critical care , but my understanding is from the latest tool that we looked at last week , those staff are gradually not just returning to work from self-isolation or whatever , or from different parts of the system . sian gwenllian am : and then , what about the capacity for camhs primary mental health services ? has there been a reduction in that capacity since the beginning of the pandemic in terms of in-patients ? because that 's what i 'm hearing , that there has been such a reduction , but how are those patients then treated and served ?"
