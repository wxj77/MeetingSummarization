    "query": "<s> what was the direction of travel between universities with high risks and those with medium risks ?",
    "answer": "hefin david am : and a last question : you 've identified one university as high risk , five as medium , and two as low in the short to medium term . you 're obviously not going to tell us which , but what i 'm interested in is the direction of travel , and whether those that are 'medium'\u2014are they at any point at risk of becoming 'high ' in the near future ? dr david blaney : i think it 's fair to say that the direction of travel is that we 're seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in wales , and it 's about the financial pressures that we 've already discussed this morning . and that is why the efforts that the minister has gone to to secure the diamond settlement , and , indeed , other bits of money now and again , are so important . so , she 's doing what she can , and that 's really good , but we always knew that , between the point of the diamond recommendations being made and the full implementation , there was going to be a valley to cross . the new machinery costs more as you phase out the old as well . so , the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure ; there 's a demographic dip , and there are the other contextual factors we 've discussed . we always knew there was going to be a valley . and the institutions have been working very hard to try not to take cost out now that they really do n't have to take out , because they do n't want to reduce capacity , which they 'll struggle to recover again when the financial position improves . so , they are seeing deficits , which are managed deficits , where they 're spending more than their income in order just to keep the capacity in . so , they 're being as responsible as we could expect them to be in this . hefin david am : and , if you 're back in a year or two 's time , the next few years , are we confident that there wo n't be more in the high-risk category ? you said you do n't see collapse , but are we confident there wo n't be more in the high-risk category ? dr david blaney : well , i think what i would always say about this process is that it does n't guarantee 100 per cent accuracy . we can only go on what we can see . so , i wouldn't\u2014 . hefcw is innately cautious as an organisation , so i 'm not going to say we 're confident , but that does n't mean to say we 're worried either . hefin david am : right , okay . so , to answer my question : are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not ?"
