    "answer": "grad e : extremely . grad f : ok , um , so i think the middle block does n't really give you any more information , ex than the top block . and the bottom block similarly only just illus you know , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and and that you can drop the , um uh , that you can give dual types . oh , one thing i should mention is about `` designates `` . i think i 'm actually inconsistent across these as well . so , um , strike out the m subscript on the middle block . professor c : mm - hmm . grad f : so basically now , um , this is actually this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change , which is that `` designates `` is n't only something for the semantics to worry about now . professor c : good . grad f : so we want s `` designates `` to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on . so for instance , if some other construction says , you know , `` are you of type is this part of type whatever `` , um , the `` designates `` tells you which sort of part is the meaning part . ok , so if you have like `` the big red ball `` , you know , you wan na know if there 's an object or a noun . well , ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase . um , there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it 's useful sometimes to talk about , um to talk about there also being a designated object and we think that that 'll be the same one , right ? so the ball is the head of the phrase , `` the r the `` , um , `` big red ball `` , and the entity denoted by the word `` ball `` is sort of the semantic head in some ways of of this sort of , um , in interesting larger element . professor c : a a and the yeah . and there 's uh there 's ca some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head . and and this enables you to get that , if i understand you right . grad e : yeah . grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : yeah . grad f : right , right . grad e : that 's the idea . professor c : yeah yeah . grad e : yeah . grad f : and , uh , you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head - final language , you can refer to the head as a p the , you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision . professor c : right . grad f : so that 's a useful thing so that you can get some internal structural constraints in . professor c : ok , so that all looks good . let me oh , w oh . i do n't know . were you finished ? grad f : um , there was a list of things that is n't included but you you can you can ask a question . that might @ @ it . professor c : ok . so , i if i understand this the aside from , uh , construed and all that sort of stuff , the the differences are mainly that , we 've gone to the possibility of having form - meaning pairs for a type grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : or actually gone back to , grad f : right . professor c : if we go back far enough grad f : well , except for their construction meaning , so it 's not clear that , uh well , right now it 's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type . so i do n't know what a form type is . professor c : oh , i see . yeah , yeah , yeah . i 'm sorry , you 're right . grad f : yeah . professor c : a construction type . uh , that 's fine . but it , um grad f : right . a well , and a previous , um , you know , version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it . so you could say `` construct of type whatever designates something `` . professor c : yeah . grad f : but that was mostly for reference purposes , just to refer to the meaning pole . i do n't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning , which is really what we want most of the time i think . professor c : mm - hmm . grad f : um , i i do n't know if we 'll ever have a case where we actually h if there is a form category constraint , you could imagine having a triple there that says , you know that 's kind of weird . professor c : no , no , no , i do n't think so . i think that you 'll you 'll do fine . grad e : i professor c : in fact , these are , um , as long as as mark is n't around , these are form constraints . so a nominal expression is uh , the fact that it 's animate , is semantic . the fact that it 's n uh , a nominal expression i would say on most people 's notion of of f you know , higher form types , this i this is one . grad f : mm - hmm ."
