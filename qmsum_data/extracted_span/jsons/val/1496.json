    "answer": "marketing : that 's for the main functions i think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people do n't have that may be useful . for instance i think net next slide . one of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you would n't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . so we 've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . young people , probably because it 's a buzz word , find it very relevant . and uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? industrial designer : 'cause marketing : i think if we are targeting young people then uh it 's probably something we have to consider . if we are targeting you very old people this is something they really do n't know why they this should be so now project manager : mm-mm . okay . marketing : this is of course , depends on that . and um i do n't have any conclusion , i did n't have time the meeting was very tight , so that 's basically my findings . and uh , if you have any question ? project manager : mm i think it 's good , okay . you done a good review . user interface : i got one question , marketing : i can go back . industrial designer : thank you . marketing : yeah one question , user interface : uh you are a market expert marketing : yeah ? i am . user interface : should we aim at the young people or not ? marketing : i think we should aim at the young people . but uh i think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . in general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than more than user interface : okay , then teletext is used less . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : then teletext is useless for them i think , user interface : okay . marketing : yeah . because they they have other means of finding their information . yeah . project manager : mm-hmm mm mm . okay . user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : that 's good point . marketing : but yeah . nope . industrial designer : mm , yep . user interface : mm . okay . project manager : okay . marketing : 'kay ?"
