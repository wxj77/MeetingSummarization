    "query": "<s> what did barry hughes think about the registration of grandparents when talking about childcare offer ?",
    "answer": "hefin david am : so , given the point you 've made about grandparents and family , would n't it be sensible , then , to offer a subsidy to grandparents to provide this kind of care ? huw irranca-davies am : unregistered grandparents ? hefin david am : well , through some kind of analysis of that . huw irranca-davies am : well , we do n't think so and there are good reasons behind this . hefin david am : is it because you say that they would n't be registered as carers for their own family member ? huw irranca-davies am : yes , but there 's a deeper reason behind that registration as well . the childcare offer is n't only to just provide childcare ; it 's the wider aspects that come with this . this childcare offer ties into the foundation years offer . there 's an element of education linked to the childcare offer\u2014there 's that 10 hours of the early education foundation years as well . the two tie together . so , there 's an issue here with quality , about socialisation and how children learn in an environment , as opposed to purely\u2014as great as all our grandparents and aunts and uncles are\u2014simply child-minding . that 's one important distinction . so , the focus of this scheme is very much on registered licensed providers , which could be , by the way\u2014because we do have them , and we 're discussing this at the moment internally and with the professional association for childcare and early years and others\u2014grandparents who are actually registered and inspected by the care inspectorate ? we 're having those discussions . hefin david am : how many of them are there ? huw irranca-davies am : we do n't think there is a huge number , but we 're trying to bottom this out at the moment . we have n't got the exact number , but we do n't think they are huge numbers , but there are , in our constituencies , registered , licensed , inspected grandparents who look after other people 's children in a little group of four or five or six or seven , but also their own grandchildren . hefin david am : so , they 're a kind of grandparents club ."
