    "answer": "industrial designer : uh it 's pretty uh much uh like uh mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . with uh the different uh perspectives of it . uh we 'll begin uh with the front . we have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . um with uh the upper part being the front . th so there 's this part um which is made of hard plastic , the front . and uh we 're we 're using different colours . of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and later we 'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . fancy colours . um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device . uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it 's also titanium . you can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . user interface : yeah , it 's a double r_ , but industrial designer : yeah ? user interface : it 's a double r_ . industrial designer : it 's a double r_ . yeah the logo user interface : but it 's very difficult to to draw that in yeah . project manager : yeah , alright . industrial designer : uh uh it 's difficult to draw so small , but it 's our double r_ uh logo is in there . project manager : okay . yeah . industrial designer : um so that 's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . then we have the buttons . uh it 's difficult to draw again the little oval or round i think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . user interface : oval yeah . project manager : alright . industrial designer : so uh oval , n those are here . and then we have the m the m user interface : channel up and volume ? industrial designer : yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons . and also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . we have the okay button . oh nei we uh the okay button 's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and then we 've here the menu button and the project manager : alright . user interface : menu for the lcd screen . industrial designer : and the video button . the project manager : so marketing : mm right . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . and of course this low part , this is the lcd screen . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : uh this is what we made of it . you can make uh suggestions uh if you want . project manager : well if i look at it , the side the side view user interface : well , at the back industrial designer : maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and then you can add suggestions . project manager : oh yeah alright . yeah . industrial designer : maybe i i do n't want to i do n't want to suppress you but n i 'll uh finish this uh quick . um okay i 've had everything i guess on the front ? user interface : no the back . with the logo and our uh l uh industrial designer : yeah the back . yeah . we thought about yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . and we thought about the logo big in the middle . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : just so again the double r_ . we have then the logo on front and on the back . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : maybe that 's too much project manager : okay . industrial designer : but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . user interface : no i do n't think and the industrial designer : and the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : that 's basically what we were thinking about , project manager : okay . industrial designer : and user interface : and about the side view um this the front wo n't be as thick , industrial designer : user interface : but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh project manager : well i see , but industrial designer : oh and uh before i forget . yeah the the voice , of course , project manager : well . yeah i see it . industrial designer : the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . and you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . marketing : project manager : when i look at uh when i look at this side view , i think w when i have that in my hand , it 's terrible . user interface : well , it wo n't be visible . mm ? project manager : if if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . but industrial designer : why ? well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : mean uh the the the the project manager : well what what what i what i agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . marketing : yeah , i agree . user interface : if y if you handle a remote , you you usually do n't have your hand straight like this . industrial designer : in the middle in the user interface : you you have it a bit uh yeah . marketing : it depends on the size . if it 's kinda small , this is is great . but if it 's it 's larger , then you want to grab it . project manager : and how large is it ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , that 's the question . industrial designer : that 's the question . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : uh well yeah . h what do you suggest i mean we do ? this was mike 's prototype , project manager : well uh marketing : industrial designer : and y you seemed to agreed on it . project manager : well the sides i have n't seen yet , uh ? industrial designer : but now you have a totally different . user interface : well , they lay there all the time . industrial designer : the size ? yeah well the size does n't really matter w i mean project manager : they the the the the the side view , industrial designer : side ? uh oh the side ? project manager : we did n't uh industrial designer : w we we he drew the s the side , user interface : yeah yeah . industrial designer : but you d you were n't paying attention as usual . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : well any case , we 'll discuss it now . uh i think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea . marketing : yeah , i agree with the lcd screen . you have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . and if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . project manager : yeah . user interface : industrial designer : but you you hold it like this . user interface : yeah you you do n't you do n't grab it , industrial designer : you 're not holding it like this or something . user interface : you you industrial designer : you , yeah , y how do you call it ? yeah . project manager : industrial designer : well y y y you do n't have it like this . project manager : no no no . industrial designer : you have it more like this . user interface : industrial designer : you you you 're using buttons this way , or if you 're right-handed , this way . marketing : like you 're holding your telephone . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so you yeah . so marketing : because if you have a screen on it , you wan na look at your screen . user interface : hmm . that way , it it falls into your hand . i think . industrial designer : yeah well project manager : okay . industrial designer : and maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , marketing : yeah , i agree on this . industrial designer : so well project manager : marketing : no , i do n't think so . that 's not uh the point user interface : no but but industrial designer : well the the well that 's a reason to to to put the lcd screen uh of course on the upper side , but user interface : well f for as far as i can see , three of us agree project manager : yeah well user interface : and only nils project manager : uh i think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that 's it . user interface : but you 're the project manager , you can make the hard decisions . project manager : yes . so uh i c i c industrial designer : if necessary . project manager : well , we 'll we we 'll do it like this . industrial designer : but uh are d can you live with it ? uh project manager : alright , if you think that that 's the way it should user interface : yeah ? industrial designer : y yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . project manager : no no , industrial designer : but do you project manager : when i i my personal taste is that i want it to fall over my hands with a thick but in the market uh industrial designer : but d you do n't think this is completely unusable i guess . i think . project manager : no not totally . industrial designer : not totally , well project manager : for me , i i would n't buy it . let 's say it like that . industrial designer : yeah but of course y you are also human . we have to take uh every everyone into account . so project manager : no marketing : and you might be uh you might be target customer . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yes but industrial designer : well uh who who else thinks like you ? we do n't know . project manager : yeah , we do n't know , industrial designer : maybe a thousand people , project manager : but that 's uh that 's that 's that 's more market research . industrial designer : or a million people . marketing : project manager : so let it be like this at uh at this moment . industrial designer : let it be . user interface : project manager : okay ?"
