    "answer": "industrial designer : okay . um so i in my personal preferences um i 'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . this would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . and uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it 's compatible with mot most uh televisions . that 's about it . so anything that you would like to know or project manager : okay . user interface : thanks . project manager : do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? industrial designer : no , i do n't have any idea about what each component costs . project manager : br industrial designer : um yeah . project manager : okay . 'cause that 's something to consider , i guess , if we 're if we 're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . industrial designer : yeah . certainly , yeah . so so tha yeah , we definitely need to operate within our constraints , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but um unfortunately i i do not have any data , so uh i just identified the functional components for that . project manager : that 's fine . are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? user interface : i think we need like some general discussion at the end probably ."
