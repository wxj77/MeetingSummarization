    "answer": "suzy davies am : thank you , chair . i just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the minister , i think , about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed , about which children 's rights impact assessments have been done . have any been done , and can they be shared with the committee if they have ? sorry , deputy minister\u2014my mistake . julie morgan am : well , it 's been a very difficult time , as you appreciate , in terms of having to make legislation very quickly , and it has n't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do . however , i am very pleased to say that we 're actually launching a survey of children . we 're going to be launching it next week . and this is to try to get from children their views of what 's happened , what we 've been doing , and their views on the whole covid-19 situation . so , we 're doing this in conjunction with the children 's commissioner and with young wales and with the youth parliament . so , this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children , and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them , what they feel about what 's happened during this period , what they feel about the way that we 've dealt with the schools , the way that they 've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long . and so we 're trying to get feedback from young people . so , i 'm very pleased that we 're doing that , but , in terms of an impact assessment , it has been very difficult , as i 'm sure you can imagine , to be able to do those at these times . i think that albert wants to come in on that . suzy davies am : yes , because i 'll pursue that in a sec . lynne neagle am : albert ."
