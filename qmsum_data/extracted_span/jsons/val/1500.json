    "answer": "industrial designer : two . yeah , if sorry . project manager : you prefer it . industrial designer : yeah . uh as you know , i am mister ramaro . i am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and i previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators . so now i 'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like tv or v_c_r_ or d_v_d_ player etcetera . so we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like tv . so we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . and usually this so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . and then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . it 's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . so , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it 's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are i am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . and then we 'll have the infrared l_e_d_ source which sends the information to the main device . then we 'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different tvs , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so some tvs will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things . project manager : okay . to make it quite uh an universal uh device uh . industrial designer : yeah yeah , because the people do n't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that 's passing information to the tv device . so we need to have particular encryption codes . project manager : okay . industrial designer : then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . uh since i do n't have much time so i 'll input the connections to all this components . and since i also want to know feedback from our marketing expert and user interface , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them . project manager : mm-hmm . and from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , i 'm sure , because since our user interface speech recognition and also marketing expert for the speech recognition is really handy , project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our d_s_b_ chip . since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser project manager : on industrial designer : and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just project manager : uh train it , okay . mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , so that we just use simple recog marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : too complex . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : no but but marketing : but uh very very good to sell . industrial designer : yeah . no , even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . marketing : think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , user interface : okay . okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and ha ha you can not use my remote control , project manager : mm . marketing : because it 's targeted to me . whatever . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and what about the price of this component ? industrial designer : so uh maybe we can make uh it in five euros and even less than that , project manager : it mm okay . marketing : hmm . cheap . industrial designer : because we want to have uh millions and in bulk , marketing : millions . project manager : mm . industrial designer : so we can make really simp project manager : okay . industrial designer : and we want to make really simple device marketing : cheap . industrial designer : because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : then we 'll have something like this um we 'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen . marketing : the user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : or or it will be something like volume , up , down . industrial designer : ye no , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then marketing : okay . project manager : with a keywords and yeah . industrial designer : yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words marketing : okay . project manager : mm-hmm mm . industrial designer : and and because we ca n't really say user to say same wording marketing : couple of words . industrial designer : then it become more mechanical and yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and then we can have channel they can say , okay i want eight , because we do n't know like users have different programmes , i mean they do n't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number , project manager : okay . user interface : okay . industrial designer : we do n't want like b_b_c_ or c_n_n_ or something else marketing : of course uh it has to be industrial designer : because it will be complicated so we 'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , marketing : okay . industrial designer : it 's it it will be take care of our main mm . user interface : no you know it 's a conceptual question , 'cause now i see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , project manager : marketing : but then i think you you user interface : and and he 's coming you know , he 's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . project manager : marketing : first of all i i think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . project manager : no , in no not only speech , yeah . marketing : it 's on top of using the button . project manager : i it 's an option . user interface : okay , for this budget like twelve euros . marketing : well , i dunno . industrial designer : yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this processor and this really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this d_s_p_s . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use d_s_p_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key . user interface : okay . . industrial designer : so it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on tv remote control marketing : tv . project manager : okay . user interface : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . industrial designer : so and we have only few things here project manager : sho to to train , okay . user interface : did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : like , if i want to put volume up i like do mm i take my remote control do like something like marketing : user interface : roll 'em up industrial designer : um uh uh this point we did n't consider user interface : or roll 'em down . marketing : very expensive , industrial designer : because it 's it 's very expensive because v our target is only like twelve point five euros project manager : and well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah . user interface : mm why ? industrial designer : and user interface : that 's just industrial designer : yeah , marketing : and volume control . industrial designer : even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they do n't touch the remote and mm y you do n't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off marketing : so but uh industrial designer : and marketing : sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? so in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . we would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings . project manager : industrial designer : yay yeah . yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they 're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour i project manager : would n't that make uh arguments ? industrial designer : they can make marketing : yeah , of course . project manager : i want uh user interface : industrial designer : yeah we can have marketing : that 's no problem , we will sell more . project manager : and we can increase this the strength user interface : we got a really good market expert . industrial designer : marketing : yeah exactly . project manager : y you can buy one with user interface : let 's send more , let 's sell more . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : okay . project manager : mm-hmm . okay . you have mm something else to say ? uh . industrial designer : uh , not very much , like yeah . marketing : okay . thanks . project manager : okay , thanks . industrial designer : thank you . yep . thank you . project manager : so industrial designer : can you just yeah . project manager : mm i think , okay , we 're just on time . um mm mm . so , we 're now going to l have the lunch break . marketing : mm great . project manager : then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so uh you will focus on the component concept um industrial designer : yeah yeah . project manager : uh of course the u_i_d_ mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept industrial designer : mark will project manager : and uh our m market expert sammy benjo uh on the trend watching . so um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . well i think that 's all . and we have um maybe we have to we say , only for tv , not teletext ? marketing : project manager : uh i think automatic on off control uh it 's not possible . industrial designer : uh it 's in current price , yeah . marketing : difficult . project manager : yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um . industrial designer : yeah . but speech recogniser can be possible . project manager : yeah , implemented . o okay , we can think about that . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : and um do you see something else ? user interface : uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ? marketing : speakers in the remote cont user interface : like , you want to find it , you shout marketing : oh yeah . project manager : uh yeah user interface : control , project manager : that 's user interface : and it answers is i 'm here ? or marketing : it just beeps . user interface : just beeps ? marketing : that would be enough . project manager : or maybe you want to phone him . marketing : something very cheap . project manager : since now all industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah . marketing : but that 's ex that 's expensive . uh . project manager : yeah ? think industrial designer : yeah , especially the power , it really consumes project manager : uh-huh . industrial designer : because it should be all the time on and project manager : and uh marketing : well i i heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they project manager : and it 's answered . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i ca n't whistle . no , no , i ca n't . marketing : you ca n't whistle . uh-huh . project manager : marketing : or a clap . you can clap . can you ? project manager : clap clap clap it 's a good industrial designer : yeah . marketing : clap is good . project manager : i i think it 's universal . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : what about people without hand ? user interface : okay . marketing : just a suggestion . industrial designer : yeah i think it 's good . project manager : yeah . marketing : with only one hand ? these are not our target people . project manager : mm uh okay . industrial designer : but it 's a good feature i guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it . project manager : mm-hmm . okay . user interface : just do n't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping . marketing : mm-hmm . oh that 's e that already exists user interface : yeah , i got it at my home , like . marketing : okay okay . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : oh yeah , you do have . user interface : oops . industrial designer : ah it 's marketing : wow . you 're trendy . project manager : mm-hmm , so let 's to think s so that marketing : think about it . project manager : yeah . i think that could be in the component uh concept uh . marketing : yeah , okay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it yes . okay . marketing : okay . good we 're done ? project manager : yeah , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : let 's go to lunch . industrial designer : thank you , thank you very much ."
