    "answer": "project manager : right . so , um , this one 's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . i got this slide from the coach and i 'm not sure what it 's connected to . um so i guess we are going to discuss um our project process um marketing : industrial designer : user interface : project manager : and that is gon na go into my report . so i guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , i guess , um . industrial designer : okay . marketing : as in within the team or ? project manager : i think so yeah . industrial designer : right so it 's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or marketing : okay . project manager : i think it 's i mm-hmm , i think so . i think hope i 'm not screwing up an experiment . industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : it is now , industrial designer : user interface : marketing : you 're in charge there you go . so user interface : project manager : but i trust that she would jump in if i was so okay fair enough . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : marketing : whatever . project manager : um right , um so any thoughts ? industrial designer : are we considering these points here ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : i think they 're starting blocks yeah . project manager : what do you guys feel about the process ? marketing : um , you know i think in general , for a day 's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : considering the little amount of input we had going in . um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it 's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . user interface : we did n't use the whiteboard at all . project manager : no , no whiteboard . marketing : no , we did n't . we could now if that 'd make up for it user interface : and marketing : but really industrial designer : marketing : and i feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , does n't really matter . user interface : um , also had i not been intrigued about the pen , i do n't think i woulda used it at all , i did n't write barely anything . marketing : yeah i think i was taking notes more often than usual industrial designer : yeah , it 's true . marketing : just 'cause i liked the pen , yeah . project manager : was pretty cool tack though . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : definitely . marketing : mm . i am disappointed i did n't get a note back from my personal coach . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : as you write your personal coach . project manager : marketing : yeah , but i did n't get a response industrial designer : what if you get a response two or three months from now ? user interface : marketing : so project manager : marketing : we 'll see . project manager : industrial designer : that 'd be weird . marketing : okay that would be kinda creepy . project manager : attempts to contact coach ineffective . industrial designer : marketing : well user interface : industrial designer : marketing : what kind of coaching is that really ? what if i really needed something . project manager : industrial designer : user interface : i so n i think there was a lot of room for creativity , i do n't we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . marketing : i think so . and even then we did get a decent product turned out although it 's not everything we wanted it to be . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : with the natural look . project manager : very natural look . industrial designer : that 's very natural . marketing : organic , really . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : that 's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : marketing : and highly resourceful team mates might i add industrial designer : project manager : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : which is always a plus . project manager : yeah , i think , yeah re i thought it was like really creative actually , i mean . user interface : i think the teamwork was good as well . marketing : mm yeah , i 'm impressed . industrial designer : and to prove that we were n't wasteful we did n't waste a single bit of play-doh , we used every bit . marketing : nice . all four of those little containers . project manager : including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . industrial designer : yeah , user interface : industrial designer : i guess user interface : industrial designer : my one my one criticism is that we did n't have enough colours to work with , project manager : user interface : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we only had four , was n't enough . marketing : you could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . project manager : industrial designer : i know it could have been amazing . user interface : marketing : oh well . project manager : what did you guys think about the the the roles ? marketing : they were good . industrial designer : yeah it 's f kind of fun , it was marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . marketing : true . industrial designer : at the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , project manager : marketing : do your own . industrial designer : which was kind of fun . marketing : though i did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i mean maybe it 's just me but i did n't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . project manager : that 's true , i i got this spreadsheet . marketing : nothing , i did n't even get an email , user interface : industrial designer : marketing : that was it . so , yeah , i feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . user interface : well i think that was i think that was an issue i kept finding with regard to marketing : whatever . project manager : of what to do . user interface : well no but also yeah when i was reporting about what each of us was doing i was often confused as to what you were doing marketing : mm-hmm . uh-huh , that was n't very much . industrial designer : you know user interface : um and then i also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion industrial designer : yeah . user interface : which was what the whole project was about project manager : mm , mm . marketing : hmm , very much so . user interface : but and then in the end i think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , industrial designer : yeah . that was fun . i think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the powerpoint slides already put together for you user interface : which was fine . mm-hmm . industrial designer : 'cause if we did n't have that there 's no way we could have got all that done in time . marketing : yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . very much so . project manager : cool . user interface : and i think your leadership was quite good . industrial designer : it was really good yeah . project manager : she said i i i she actually made a comment off boy you 're getting into this and i really i think it 's true i did get i i felt like i got way too into it . marketing : yeah . that 's kind of a good thing though , project manager : i felt like i slipped into it a lot . industrial designer : it 's kinda fun . marketing : you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . project manager : i dunno . user interface : an so is that the first time you 've taken on that kind of role ? project manager : the first time i 've ever done anything like yeah project project management . i usually organise crap , it 's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , user interface : project manager : you know ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : little different . project manager : but you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand industrial designer : yeah . user interface : marketing : and i knew we were all lying through our teeth , industrial designer : user interface : i had to admit , as soon as w we started i mean as soon as we got the play-doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . marketing : other than that industrial designer : marketing : i could only imagine . project manager : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : project manager : maybe in in legos you know ? be fun with legos too , user interface : possibly . project manager : like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with legos user interface : oh yeah , marketing : yeah . totally . project manager : everybody knows best spaceships ever . user interface : still have 'em . project manager : um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? industrial designer : yeah ? marketing : i think so . user interface : project manager : no i , no i dunno , i d i i dunno , industrial designer : you do n't . project manager : i do n't i i was just i marketing : though we did n't actually i mean other than minor discussion at meetings there was n't except for the actual building , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it 's true huh ? marketing : but i feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board well and this would have been six months ' worth of work , not like three hours ' worth of meetings . project manager : yeah . user interface : i think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . i mean industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that 's true . project manager : yeah . course i 'm i 'm conscious of the idea of the project manager asking if you guys feel like there 's a team you know it 's like , kind of like , like hmm . industrial designer : marketing : yeah that is kind of project manager : but yeah . interesting . it 's kind of fascinating was n't it ? i mean the whole process of"
