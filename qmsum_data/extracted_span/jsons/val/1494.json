    "answer": "marketing : so basically uh what i suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let 's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they do n't like and um and what they do with them by the way industrial designer : marketing : because they are supposed to be useful . do n't forget about that . so we 've we 've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and i 'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . and next please . yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user do n't like in remote controls . first of all , they find it very ugly . current remote controls as you know they 're the same as this one uh they 're not nice colour , not nice shape , i mean they 're all the same , and they 're not l good looking . um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control , so i think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um . and the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . for instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so i think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . and most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so i think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . um next please . now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls industrial designer : marketing : and they for instance uh they do n't even find it project manager : marketing : it 's it 's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : agree . marketing : maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : like uh something to to like t i think phones . some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . uh of course phone you can always phone your phone project manager : marketing : but you ca n't phone your your remote control . industrial designer : you can you are . project manager : why not ? marketing : but why not ? yeah . industrial designer : marketing : and because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , in fact they do n't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they do n't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls . and uh they are bad for r_s_i_ but uh i do n't remember what is r_s_i_ . project manager : industrial designer : project manager : okay uh tha that 's look great . marketing : so i think they are bad . user interface : r_s_i_ mm-hmm . industrial designer : marketing : mm-hmm . mm nobody has any idea about that ? well i 'll check uh with my industrial designer : yeah , it 's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect . marketing : oh , okay , user interface : no , i do n't think so . marketing : i think it 's a technical thing industrial designer : yeah , marketing : which our industrial designer : because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , project manager : mm-hmm . okay . marketing : okay . user interface : okay . industrial designer : and those waves have high marketing : so , it seems that it 's a lot of people for a concept that we do n't know user interface : but twenty six percent , do you know project manager : or something we do n't know . mm-hmm . user interface : twenty five . marketing : but we have to take this into account . user interface : every fourth , you know . every four some of us knows . industrial designer : yeah it 's people really marketing : project manager : okay . marketing : so anyway user interface : one of us marketing : that 's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : what else do i have ? next slide ? ah yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so we 've listed a couple of uh user interface : functions . marketing : s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . project manager : marketing : people want to have a power button . channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant . project manager : marketing : ah now i remember what is r_s_i_ project manager : marketing : it 's repetitivity stress injury . we have to be careful with that word but uh anyway i continue my presentation so yeah , user interface : marketing : channel selection is um very important , very often used . volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . and n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . all of them . they 're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . it seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if i personally never use it but seems that it 's average relevant at least , so . project manager : i have been told that we uh do n't consider teletext , that it 's out of date now because of internet . marketing : i can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were had i think ten i think . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but but if you compare with these ones , uh i think they scored a one or two . not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it 's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant . project manager : mm-hmm user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : marketing : that 's for the main functions i think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people do n't have that may be useful . for instance i think net next slide . one of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you would n't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . so we 've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . young people , probably because it 's a buzz word , find it very relevant . and uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? industrial designer : 'cause marketing : i think if we are targeting young people then uh it 's probably something we have to consider . if we are targeting you very old people this is something they really do n't know why they this should be so now project manager : mm-mm . okay . marketing : this is of course , depends on that . and um i do n't have any conclusion , i did n't have time the meeting was very tight , so that 's basically my findings . and uh , if you have any question ? project manager : mm i think it 's good , okay . you done a good review . user interface : i got one question , marketing : i can go back . industrial designer : thank you . marketing : yeah one question , user interface : uh you are a market expert marketing : yeah ? i am . user interface : should we aim at the young people or not ? marketing : i think we should aim at the young people . but uh i think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . in general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than more than user interface : okay , then teletext is used less . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : then teletext is useless for them i think , user interface : okay . marketing : yeah . because they they have other means of finding their information . yeah . project manager : mm-hmm mm mm . okay . user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : that 's good point . marketing : but yeah . nope . industrial designer : mm , yep . user interface : mm . okay . project manager : okay . marketing : 'kay ?"
