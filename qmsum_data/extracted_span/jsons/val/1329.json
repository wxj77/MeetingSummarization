    "answer": "grad a : so i want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . um and jane was gon na talk to , uh , dave johnson about it . one of the things i was thinking is we we just got these hundred alright , excuse me ten , uh sparc - blade sun - blades . professor b : did they come in ? phd f : sun - blades . phd d : yeah . phd f : yeah . they came in the other day . grad a : they came in but they 're not set up yet . and so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they 'll be in the machine room , they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines . and if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them . phd f : well , is there why not just hang them off of abbott , is there a grad a : because there 's no more room in the disk racks on abbott . professor b : yeah . were n't we gon na get phd f : ah , i see . professor b : well , maybe it should get another rack . phd d : but you still need to store the disks somehow . grad a : well , but the sun - blades have spare drive bays . phd d : so grad a : just put them in . phd f : you can put two phd d : oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the grad a : sure . phd c : internal . yeah . grad a : yeah . cuz the sun uh , these sun - blades take commodity hard drives . so you can just go out and buy a pc hard drive and stick it in . professor b : but if abbott is going to be our disk server it it file server { comment } it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something . phd d : plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh , file server . grad a : well , i mean there are lots of long term solutions . what i 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ? phd d : i see oh , i see . professor b : well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , might n't you ? uh , you know dave johnson is gone for , like , ten days , grad a : oh , i did n't know he had left already . professor b : yeah . no . i think dave dave knows all these things , of course . an - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gon na do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time . phd d : right . mm - hmm . grad a : but i i know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk . and so i think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back the back up system , rather than on new disk . phd d : mmm . mmm . grad a : so . which professor b : well . so . but this this is a very specific question for me . basically , we can easily get one to four disks , i mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , it 's no big deal . uh , but the question is where they go , and i do n't think we can solve that here , you just have to ask him . phd d : maybe we can put some disks in the in that back room there . grad a : yeah really . professor b : attach to grad a : popcorn . professor b : yeah ? phd d : to the machine that collects the data . so then you could , at least temporarily , store stuff there . grad a : yeah , it 's just it 's not on the net , so it 's a little awkward phd d : the only what do you mean it 's not on the net ? grad a : it 's not phd c : it 's not bad . grad a : it 's behind lots of fire walls that do n't allow any services through except s s phd d : oh because it 's because it 's an aciri machine ? professor b : yeah . phd d : oh , oh oh . grad a : and also on the list is to get it into the normal icsi net , but who knows when that will happen ? phd d : but that ca n't be that hard . phd f : that might be a good short term solution , though . phd d : i mean grad a : no , the the problem with that apparently is that they do n't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the icsi routers . so , they actually have to run a wire somewhere . professor b : yeah . yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal . if there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's it 's jus every ever everybody everybody has a has"
