    "answer": "suzy davies am : it 's not directly about usw ; it 's about the geographic spread of provision . i wonder if you could just give us a snapshot of what that looks like , and whether you think\u2014certainly for pgce or postgrad courses , anyway\u2014that if they 're not accessible geographically and we 've got students who already have three years ' worth of debt , they 're not going to be looking to , necessarily , live away from home for a fourth year , and may want to study nearer home . has there been any research done on the access to these postgrad courses , about where people are coming from and whether that 's had an impact on the fact that some of these places have n't been filled ?"
