    "answer": "llyr gruffydd am : okay . so , moving on , then , to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness , of course , which is an important one to address . clearly , one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children , hopefully , later on in life . i want to come back to this point that the children 's commissioner for wales and others have raised : the concern that , actually , the most disadvantaged\u2014those from workless households\u2014are being excluded from this policy . is n't there therefore a risk that they 'll be left even further behind ? huw irranca-davies am : i 've had long , detailed and positive discussions with the children 's commissioner on this , and i know the children 's commissioner would want a more universal offer , but i make two points on that : one is , that was not what the commitment in the manifesto was , and it 's not the offer that 's being taken forward now . it is a different thing , a universal offer , and there are issues around that with complexity , and also affordability . but it is n't the offer that we took forward into government ; this is what we 're taking forward . but it is interesting in terms of that aspect of families then who lose out . i 'd say two significant things on it : one is , this does n't stand alone purely as 30 hours of childcare . within this , there are 10 hours of the foundation years , educational input , which is there for everybody . but before that , particularly for those disadvantaged families , before we even get to that stage , you have schemes such as flying start , and i know this committee has looked in detail at flying start and has said that it would like to see it rolled out everywhere . if i had all the money under the sun , i would really do that , chair ; i would really do it . but i do n't have all the money under the sun . llyr gruffydd am : but you do have the ability to target the money . huw irranca-davies am : yes , but the fact that flying start , we know , is leading to those outcomes where those children , in quite challenged circumstances very often , are more ready to step up to the foundation year , are more ready , then , to step through into mainstream education in later years\u2014those things tie together . so , there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family , by the way , within this offer , let alone the childcare . that does n't mean that everybody 's excluded , but it does mean , yes , that this offer is focused on working parents . and we do n't think that that 's a bad thing . in fact , it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election , which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags , which is , ' i ca n't afford to go back to work because i ca n't afford the childcare . do n't tell me to go back to work , i ca n't afford it . ' llyr gruffydd am : the majority of disadvantaged children do n't live in flying start areas , do they ? huw irranca-davies am : yes , indeed . llyr gruffydd am : so , there 's a missing cohort there that ca n't access one or the other , and the school readiness gap is growing , and , really , are we focusing our resources in the right place here ? huw irranca-davies am : well , yes , in terms of this scheme , but it does n't sit alone as this scheme\u2014it 's the wider plethora of , i have to say , progressive and advanced initiatives that we have in wales that take different forms . it 's not only flying start that provides that other support for parents , and readiness not only for the parents and for their children , but also the support into work . so , if , for example , you look at the parents , childcare and employment programme , which is separate from this , there is support there for every parent in terms of helping them get supported into work from disadvantaged families . if you look at the support for the children , we 've got the 10 hours that sits within the sphere of the education , but we 've also got all the other family intervention programmes that help with socialisation , education and so on and so forth . if you look at this solely on its own and say , 'well , there is nothing else there ; the rest of wales is a desert and there 's no support for parents , for getting parents back into work or for those parents who are not seeking to go back into work but also need the support and for their children in education ' , i 'd be worried . but , actually , this fits as part of the jigsaw that we have in wales , where i think we are well ahead of the other nations . yes , we could do more , and i always say , llyr ; i always say , chair , that if i had\u2014i do n't have a chequebook at all , because it 's not in my gift\u2014if i had a blank cheque i 'd do a lot more , but we do n't . but what we can do is get the right schemes in place , and if this helps drive more choices for working parents , including , by the way\u2014 . there are niceties within this as well ; it does n't have to be that both parents are working . you could have a parent who is on incapacity benefit . you could have a parent who is a registered carer . they would qualify for the scheme . those will be some of those most disadvantaged families that we both have those concerns about . so , there is some flexibility within this scheme as well to deal with some of those disadvantaged families . lynne neagle am : darren on this . darren millar am : i am surprised by the answer there , particularly given that one of the ambitions of the government is to close this attainment gap later in life when schoolchildren get to their examinations , when they 're 16 years old . yet this appears to be driving a bigger wedge in terms of development , which could , of course , lead to a perverse outcome later on in life , but i do n't want to ask you about that . if i can just very quickly ask you : has consideration been given to making free childcare available to parents where they 're in 16 hours or more of education each week ? so , they may not be entering the labour market , but , of course , one of those barriers to them getting back into the labour market could well be their education , so what arrangements are in place there ? huw irranca-davies am : darren , we have considered it , and we have n't included it within the scheme because this is designed to enable parents to go into work , not into training to enable them to get into work . there are other forms of support available for parents in terms of college and so on and so forth , but it 's not this scheme . darren millar am : but it 's not prescribed support , is it ? you know , it 's not universally available to people who might be wanting to get back into the labour market over that barrier . you must have done some costings , then , if you 've considered it , and you must have tried to identify numbers . huw irranca-davies am : i 'm looking to my left and my right . owain lloyd : not at this point . huw irranca-davies am : we haven't\u2014 darren millar am : so , you have n't considered it that much , have you ? huw irranca-davies am : we have actually considered\u2014 . we consider it from the point of , 'what is this scheme set up to do ? ' it 's very clear . when we ran , in the manifesto on this point\u2014 darren millar am : i understand that . i do n't want you to repeat yourself because i know we are against the clock . but , very specifically , when you say you 've considered it , what you mean is you thought about it but you 've not costed it , you 've not identified the numbers that might be involved\u2014 huw irranca-davies am : absolutely , absolutely . darren millar am : and therefore you 've not considered whether it might be affordable in addition to the policy objective that this is trying to meet . huw irranca-davies am : no , darren , you 're right : we have n't considered affordability because we 've considered it on first principles to do with what this offer is trying to do . it does n't fit within the offer so , as such , why would we do the costings ? darren millar am : perhaps i can frame my question in another way . are you prepared to consider it if you 're able to identify the numbers and potential cost ? huw irranca-davies am : ah , right , okay . we 'd be interested in your thoughts as a committee , but it does n't actually fit within the first principles of what the scheme is designed to do . darren , can i just pick up on your point , in case you misinterpreted what i was saying to llyr ? i drew attention in my answer to llyr to schemes such as the pace scheme . in gwynedd , one of our pilot areas , they are combining the team around the family with this childcare offer . so , what they are doing is wrapping the support around . it is not the case , as you 've suggested then , that there is somehow more disadvantage being heaped on other families . what this does is tie in in those pilot areas with the existing provision , and that's the way we want to see it work . so , i would n't want you to be under any misapprehension that this makes conditions worse for families . those families who have a registered carer in them where one parent works , and those families who have somebody on incapacity benefit will qualify for the scheme . all families will qualify for the 10 hours of education . in gwynedd , they 're wrapping the team around the family with this offer\u2014 darren millar am : but on the other hand , minister , you 've also suggested that this will accelerate child development for those kids who are able to access it , and yet not all kids will be able to access it , particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds . huw irranca-davies am : but all children can access the 10 hours , and they can access flying start\u2014 darren millar am : but 10 hours is very different to 30 hours , is it not ? huw irranca-davies am : yes , but they can access flying start or they can access the team around the family\u2014 darren millar am : if they 're in a flying start area . huw irranca-davies am : \u2014or they can be in a children 's zone area or they can\u2014 darren millar am : if they 're in those areas . lynne neagle am : right , i 've got john and then david , and the questions and answers are going to have to be brief , please . john griffiths am : yes , certainly , chair . in terms of child development and how this fits with wider welsh government strategy , huw , i 'd be interested in what you 'd have to say about the quality of childcare . we 're talking a lot about quantity , but obviously we want to up quality , and that 's recognised by welsh government . they 've talked about increasing the qualifications within the workforce , and the quality . i just wonder how that sits within the \u00a34.50 , because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there , and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place . huw irranca-davies am : john , you 're absolutely right , and two things on that : i visited one of the facilities in the valleys the other day that was taking this forward\u2014a very good independent sector-run childcare provision , with welsh language and english language running alongside each other , and i asked the point about the integration , curiously , but what they were doing was\u2014 . their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we 'd want to see : not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects\u2014 . so , it was hard to differentiate , in some ways , what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding , and including the nutritional stuff and all of that . now , that is the model we need to see , and the \u00a34.50 seems to work , at the moment , for that . it 'll be interesting , as we discussed previously , as it goes forward\u2014 . we need to look at whether that works , going forward . but the quality , i think , is key , and that 's why we 're focused very much on registered inspected providers , as opposed to every tom , dick and harriet . john griffiths am : if we want to increase salary levels , though , which i think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality , then obviously that might impact on the \u00a34.50 rate ."
