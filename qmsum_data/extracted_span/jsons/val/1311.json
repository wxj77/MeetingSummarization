    "query": "<s> how would the allocation contribute to educational research ?",
    "answer": "sian gwenllian am : your remit requires you to encourage universities to continue to develop one particular element of research , which is educational research . how does your allocation for 2019-20 contribute to that in terms of pedagogy and educational research specifically ? dr david blaney : bethan , did you want to say something on this ? bethan owen : i was just going to add that , when we look at the funding that comes into our sector in wales , compared with the rest of the uk , it 's easy to see from the figures that our percentage of income that comes from research is smaller than in england , so the figures show that we receive less of the money that 's available , which is a factor that results from us having less qr as a percentage , so we 're in a situation where we get less of that uk funding that 's available as well . sian gwenllian am : so , there 's a knock-on to that ; that 's what you 're trying to say . but from the point of view of my question on educational research\u2014 ? dr david blaney : so , we have provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to wiserd education , which is a research collaboration between a number of the welsh universities , specifically looking at educational issues , and we 're providing additional funding to that to add value to the welsh government 's existing evaluation of the progress of pioneer schools in developing the three-to-15 curriculum in wales . i wo n't go into the full detail of it now , but it 's a five-partner project feeding into this with researchers from cardiff , cardiff met , trinity saint david , aber , bangor and the university of south wales . so , it 's a collaborative effort , and we have , in the past , also funded wiserd education , so it 's an important research facility and increasingly being used , i 'm delighted to say , by welsh government in underpinning its own policy thinking . sian gwenllian am : and likewise , in 2019-20 , there will be allocations specifically for this . dr david blaney : it 's a bit early to say yet . we have n't allocated anything specifically in the main allocations that we 've put out . there might be others to come , but we 're not yet in a position to say . sian gwenllian am : okay . well , could you provide the remit letter from\u2014 [ inaudible . ] \u2014do that ? you have to do everything in the remit letters ."
