    "answer": "project manager : okay . so welcome back . marketing : project manager : what do do we have to do ? marketing : . project manager : so first . i want to say i 'm the secretary , so i make the minutes . you find them in your in the map in the from the group . there 's the minutes from the first meeting . you 'll find the next minutes also there . then i wan na hear from you , what you 've done . and after that i have some new product requirements . so and after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . and then we 're ready . we have forty minutes for this meeting . after that we 'll have lunch . so first i wan na ask the industrial designer to tell what he did . so industrial designer : that 's my task . okay . uh i 've where have i put it ? my documents or not ? hmm . i 've save it on my computer , my presentation . project manager : yeah on your computer , or the industrial designer : but where ? project manager : what 's the name ? industrial designer : uh uh uh project manager : what 's the name of it ? industrial designer : it was about the working of the remote control . project manager : it 's the technical function or the functional requirements . industrial designer : nope . project manager : industrial designer : not a of wait . the working design . but i 've saved it . project manager : working design . industrial designer : but now i do n't know where it is . hmm . project manager : working design . what is this ? product documents . industrial designer : yeah . and i import this until project manager : on the desktop . up . up . up . up . industrial designer : one more . project manager : yes . my documents . nope . industrial designer : what the fuck is this ? project manager : gone . well you um nah . nah , nah , nah . industrial designer : project manager : powerpoint . working design . industrial designer : yeah that 's the empty one . project manager : and industrial designer : i had one . project manager : presentation of working design . industrial designer : uh-huh . open it . okay here it is . project manager : save as . marketing : project manager : uh it 's marketing : desktop . project manager : project . industrial designer : project . marketing : yeah . okay . well . project manager : save . industrial designer : okay . project manager : very good . industrial designer : a little later but here it is . project manager : okay . so marketing : industrial designer : so okay . it 's a little difficult what i 'm gon na tell you . it 's about the working of the remote control . i just had an half an hour j to study it user interface : industrial designer : and i do n't get it . marketing : make it . project manager : now have ten minutes to tell it . industrial designer : ten minutes to tell it . okay . i think it will be a few minutes and project manager : okay . industrial designer : first uh i will tell you something about the findings , what i discovered about the remote control . the working bout it uh of it . uh then i 'll have uh some kind of map , and it 's the top of the remote control . with a little bit of science , uh you i will show that uh in in a few minutes . and then uh what i 'll think about it . first , the findings . the remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who have n't seen a remote control uh inside . uh there 's a lot of uh plastic on it , marketing : industrial designer : um because its uh not so expensive . and there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . there 's a lot of small uh electronics . so it wo n't be um uh too expensive to build it . only twelve euro fifty i think uh we will make it . now and here i have the top of the remote control . uh here 's some kind of chip . uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . uh you have all on your remote control . and uh the teletext uh button . and uh here 's the battery . and when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . and the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . that 's what i said , it 's very difficult . project manager : industrial designer : and after that it will be sent to the infrared . and that will send it to your television . that 's a short h uh how it works . uh i think i can uh make it uh difficult , but we all we all do n't get it . my preferences ? it 's uh it wo n't be uh we should n't make it too big . uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . a long-lasting battery . uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . not other materials . also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . we can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button . and then um that that you will see it on the tv . and on the tv you can uh switch into the menu . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : that 's i think it 's easier . and the bleep signal , y uh you told us . uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery 's empty , then there is a bleep . then you 'll have to change it in a in a week or something . and also the bleep , when what i told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . this is uh just uh project manager : oh oh . two questions . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : the battery . you say one battery is cheaper . why ? industrial designer : if we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two . project manager : yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer . industrial designer : yeah but then we 'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . project manager : okay so it 's the size of the remote control . industrial designer : just yeah . project manager : okay and the buttons . when you use it on the television , you 've you need the television , wh which can use it . industrial designer : yeah . but uh i think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? project manager : okay . industrial designer : or is it also for other company uh for other televisions ? project manager : i think we have to use it also on other televisions though . industrial designer : then this is an option . project manager : so industrial designer : maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . and then we make it easier uh for our televisions . and on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we wo n't use the project manager : yeah but i do n't i think it they are two different things though . we have to choose one . it has to work on o uh all televisions . industrial designer : yeah ? okay . then i think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . and we will uh look forward and do n't make a remote control which for the older televisions . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and i just uh have one more idea . uh maybe it 's one of your tasks . but uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the nokia um mobile phones . to change covers . so if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . and then you can put a red cover on it . and also different things . project manager : yeah . good idea . marketing : will this will this add to the cost ? industrial designer : uh then it wo n't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . and then you can buy the covers . marketing : yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . d does it make it more difficult to design ? industrial designer : i think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : not much . 'kay . industrial designer : just like with the nokia uh mobile phones . project manager : yeah but there are much more nokia telephones than um these ones . industrial designer : just one . project manager : industrial designer : yeah but then we 'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . if it wo n't works then we 'll get something else . then we uh wo n't g uh go further with it . project manager : yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ? industrial designer : uh a p a a cover made in uh in china , it it wo n't be i guess so expensive i think . project manager : yeah but there are also design cost . i do n't think when you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? would you change the cover ? industrial designer : maybe . i wi i wo n't . but maybe i think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh i made a picture on it . uh project manager : n yeah but i think that too less people would change it for good profit . so industrial designer : yeah . okay . and the other people ? what do you think about it ? marketing : um user interface : yeah it 's a good idea . but if if it yeah , i do n't i 'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh industrial designer : okay . user interface : but it 's uh yeah it 's uh original idea . project manager : yes it is but i do n't think we have to do it . industrial designer : okay . you 're the project manager . project manager : okay . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : yes . that 's it . project manager : that 's clear . okay thank you . so now the user interface designer . user interface : oh . that 's me . uh come on . . ah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yes well uh uh i shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . industrial designer : user interface : um i thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the tv set . uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . no cords attached . and uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . that was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . uh i find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . uh well the same idea here . uh message to the television . and uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that . uh well these are two uh remotes , and that 's our uh our dilemma i think . uh we just heard from the industrial designer how uh difficult it is . but uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . or uh uh more functions on the remote . uh maybe more devices you can influence . uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh v_c_r_ . yeah well that 's our dilemma . um any ideas about that ? basic or multifunctional ? project manager : we 'll got back on that later . user interface : okay yeah . yeah well the that was just on my mind . so uh i did n't know what uh what way we would go . mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk . industrial designer : 'kay . project manager : 'kay , thank you . then it 's your turn , the marketing expert . marketing : okay . uh um m yeah . um yeah okay . this bit too far . project manager : industrial designer : user interface : marketing : so so i 'm uh gon na have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . and we looked at uh several um things . uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . uh well what what will be our market . and uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . if um that would be a good idea or not . well our findings . uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . um uh they especially found found them very ugly . and um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . uh well they also zap a lot . so uh zapping uh should be very easy . and uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . so a lot of unused buttons . there is more findings . uh on the buttons . which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? and how much would they use them ? well uh the most used button is the channel selection . and uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . the power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . uh not important they found the audio , uh that 's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . uh the screen and the brightness . and uh channel settings . uh th and they also are not used very often . then we have a few um graphs about the market . uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . and to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh i do n't think uh , i i think the younger will be most interest in it . but uh they are not a very big group . um in the we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . if you have an lcd on the remote control , what would you think of it . now you can clearly see young users say . i will that would very nice . and older user think uh they will be scared of change i think . industrial designer : marketing : and they wo n't like it . and another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . well here we see the same . young users uh think that 's an interesting idea . and old users not . uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim . uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . and um they are more critical on their money spending . uh the second group is the older group . aged between forty six and sixty five . they are less interested in uh new features . but uh they spend their money more easily . now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . and the second group about forty percent . so the the first group is bigger . well then i come to my uh personal preferences . uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group does n't say that old people wo n't buy it . but less of them will buy it . um well i uh okay . what i thought , um even young people say it 's hard to use , remote control . so if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that 's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . and um we can make special features . but uh i think it looks nice in the first time . but when use it , uh i do n't know what 's uh good thing of speech recognition . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : um well th uh that 's my second point . industrial designer : marketing : uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . it 's about discussion we had earlier . um you can find most functions on a tv set . so uh you do n't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . and such things . um well the design is very important . one thing i did not say i think , is that a lot of users also said then i would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . but they found most remote controls very ugly . so the design of our remote control is very important . and uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . that were my findings . project manager : okay thank you . industrial designer : yeah . i have uh one question . if we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like lcd or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh i think we do n't have that in our budget . do you think ? user interface : and i do n't uh i do n't think twenty five euros for a remote is really cheap or something . industrial designer : like no . no . user interface : so it 's yeah , it 's hard to uh get the younger group . industrial designer : uh-huh . project manager : i think uh the lcd is cheaper than speech recognition . so i think that can be an d good option . lcd . user interface : mm-hmm . just the lcd ? project manager : yes . only the lcd . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : so but we 'll come back on that . marketing : okay . project manager : now oh , go on . what d d d um um uh we go back on the decisions later . now we have a few new product requirements . first , teletext . we have internet now so we do n't need the teletext anymore . so not necessary . industrial designer : project manager : next . only for the television . so we do n't look at the other things like the radio or something . only the television . we look at the age group of forty plus . uh no , younger than forty . is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . fourth point . our corporate colour and slogan must be used . very important for the design . so you can see it on our site . marketing : project manager : next . um no . we have to make our decisions , what we want to do . so like you said , we need the . maybe it 's good to put it in a document . now we have to decide what controls do we need . so maybe you can tell us . marketing : yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said . project manager : sorry ? marketing : the the requirements you just said , maybe we should first have a discussion about that . project manager : yes , it 's okay . marketing : i uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . uh not everyone um who is looking tv can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . project manager : yeah but we do n't use it . it 's a new requirement . marketing : project manager : so , it 's not my requirement . industrial designer : 'kay , we 'll just have to do that . project manager : we have to do this . industrial designer : okay . no discussion about it . marketing : okay . okay sorry . then uh user interface : industrial designer : okay . unfortunately . marketing : project manager : so what controls do we need ? who first ? user interface : well a power button ? marketing : project manager : okay . uh power . user interface : uh the well um i think separate channels . so project manager : uh mm channel . user interface : but then both the the separate channels . so so uh zero to nine or something . project manager : channel zero to nine . user interface : uh volume . project manager : volume . maybe it 's easy to pick . what was w your one ? techno marketing : mine ? it 's the functional requirements . project manager : okay . we had w uh no no no no . where was that example of the user interface : oh mine . project manager : johan . that was the the the the the user interface : technical . project manager : technical hallo . okay . what do we need ? on-off . zero to nine . industrial designer : to change to the next channel , just one button . to move up , move down . project manager : yeah that 's the channel . marketing : d yeah . do we make a menu ? project manager : menu ? uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . uh marketing : uh project manager : m menu . i think um the only one or two numbers . user interface : mm yes . project manager : and hello ? that 's ch marketing : i think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . up-down for channel selection , and left-right uh for volume . and uh a menu uh button . and if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . but the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . project manager : on the lcd screen , you mean ? marketing : uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the tv . or you get the menu on the lcd screen on the remote control . project manager : think it 's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . so we need industrial designer : but then we come to the costs . project manager : n yes . but if we have this marketing : 'kay . but well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . and also to find the easy to use uh part very important . so if we have a lcd sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , i think that will incre uh uh even when it 's a bit more cost , it will still sell . project manager : so now we do n't have a lot of buttons . is this enough ? user interface : mute . project manager : mute . maybe in the menu ? user interface : um yeah but then it 's always uh more than one uh thing to do . project manager : mute . mm-hmm . okay . marketing : yeah . project manager : maybe more ? no . well . then that 's all . this will be the buttons . and i think that 's enough for the next phase . so we can go on to industrial designer : but now we have only the buttons . and uh we do n't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? or project manager : no that 's for the next phase . industrial designer : okay . project manager : um phase two is the conceptual design . so then we 'll have the concepts . industrial designer : okay . okay . project manager : that 's for the so uh next point . now we have lunch-break . after that we have t thirty minutes for work . and you can find the minutes in the project documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . no . your individual action , you can find them in the email . so now it 's time for lunch . industrial designer : okay . marketing : okay . good idea . project manager : thanks for coming ."
