    "answer": "phd c : yeah . grad a : and , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once , in a lot of different ways . phd c : yeah . phd f : oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too . grad a : yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers , phd c : yeah . grad a : so all of those need to be expanded , and then people are doing chunking and i want to do uh , uh , uh , the permission forms , phd f : mm - hmm . right . grad a : so i want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . um and jane was gon na talk to , uh , dave johnson about it . one of the things i was thinking is we we just got these hundred alright , excuse me ten , uh sparc - blade sun - blades . professor b : did they come in ? phd f : sun - blades . phd d : yeah . phd f : yeah . they came in the other day . grad a : they came in but they 're not set up yet . and so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they 'll be in the machine room , they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines . and if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them . phd f : well , is there why not just hang them off of abbott , is there a grad a : because there 's no more room in the disk racks on abbott . professor b : yeah . were n't we gon na get phd f : ah , i see . professor b : well , maybe it should get another rack . phd d : but you still need to store the disks somehow . grad a : well , but the sun - blades have spare drive bays . phd d : so grad a : just put them in . phd f : you can put two phd d : oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the grad a : sure . phd c : internal . yeah . grad a : yeah . cuz the sun uh , these sun - blades take commodity hard drives . so you can just go out and buy a pc hard drive and stick it in . professor b : but if abbott is going to be our disk server it it file server { comment } it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something . phd d : plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh , file server . grad a : well , i mean there are lots of long term solutions . what i 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ? phd d : i see oh , i see . professor b : well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , might n't you ? uh , you know dave johnson is gone for , like , ten days , grad a : oh , i did n't know he had left already . professor b : uh , well , tonight . grad a : oh , oh well . phd d : you mean he wo n't set up the mmm . professor b : i do n't know . grad e : how much space do you need for these ? professor b : i do n't know what his schedule is . grad a : you we need about a gig per meeting . professor b : i 'm just saying he 's gone . phd f : i i thi grad e : i have um i have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . grad a : alright ! what 's your computer 's name ? grad e : so uh , samosa . professor b : you had an eighteen gigabyte drive . grad e : yeah , i had . well it 's about i think there 's about twelve gig left . grad a : so it and you have an x drives installed ? ok . grad e : yeah . so , i did n't realize it was so critical . grad a : and you 're o you 're offering ? grad e : i mean i 'm not doing anything on it right now until i get new meetings to transcri or that are new transcriptions coming in i really ca n't do anything . um not that i ca n't do anything , i jus phd f : i i jus i just gave thilo some about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on on uh abbott . uh and uh so but that but grad a : which one was that , x g ? x g ? phd f : yeah . phd d : that 's also where we store the the uh hub - five training set waveforms , phd c : oops . grad a : but that wo n't be getting any bigger , phd d : right ? grad a : will it ? phd f : i do n't think that 's on xg . phd d : right . phd f : on xg is only carmen and du - and stephane 's disk . phd c : it 's yeah . phd d : but i 've also been storing i 've been storing the feature files there and i guess i can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are grad e : well phd d : and we wo n't be using the old ones anymore . grad e : i have a lot of space , though . phd f : yeah , i do i do n't think it was on xg . phd d : uh oh thats xa oh that 's x phd c : is n't that xh ? grad a : not not for long . grad e : i have a lot of space and it 's not it 's n there 's very little uh yeah not for long . phd d : maybe i 'm confu grad e : but i mean it 's not going f phd d : oh no i 'm sorry . grad e : it 's not being used often at all . phd c : but i 'm using xh h , too . grad a : yeah , it 's probably probably only about four gig is on x on your x drive , phd d : oh ok . grad a : but we 'll definitely take it up if you phd d : i think you 're right . it 's xh and d grad e : i think it 's about four or five gig cuz i have four meetings on there , phd d : the b i 'm also using dg i got that confused . grad e : three or four meetings . grad a : great . ok , so that will get us through the next couple days . professor b : we need we need another gigaquad . grad a : yep . at least . professor b : there should i d there should just be a b i should have a button . grad a : the `` more disk space `` button ? professor b : just press press each meeting saying `` we need more disk space `` `` this week `` . skip the rest of the conversation . phd f : well we 've collected so far something like uh sixty - five meetings . professor b : and and how much does each meeting take ? phd f : and it 's about a gig uncompressed . phd c : it 's it 's a little bit more as i usually do n't do not uncompress the all of the pzm and the pda things . phd f : is a little more ? right , yeah so if you uncompressed everything it 's even more . phd c : it 's yeah . one point five or something . phd f : u uh compressed how much are they ? like grad a : half a gig . for all of them . phd f : about half ? phd c : yeah . yeah . yep . phd f : so we 're definitely are storing you know , all of those . so there 's what thirty some gig of just meetings so far ? professor b : so - so so maybe there 's a hundred gig or something . or i mean . cuz we we have the uncompressed around also . phd f : mm - hmm . right . professor b : so it 's like phd c : yeah . phd f : right . well we we have n't uncompressed all the meetings , but grad a : i would like to . professor b : yeah . well i mean it 's the they really are cheap . i mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , phd f : right . professor b : but but uh , we could you know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . i mean it 's it 's small i mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars . phd f : yeah . well i sent that message out to , i guess , you and dave asking for if we could get some disk . professor b : yeah . phd f : i s i sent this out a a day ago grad a : and put it where ? professor b : right . phd f : but and dave did n't respond so i don i do n't know how the whole process works . i mean does he just go out and get them and if it 's ok , and so i was assuming he was gon na take over that . but he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving . professor b : yeah , i think you need a direct conversation with him . and just say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . and in my answer back was `` are you sure you just want one ? `` so i mean i think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure `` well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months `` . phd f : yeah . grad a : wa - a i know what they want . the sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine . so they do n't want to stack up external drives . professor b : yeah . grad a : um and then they want everything else in the machine room . professor b : right . grad a : so the question is where are you gon na hang them ? phd f : mm - hmm . i do n't know what the space situation is in the machine room . grad a : right . professor b : right . so this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave , phd d : th - the phd f : i think part of the reason why dave ca n't get the the new machines up is because he does n't have room in the machine room right now . professor b : cuz it phd d : one mmm . one one on - one thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is phd f : so he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff . phd d : i bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh , around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and and you know recover the space . professor b : yeah . no . i think dave dave knows all these things , of course . an - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gon na do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time . phd d : right . mm - hmm . grad a : but i i know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk . and so i think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back the back up system , rather than on new disk . phd d : mmm . mmm . grad a : so . which professor b : well . so . but this this is a very specific question for me . basically , we can easily get one to four disks , i mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , it 's no big deal . uh , but the question is where they go , and i do n't think we can solve that here , you just have to ask him . phd d : maybe we can put some disks in the in that back room there . grad a : yeah really . professor b : attach to grad a : popcorn . professor b : yeah ? phd d : to the machine that collects the data . so then you could , at least temporarily , store stuff there . grad a : yeah , it 's just it 's not on the net , so it 's a little awkward phd d : the only what do you mean it 's not on the net ? grad a : it 's not phd c : it 's not bad . grad a : it 's behind lots of fire walls that do n't allow any services through except s s phd d : oh because it 's because it 's an aciri machine ? professor b : yeah . phd d : oh , oh oh . grad a : and also on the list is to get it into the normal icsi net , but who knows when that will happen ? phd d : but that ca n't be that hard . phd f : that might be a good short term solution , though . phd d : i mean grad a : no , the the problem with that apparently is that they do n't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the icsi routers . so , they actually have to run a wire somewhere . professor b : yeah . yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal . if there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's it 's jus every ever everybody everybody has a has grad a : but dave has to do all of them . professor b : well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing . but at any rate i think that there 's a there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need and i think we need a a conversation with uh , maybe maybe after after tea or something you and i can go down and and talk to him about it just say `` wha you know , what should we do right now ? `` phd f : how long is david gon na be gone ? professor b : uh , eleven days or something ? grad a : oh my ! professor b : yeah basically tomorrow and all of the week after . grad a : and that 's all i have . professor b : um let 's see . the only oth thing other thing i was gon na add was that um uh , i talked briefly to mari and uh we had both been busy with other things so we have n't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the friday after next . and i i i wanted to make it , um after the next one of these meetings , so something that we wan na do next meeting is is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . i mean just sort of bulletize i mean o e do do i can i can dream up text but this is basically gon na lead to the annual report . so um if w phd d : mm - hmm . grad a : this is the fifteenth ? so just a week from tomorrow ? professor b : um , that would yeah . yeah . so , uh , we can this so that 's an phd d : is this got ta be in the morning ? professor b : um phd d : or because you know i fridays i have to leave uh like around uh two . so if it could be before that would be be professor b : no , no but i i i do n't need other folks for the meeting . i can do it . a a all i 'm saying is that on phd d : oh , ok , alright . oh i 'm sorry , i misunderstood ."
