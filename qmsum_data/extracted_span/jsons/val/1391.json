    "answer": "marketing : well , i 'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um to start with these points . uh next sheet ? um at first i tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it 's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . uh , furthermore it 's very important what they do like and what they do use . um then i tell something about um the most important issues . so we have to focus on those three thing three things . and in the end i 'll um show you our target audience or our target product users , customers . well , um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . project manager : marketing : that 's seventy five per cent of the current users . they do n't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . um they also say , that 's about uh i thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . so it 's very important that you design a a nice looking control . um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . so it 's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . furthermore , it 's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . industrial designer : you can zap away . yeah . marketing : yeah , yeah right . project manager : yeah . marketing : right . a lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : so it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that 's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . project manager : well user interface : yeah . marketing : i dunno , maybe that 's an idea . 'cause it 's uh a big i think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . industrial designer : oh ? project manager : it should actually uh it should actually be loose from the television , user interface : yeah . project manager : because it can also be used for other televisions . so if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . marketing : yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ? project manager : no you can click it on your television . marketing : yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? project manager : yeah in another room , yeah . industrial designer : project manager : well yes . marketing : nee but it it specifically says it 's uh the the control is lost in the same room . user interface : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : so well a beeping device would be project manager : well we 'll have a look at it , yeah . marketing : uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it 's it 's too uh too difficult to learn . so the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . user interface : industrial designer : i think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . uh marketing : yeah but people do n't read manuals . industrial designer : i did n't read it ? oh , alright . users to uh add one ? do you think ? user interface : i do n't think marketing : i think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . user interface : yeah . yes you should you should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it 's supposed to work . industrial designer : mm-hmm . yeah alright . because they do n't use it ? alright . project manager : well there sh should always be a menu , marketing : yeah . right . project manager : but it c can be very short . marketing : and it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . user interface : yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , i think . project manager : yes okay . industrial designer : well maybe for the if you do n't recognise a button who d who d who do i call uh wh when i do n't know it ? marketing : alright . user interface : yeah right . it sh it should be there , the manual . but but not to explain how the remote works . only marketing : and we do n't have much time . so it 's better to uh put our attention to the the design . so you can pick up and use it , than i think . project manager : well we are a design team , we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . industrial designer : is n't it part of the of the u marketing : yeah right , right . user interface : industrial designer : no . no . never mind . project manager : well we 'll have a look . um yes ? marketing : next point . um r_s_i_ . user interface : marketing : well that 's about twenty per cent i thought . but uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh wie zeg ik dat ? yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . industrial designer : consider the m yeah . marketing : it should be a good in your hand . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : right , this is the most important part . um , we 're like the requirements said , we 're gon na specify of we 're gon na target a younger audience . um , that 's about sixty per cent of the market , so it 's uh quite important . um research shows that they like to have a little lcd screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . uh i thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . project manager : well marketing : so it 's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . project manager : well with twelve euro fifty as production cost , we ca n't uh afford an lcd uh industrial designer : it 's going to be expensive . yeah . marketing : yeah but they think it 's really important . project manager : yeah . marketing : so if we want to s if we have a big if we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , i dunno . we have to uh project manager : well industrial designer : well we 'll uh consider it uh . project manager : yeah well uh it 's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh industrial designer : we 'll think abo we 'll think marketing : yeah , i do n't know . i do n't have any information on that . so project manager : nigh user interface : project manager : i know . industrial designer : no , we 'll look we 'll look into that later . alright ? marketing : right . and uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . they also like that , user interface : marketing : but research is very uh costly . so user interface : i think that 's uh difficult to realise also . marketing : yeah , but it it might be important for the sale . industrial designer : we have very demanding clients . project manager : it 's not yet a standard uh development uh those so user interface : no and we have customers in multiple uh countries i think . marketing : well i do think lcd is more reachable than the speech recognition . project manager : yeah absolutely . user interface : yeah . marketing : so we might consider lcd screens . user interface : no . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , alright . well we 'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , i think . we do n't rule them out uh yet . marketing : alright . project manager : 'kay . marketing : alright . um , i think that 's it . um project manager : alright . marketing : i think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . so you can right . project manager : well you i c i can uh still see your presentation ."
