    "answer": "grad g : that was hilarious . professor e : yeah . well , we should also check with mari again , because they because they were really intending , you know , maybe just did n't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level . so then that would double what we had . uh . and there 's a lot of different meetings at uw uh i mean really m a lot more { comment } than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus , grad g : right . phd a : is the uh , notion of recording any of chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ? professor e : uh , they seem to have some problems with it . we can we can talk about that later . um , but , again , jerry is jerry 's open so i mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting , uh jerry was open to it but i i s one of the things that i think is a little a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably ca n't do it every week . you know ? i i i i think that that people are gon na feel uh are gon na feel a little bit constrained . now , it might get a little better if we do n't have them do the digits all the time . and the then so then they can just really sort of try to put the mikes on and then just charge in and phd c : what if we give people you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ? postdoc b : well , you know , i i do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise . but i had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , i know that you do n't want artificial topics , phd c : alright , alright , alright . postdoc b : but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that would n't be too artificial . i mean , we could political discussions , or or something or other , phd c : no , definitely . postdoc b : and i you know , people who are because , you know , there 's also this constraint . we d it 's like , you know , the the uh goldibears goldi goldilocks , it 's like you do n't want meetings that are too large , but you do n't want meetings that are too small . and um a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word . phd a : well , even i mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about postdoc b : we could pay subjects . phd a : or what about people in the in the building ? phd c : yeah , i was thinking , there 's all these other peo phd a : i mean , there 's the state of california downstairs , and phd c : yeah . i mean grad g : i just really doubt that uh any of the state of california meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public . postdoc b : yeah . phd c : mm - hmm . grad g : so i i mean i talked with some people at the haas business school who are i who are interested in speech recognition phd c : alright , well . grad g : and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said `` well maybe we could have meetings down here `` , but then i got email from them that said `` no , we decided we 're not really interested and we do n't wan na come down and hold meetings . `` so , i think it 's gon na be a problem to get people regularly . phd a : what about joachim , maybe he can professor e : but but we c but i think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . and i i d i do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the with the radio . phd c : mm - hmm . professor e : uh i i have better contacts in radio than in television , but phd a : you could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones . phd c : well , and they 're already they 're these things are already recorded , professor e : yeah . phd c : we do n't have to ask them to even and i 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual professor e : n well no , i 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . i 'm talking about new ones phd c : why why not ? professor e : because because because we would be asking them to do something different . phd c : well , we can find out . i know for instance mark liberman was interested uh in in ldc getting data , uh , and professor e : right , that 's the found data idea . phd c : yeah . professor e : but what i 'm saying is uh if i talk to people that i know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike . phd c : mm - hmm . professor e : and u i think routinely they would not do this . so , since i 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , i wan na make sure that there is at least that somewhere phd c : right . great . ok . professor e : and uh but if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to the i might be able to talk them into it . phd c : mm - hmm . grad g : um . we 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here . phd c : that 's a good way to end a meeting . professor e : ok . well i do n't why do n't we why d u why do n't we uh uh turn them turn grad g : ok , leave leave them on for a moment until i turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time . postdoc b : oh . that 's good to know . professor e : turning off the microphone made it crash . well"
