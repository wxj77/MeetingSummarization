    "answer": "angela burns am : when you talk about structural change , are you referring to the fact that certain offshoots or divisions might close ? i bring this up because i 'm the assembly member for carmarthen west and south pembrokeshire , and i have had multiple representations from students , and their parents , who are about to go to lampeter and who 've been told that courses are being restructured , there 's a massive staff loss , and they have concerns about whether the three-year commitment they 're about to make to a course is going to be able to be sustained . so i am trying to drill down a little bit , because i think it 's only fair for the students to know what they 're up against , and also it 's a bit like in the great depression\u2014you can start a run on something , ca n't you ? because if enough people believe it , then suddenly enough people will stop going to what is an excellent little university , really top-quality in medieval literature , in archaeology . and i 'm just talking about one , but i know there are problems in other universities around wales , so i just wondered if you could comment on that and also what processes you as hefcw might have in place to protect any student who does find themselves in a situation where their course appears to be disappearing before their eyes . dr david blaney : so , there 's quite a lot in that question , actually . let me try not to forget any of the elements . first of all , your comment about causing a run is a serious consideration . so , if we look at the debate that happened in the senedd last week , from my reading of the transcript , it was actually quite a balanced debate where pretty much every contributor made reference to the contribution that higher education is making . there was reference to the national student survey scores , and in many ways wales is the best place in the uk to come and be a student , because you are looked after properly in wales . but there was also a perfectly legitimate exploration of whether or not there 's a crisis , and if you look at the way in which that was represented in the media , the crisis bit stuck and the rest of it did n't . at the point where the sector is trying very hard to recruit students , it 's really quite unhelpful that you get that sort of representation . so we do need to make sure , i think , all of us , that we try to avoid a situation where there can be media amplification of a problem that 's not actually as acute as the media are portraying it , and that is very harsh . i 'm not being critical of the political process here , but it has ripples and we do need to be careful that we do n't start a run on this . in terms of the specifics at lampeter , we understand that there are no plans to close any of the departments , and there certainly will not be plans to pull the rug out from under continuing students . that is just not what institutions do . so there 's an absolute obligation on them to meet their commitments , and that 's a contractual obligation anyway , so it 's a legal obligation . but we also have a quality machinery that we operate where we would expect institutions to be able to demonstrate that they 've put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that students can finish their programmes of study . so they 're not going to be recruiting students to programmes that they 're not planning to continue\u2014they just are not going to do that . and if you think about it in a market context , it would be suicidal for a university to treat their students like that . angela burns am : but i have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in trinity saint david 's financial plans ."
