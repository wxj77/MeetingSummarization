    "query": "<s> what did the meeting talk about to include more people in risk management ?",
    "answer": "dr david blaney : the machinery depends on having a body like hefcw doing some of that role , and the people who lend money to institutions are absolutely clear about that . so , we have relationships with the banks ; they come and see us every now and again\u2014typically not to talk about individual clients but just to talk about what we do and how we do it . interestingly , for example , when michael barber got up before christmas and said there will be no bail-outs of universities , we had banks on the phone to us within a couple of days , wanting just to talk about how it is in wales and is it still how it used to be . so , they are very keenly aware of what we do . so , it 's not really a governance failure ; it 's just that the machinery includes us . hefin david am : okay , that 's important . and one of the things , from a distance\u2014i mean , i 've been involved in different ways in an institution , and looking at the institutions from a distance . there are people , as you say , involved , and people always make the difference in different cultures . do you find that the relationships between executive teams and governors is effective , and are they sufficiently robust and challenging as well ? those executive permanent staff and the governors\u2014is there challenge there ? dr david blaney : i would say , in the main , yes . occasionally , we help the governors to ask the right questions , so occasionally that external perspective we 've just discussed is helpful in that regard . actually , there are times when there are tensions between the executive and governing bodies , inevitably\u2014that 's not something that 's remarkable\u2014and we can feel that as well . we have conversations with both governing bodies and executives . hefin david am : and that can become apparent from a public point of view as well\u2014you know , media reports and\u2014 ."
