    "answer": "grad b : what things to talk about . grad f : i 'm what ? really ? oh , that 's horrible ! disincentive ! grad a : ok , we 're recording . grad f : hello ? grad b : check check check check . grad d : uh , yeah . grad f : hello ? which am i ? professor c : oh right . grad b : alright . good . grad f : channel fi ok . ok . are you doing something ? ok , then i guess i 'm doing something . so , um , so basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met , um , but not as much writing , um , is a sheet that i have a lot of , like , thoughts and justification of comments on but i 'll just pass out as is right now . so , um , here . if you could pass this around ? and there 's two things . and so one on one side is on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification . grad d : um the wait . grad f : and the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism . grad e : this is just one sheet , right ? grad d : ah ! just one sheet . grad f : it 's just one sheet . it 's just a nothing else . grad d : front , back . grad f : um , enough to go around ? ok . and in some ways it 's it 's it 's very similar to there are very few changes in some ways from what we 've , um , uh , b done before but i do n't think everyone here has seen all of this . so , uh , i 'm not sure where to begin . um , as usual the disclaimers are there are all these things are it 's only slightly more stable than it was before . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : and , um , after a little bit more discussion and especially like keith and i i have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more . grad e : yeah . grad f : um , maybe i will let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , um , because that 's , i 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um to people . ok , so the top block is just sort of a sort of abstract nota it 's sort of like , um , listings of the kinds of things that we can have . and certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . there there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth . but basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name . i forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line . professor c : what i was gon na right . grad f : so something like , um well , there 's an example the textual example at the end has clausal construction . so , um , just to show it does n't have to be beautiful it could be , you know , simple old text as well . um , there are a couple of uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things . so i 'll just try to go through them . so they could all have a type at the beginning . um , and then they say the key word construction professor c : oh , i see . grad f : and they have some name . professor c : so so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct grad f : yeah , right . professor c : ok , that 's fine . grad f : ok , and then it has a block that is constituents . and as usual i guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk { comment } one type of constituent , that is a constructional constituent . i think that 's actually gon na turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . but in general instead of the word `` construct `` , th here you might have `` meaning `` or `` form `` as well . ok ? so if there 's some element that does n't that is n't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning . ok , um , the main change with the constructs which each of which has , um , the key word `` construct `` and then some name , and then some type specification , is that it 's it 's pro it 's often sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . so for example whatever i have here is gon na be a form of the word `` throw `` , or it 's gon na be a form of the word , you know , i do n't know , `` happy `` , or something like that . or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word or maybe you 'll have the type . you 'll say `` i need a p uh spatial relation phrase here `` or `` i need a directional specifier here `` . so - uh you could have a j a actual type here . um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . so a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , often a human . right ? so if i you know , the um , uh , run down the street then i i i run down the street , it 's typed , uh , `` i `` , meaning category is what 's there . the the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair and , um , sort of skipping fonts and whatever . the idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . it 's it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : and usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it . professor c : mm - hmm . grad f : and then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about , about what meaning what specific meaning you want . so the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion , you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , `` the big th `` , you you know , `` the big the tall dark man `` , you know , `` walked into the room `` . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : but because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate nominal , and which will apply just as well to like , you know , a per you know , a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression . um , so i do n't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . so . ok , then i do n't think the , { comment } um at least yeah . { comment } none of these examples have anything different for formal constraints ? but you can refer to any of the , um , sort of available elements and scope , right ? which here are the constructs , { comment } to say something about the relation . and i think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block , um , we dropped like the little f subscript . the f subscripts refer to the `` form `` piece of the construct . professor c : good . grad f : and i think that , um , in general it 'll be unambiguous . like if you were giving a formal constraint then you 're referring to the formal pole of that . so so by saying if i just said `` name one `` then that means name one formal and we 're talking about formal struc { comment } which which makes sense . uh , there are certain times when we 'll have an exception to that , in which case you could just indicate `` here i mean the meaningful for some reason `` . right ? or actually it 's more often that , only to handle this one special case of , you know , `` george and jerry walk into the room in that order `` . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : so we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form . but but s we 're not gon na really worry about that for right now and there are way we can be more specific if we have to later on . ok , and so in terms of the the relations , you know , as usual they 're before and ends . i should have put an example in of something that is n't an interval relation but in form you might also have a value binding . you know , you could say that , um , you know , `` name - one dot `` , t you know , `` number equals `` , you know , a plural or something like that . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : there are certain things that are attribute - value , similar to the bindings below but i mean they 're just us usually they 're going to be value value fillers , right ? ok , and then again semantic constraints here are just are just bindings . there was talk of changing the name of that . and johno and i i you you and i can like fight about that if you like ? but about changing it to `` semantic n effects `` , which i thought was a little bit too order - biased grad b : well th grad f : and `` semantic bindings `` , which i thought might be too restrictive in case we do n't have only bindings . and so it was an issue whether constraints um , there were some linguists who reacted against `` constraints `` , saying , `` oh , if it 's not used for matching , then it should n't be called a constraint `` . but i think we want to be uncommitted about whether it 's used for matching or not . right ? cuz there are i think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the c bindings are , for actual , you know , sort of like modified constraining purposes . professor c : well , you definitely want to de - couple the formalism from the parsing strategy . so that whether or not it 's used for matching or only for verification , i grad e : yeah . grad f : yeah , yeah . it 's used should n't matter , right ? mm - hmm . professor c : s for sure . i mean , i do n't know what , uh , term we want to use grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : but we do n't want to grad f : yeah , uh , there was one time when when hans explained why `` constraints `` was a misleading word for him . and i think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why johno thought it was a misleading term , which was just an interesting coincidence . um , but , uh and so i was like , `` ok , well both of you do n't like it ? professor c : it 's g it 's gone . grad f : fine , we can change it `` . but i i i 'm starting to like it again . grad b : but grad f : so that that 's why { comment } that 's why i 'll stick with it . grad a : well , you know what ? grad f : so grad a : if you have an `` if - then `` phrase , do you know what the `` then `` phrase is called ? grad f : what ? con - uh , a consequent ? grad a : yeah . grad f : yeah , but it 's not an `` if - then `` . grad a : no , but professor c : i know . anyway , so the other the other strategy you guys could consider is when you do n't know what word to put , you could put no word , grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : just meaning . ok ? and the then let grad e : yeah . grad f : yeah , that 's true . grad b : so that 's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down down here ? grad f : oh , oops ! no . that was just a mistake of cut and paste from when i was going with it . so , i 'm sorry . i did n't mean that one 's an in unintentional . grad b : so this should be semantic and grad f : sometimes i 'm intentionally inconsistent cuz i 'm not sure yet . here , i actually it was just a mistake . grad b : th - so this definitely should be `` semantic constraints `` down at the bottom ? grad e : sure . grad f : yeah . well , unless i go with `` meaning `` but i i mean , i kind of like `` meaning `` better than `` semantic `` grad b : or professor c : oh , whatever . grad f : but i think there 's vestiges of other people 's biases . professor c : or wh that - b grad f : like professor c : right . minor min problem grad f : minor point . grad e : extremely . grad f : ok , um , so i think the middle block does n't really give you any more information , ex than the top block . and the bottom block similarly only just illus you know , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and and that you can drop the , um uh , that you can give dual types . oh , one thing i should mention is about `` designates `` . i think i 'm actually inconsistent across these as well . so , um , strike out the m subscript on the middle block . professor c : mm - hmm . grad f : so basically now , um , this is actually this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change , which is that `` designates `` is n't only something for the semantics to worry about now . professor c : good . grad f : so we want s `` designates `` to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on . so for instance , if some other construction says , you know , `` are you of type is this part of type whatever `` , um , the `` designates `` tells you which sort of part is the meaning part . ok , so if you have like `` the big red ball `` , you know , you wan na know if there 's an object or a noun . well , ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase . um , there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it 's useful sometimes to talk about , um to talk about there also being a designated object and we think that that 'll be the same one , right ? so the ball is the head of the phrase , `` the r the `` , um , `` big red ball `` , and the entity denoted by the word `` ball `` is sort of the semantic head in some ways of of this sort of , um , in interesting larger element . professor c : a a and the yeah . and there 's uh there 's ca some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head . and and this enables you to get that , if i understand you right . grad e : yeah . grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : yeah . grad f : right , right . grad e : that 's the idea . professor c : yeah yeah . grad e : yeah . grad f : and , uh , you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head - final language , you can refer to the head as a p the , you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision . professor c : right . grad f : so that 's a useful thing so that you can get some internal structural constraints in . professor c : ok , so that all looks good . let me oh , w oh . i do n't know . were you finished ? grad f : um , there was a list of things that is n't included but you you can you can ask a question . that might @ @ it . professor c : ok . so , i if i understand this the aside from , uh , construed and all that sort of stuff , the the differences are mainly that , we 've gone to the possibility of having form - meaning pairs for a type grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : or actually gone back to , grad f : right . professor c : if we go back far enough grad f : well , except for their construction meaning , so it 's not clear that , uh well , right now it 's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type . so i do n't know what a form type is . professor c : oh , i see . yeah , yeah , yeah . i 'm sorry , you 're right . grad f : yeah . professor c : a construction type . uh , that 's fine . but it , um grad f : right . a well , and a previous , um , you know , version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it . so you could say `` construct of type whatever designates something `` . professor c : yeah . grad f : but that was mostly for reference purposes , just to refer to the meaning pole . i do n't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning , which is really what we want most of the time i think . professor c : mm - hmm . grad f : um , i i do n't know if we 'll ever have a case where we actually h if there is a form category constraint , you could imagine having a triple there that says , you know that 's kind of weird . professor c : no , no , no , i do n't think so . i think that you 'll you 'll do fine . grad e : i professor c : in fact , these are , um , as long as as mark is n't around , these are form constraints . so a nominal expression is uh , the fact that it 's animate , is semantic . the fact that it 's n uh , a nominal expression i would say on most people 's notion of of f you know , higher form types , this i this is one . grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : yeah . grad f : right , right . professor c : and i think that 's just fine . grad e : yeah , yeah . grad f : which is fine , yeah . professor c : yeah . grad e : it 's that now , um , i 'm mentioned this , i i do n't know if i ever explained this but the point of , um , i mentioned in the last meeting , { comment } the point of having something called `` nominal expression `` is , um , because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for , you know , like say taking as its object just some expression which , um , designates an object or designates a thing , or whatever , um , that leads to some syntactic problems basically ? so you wan na , you know you sort of have this problem like `` ok , well , i 'll put the word `` , uh , let 's say , the word `` dog `` , you know . and that has to come right after the verb grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : cuz we know verb meets its object . and then we have a construction that says , oh , you can have `` the `` preceding a noun . and so you 'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet the designatum . professor c : right . grad e : and you could get , you know , `` the kicked dog `` or something like that , meaning `` kicked the dog `` . professor c : right . grad e : um , so you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there professor c : that i i have no problem with it at all . grad e : but it - it professor c : i think it 's fine . grad e : yeah . grad f : yeah . right , n s you may be you may not be like everyone else in in berkeley , grad e : yeah . yeah . grad f : but that 's ok . grad e : i mean , we we we sort of thought we were getting away with , uh with , a p grad f : uh , we do n't mind either , so grad e : i mean , this is not reverting to the x - bar theory of of phrase structure . professor c : right . grad e : but , uh , grad f : right . grad e : i just know that this is like , we did n't originally have in mind that , uh that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form . grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : but they do . grad e : um , but they does . grad f : well , there 's an alternative to this grad e : at least in english . grad f : which is , um the question was did we want directed motion , professor c : yeah . grad f : which is an argument structure construction professor c : mm - hmm . grad e : yeah . grad f : did we want it to worry about , um , anything more than the fact that it , you know , has semantic you know , it 's sort of frame - based construction . so one option that , you know , keith had mentioned also was like , well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject , predicate , basically things like grammatical relations , grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : those could intersect with these in such a way that subject , predicate , or subject , predicate , subject , verb , ob you know , verb object would require that those things that f fill a subject and object are nom expressions . professor c : right . grad f : and that would be a little bit cleaner in some way . but you know , for now , i mean , professor c : yeah . but it y y it 's yeah , just moving it moving the c the cons the constraints around . grad f : uh , you know . m moving it to another place , right . grad e : yeah . professor c : ok , so that 's grad f : but there does basically , the point is there has to be that constraint somewhere , right ? professor c : right . grad f : so , yeah . professor c : and so that was the grad f : robert 's not happy now ? oh , ok . professor c : ok , and sort of going with that is that the designatum also now is a pair . instead of just the meaning . grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : and that aside from some terminology , that 's basically it . grad f : right . professor c : i just want to b i 'm i 'm asking . grad e : mm - hmm . yeah . grad f : yeah , um , the un sort of the un - addressed questions in this , um , definitely would for instance be semantic constraints we talked about . professor c : yeah . grad f : here are just bindings but , right ? we might want to introduce mental spaces you know , there 's all these things that we do n't professor c : the whole the mental space thing is clearly not here . grad f : right ? so there 's going to be some extra you know , definitely other notation we 'll need for that which we skip for now . grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : by the way , i do want to get on that as soon as robert gets back . grad f : uh yeah . professor c : so , uh , the the mental space thing . um , obviously , construal is a b is a b is a big component of that grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : so this probably not worth trying to do anything till he gets back . but sort of as soon as he gets back i think um , we ought to grad f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad e : so what 's the what 's the time frame ? i forgot again when you 're going away for how long ? grad a : just , uh , as a sort of a mental bridge , i 'm not i 'm skipping fourth of july . so , uh , right afterwards i 'm back . grad e : ok . ok . grad f : what ? you 're missing like the premier american holiday ? what 's the point of spending a year here ? grad a : uh , i 've had it often enough . grad f : so , anyway . grad b : well he w he went to college here . grad f : oh , yeah , i forgot . oops . { comment } sorry . professor c : yeah . and furthermore it 's well worth missing . grad f : not in california . yeah , that 's true . i like i i like spending fourth of july in other countries , whenever i can . professor c : right . grad f : um professor c : ok , so that 's great . grad f : construal , ok , so oh , so there was one question that came out . i hate this thing . sorry . um , which is , so something like `` past `` which i you know , we think is a very simple uh , we 've often just stuck it in as a feature , professor c : right . right . grad f : you know , `` oh , this event takes place before speech time `` , { comment } ok , is what this means . um , it 's often thought of as it is also considered a mental space , professor c : right . grad f : you know , by , you know , lots of people around here . professor c : right . grad f : so there 's this issue of well sometimes there are really exotic explicit space builders that say `` in france , blah - blah - blah `` , grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : and you have to build up you ha you would imagine that would require you , you know , to be very specific about the machinery , whereas past is a very conventionalized one and we sort of know what it means but it we does n't do n't necessarily want to , you know , unload all the notation every time we see that it 's past tense . professor c : right . grad f : so , you know , we could think of our uh , just like x - schema `` walk `` refers to this complicated structure , past refers to , you know , a certain configuration of this thing with respect to it . professor c : i think that 's exactly right . grad f : so so we 're kind of like having our cake and eating it professor c : yeah . grad f : you know , having it both ways , right ? professor c : yeah . no , i think i think that i we 'll have to see how it works out when we do the details grad f : so , i i mm - hmm . professor c : but my intuition would be that that 's right . grad f : mm - hmm . yeah , ok . grad a : do you want to do the same for space ? grad f : wha - sorry ? grad a : space ? grad f : space ? grad a : here ? now ? grad f : oh , oh , oh , oh , instead of just time ? grad a : mm - hmm . grad f : yeah , yeah , yeah . same thing . so there are very conventionalized like deictic ones , right ? and then i think for other spaces that you introduce , you could just attach y whatever you could build up an appropriately uh , appropriate structure according to the l the sentence . professor c : yeah . grad a : hmm , well this this basically would involve everything you can imagine to fit under your c dot something you know , where where it 's contextually dependent , grad f : yeah . right . grad a : `` what is now , what was past , grad f : mm - hmm . grad a : what is in the future , where is this , what is here , what is there , what is `` grad f : mm - hmm . yeah . so time and space . um , we 'll we 'll get that on the other side a little , like very minimally . there 's a sort of there 's a slot for setting time and setting place . professor c : good . grad f : and you know , you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place , and then there are many in more interestingly , linguistically anyway , { comment } there are relative things that , you know , you relate the event in time and space to where you are now . if there 's something a lot more complicated like , or so hypothetical or whatever , then you have to do your job , grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : like or somebody 's job anyway . grad e : yeah . grad f : i 'm gon na point to at random . grad e : yeah . i mean , i 'm i 'm s curious about how much of the mental i mean , i 'm not sure that the formalism , sort of the grammatical side of things , { comment } is gon na have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff . you know , um , basically all of these so - called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of i think of it as , sort of giving you the coordinates of , you know assuming that at any point in discourse there 's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios , whatever , and the speaker 's supposed to be keeping track of those . the , um the construction that you actually get is just gon na sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going , um , you 're supposed to add structure to . grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : so `` in france , uh , watergate would n't have hurt nixon `` or something like that . um , well , you say , `` alright , i 'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past france universe `` or something like that . the information in the sentence tells you that much but it does n't tell you like exactly what it what the point of doing so is . so for example , depending on the linguistic con uh , context it could be like the question is for example , what does `` watergate `` refer to there ? does it , you know does it refer to , um if you just hear that sentence cold , the assumption is that when you say `` watergate `` you 're referring to `` a watergate - like scandal as we might imagine it happening in france `` . but in a different context , `` oh , you know , if nixon had apologized right away it would n't you know , watergate would n't have hurt him so badly in the us and in france it would n't have hurt him at all `` . now we 're s now that `` watergate `` we 're now talking about the real one , grad f : they 're real , right . grad e : and the `` would `` sort of it 's a sort of different dimension of hypothe - theticality , right ? we 're not saying what 's hypothetical about this world . grad f : i see right . grad e : in the first case , hypothetically we 're imagining that watergate happened in france . in the second case we 're imagining hypothetically that nixon had apologized right away grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : or something . right ? grad f : right . grad e : so a lot of this is n't happening at the grammatical level . professor c : correct . grad e : uh , um , and so grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : i do n't know where that sits then , sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant . grad f : it seems like , um , the grammatical things such as the auxiliaries that you know introduce these conditionals , whatever , give you sort of the the most basi grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : th those we i think we can figure out what the possibilities are , right ? grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : there are sort of a relatively limited number . and then how they interact with some extra thing like `` in france `` or `` if such - and - such `` , that 's like there are certain ways that they c they can grad e : yeah . grad f : you know , one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammat grammar gives you . grad e : yeah . grad f : i think . but , you know , whatever , professor c : yeah , in the short run all we need is a enough mechanism on the form side to get things going . grad f : we we 're grad e : mm - hmm . yeah . professor c : uh , i uh , you you grad e : but the whole point of the whole point of what fauconnier and turner have to say about , uh , mental spaces , and blending , and all that stuff is that you do n't really get that much out of the sentence . you know , there 's not that much information contained in the sentence . it just says , `` here . add this structure to this space . `` and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open . an individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on , quote , `` what the space configuration is at the time of utterance `` . grad f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad e : and so somebody 's gon na have to be doing a whole lot of work but not me , i think . professor c : well i think that 's right . oh , i yeah , i , uh , uh i think that 's not k i th i do n't think it 's completely right . i mean , in fact a sentence examples you gave in f did constrain the meaning b the form did constrain the meaning , grad e : yeah . professor c : and so , um , it is n't , uh grad e : sure , but like what what was the point of saying that sentence about nixon and france ? that is not there is nothing about that in the in the sentence really . grad f : that 's ok . we usually do n't know the point of the sentence at all . grad e : yeah . grad f : but we know what it 's trying to say . professor c : yeah . grad e : y yeah . grad f : we we know that it 's what predication it 's setting up . professor c : but but bottom line , i agree with you , grad e : yeah . grad f : that 's all . professor c : that that that we 're not expecting much out of the , uh f grad e : yeah . grad f : purely linguistic cues , right ? professor c : uh , the purely form cues , yeah . and , um i mean , you 're you 're the linguist but , uh , it seems to me that th these we we you know , we 've talked about maybe a half a dozen linguistics theses in the last few minutes or something . grad e : yeah , yeah . professor c : yeah , i mean grad e : yeah . oh , yeah . professor c : uh , i i mean , that that 's my feeling that that these are really hard uh , problems that decide exactly what what 's going on . grad e : mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . grad f : ok , so , um , one other thing i just want to point out is there 's a lot of confusion about the terms like `` profile , designate , focus `` , et cetera , et cetera . professor c : uh , right , right , right . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : um , for now i 'm gon na say like `` profile `` 's often used like two uses that come to mind immediately . one is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else . so `` hypotenuse `` , you profiled this guy against the background of the right t right triangle . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : ok . and the second use , um , is in framenet . it 's slightly different . oh , i was asking hans about this . they use it to really mean , um , this in a frame th this is the profiles on the these are the ones that are required . so they have to be there or expressed in some way . which which i 'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive but they 're they 're different meanings . professor c : right . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : so the closest thing so i was thinking about how it relates to this notation . for us , um ok , so how is it professor c : does that is that really what they mean in in grad f : so `` designate `` framenet ? professor c : i did n't know that . grad f : framenet ? yeah , yeah . i i mean , i i was a little bit surprised about it too . professor c : yeah . grad f : i knew that i thought that that would be something like there 's another term that i 've heard for that thing professor c : right , ok . grad f : but they i mean uh , well , at least hans says they use it that way . and professor c : well , i 'll check . grad f : and may maybe he 's wrong . anyway , so i think the the `` designate `` that we have in terms of meaning is really the `` highlight this thing with respect to everything else `` . ok ? professor c : right . grad f : so this is what what it means . but the second one seems to be useful but we might not need a notation for it ? we do n't have a notation for it but we might want one . so for example we 've talked about if you 're talking about the lexical item `` walk `` , you know it 's an action . well , it also has this idea it carries along with it the idea of an actor or somebody 's gon na do the walking . or if you talk about an adjective `` red `` , it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red . so we used to use the notation `` with `` for this professor c : right . grad f : and i think that 's closest to their second one . so i d do n't yet know , i have no commitment , as to whether we need it . it might be it 's the kind of thing that w a parser might want to think about whether we require you know , these things are like it 's semantically part of it professor c : n no , no . well , uh , th critically they 're not required syntactically . often they 're pres presu presupposed and all that sort of stuff . grad f : right . right , right . yeah , um , definitely . so , um , `` in `` was a good example . if you walk `` in `` , like well , in what ? professor c : right , there 's grad f : you know , like you have to have the { comment } so so it 's only semantically is it it is still required , say , by simulation time though professor c : right . grad f : to have something . so it 's that i meant the idea of like that the semantic value is filled in by sim simulation . i do n't know if that 's something we need to spa to to like say ever as part of the requirement ? or the construction ? or not . we 'll we 'll again defer . professor c : or i mean , or or , uh so the grad f : have it construed , professor c : yeah , yeah . grad f : is that the idea ? just point at robert . whenever i 'm confused just point to him . professor c : right . it 's it 's his thesis , right ? grad f : you tell me . professor c : anyway , right , yeah , w this is gon na be a b you 're right , this is a bit of in a mess and we still have emphasis as well , or stress , or whatever . grad f : ok , well we 'll get , uh uh , i we have thoughts about those as well . professor c : yeah . great . grad f : um , the i w i would just s some of this is just like my you know , by fiat . i 'm going to say , this is how we use these terms . i do n't - you know , there 's lots of different ways in the world that people use it . professor c : i that 's fine . grad e : yeah . grad f : i think that , um , the other terms that are related are like focus and stress . professor c : mm - hmm . grad f : so , s i think that the way i we would like to think , uh , i think is focus is something that comes up in , i mean , lots of basically this is the information structure . professor c : mm - hmm . grad f : ok , it 's like uh , it 's not it might be that there 's a syntactic , uh , device that you use to indicate focus or that there are things like , you know , i think keith was telling me , { comment } things toward the end of the sentence , post - verbal , tend to be the focused focused element , the new information . you know , if i `` i walked into the room `` , you tend to think that , whatever , `` into the room `` is sort of like the more focused kind of thing . grad e : mm - hmm . yeah . grad f : and when you , uh , uh , you have stress on something that might be , you know , a cue that the stressed element , or for instance , the negated element is kind of related to information structure . so that 's like the new the sort of like import or whatever of of this thing . uh , so so i think that 's kind of nice to keep `` focus `` being an information structure term . `` stress `` i th and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it . so , um , like `` stress `` , th stress is kind of a pun on you might have like whatever , like , um , accent kind of stress . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : and that 's just a uh , w we 'll want to distinguish stress as a form device . you know , like , oh , high volume or whatever . grad e : yeah . grad f : um , t uh , and distinguish that from it 's effect which is , `` oh , the kind of focus we have is we 're emphasizing this value often as opposed to other values `` , right ? so focus carries along a scope . like if you 're gon na focus on this thing and you wan na know it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it was n't . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : um , so my classic my now - classic example of saying , `` oh , he did go to the meeting ? `` , grad e : yeah . grad f : that was my way of saying as opposed to , you know , `` oh , he did n't g `` or `` there was a meeting ? `` grad e : yeah . grad f : i think that was the example that was caught on by the linguists immediately . grad e : yeah . grad f : and so , um , the like if you said he you know , there 's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you 're , c focusing , whatever , on , uh grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : `` he walked to the meeting `` as opposed to `` he ran `` , or `` he did walk to the meeting `` as opposed to `` he did n't walk `` . you know , grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : so we need to have a notation for that which , um , i think that 's still in progress . so , sort of i 'm still working it out . but it did one one implication it does f have for the other side , which we 'll get to in a minute is that i could n't think of a good way to say `` here are the possible things that you could focus on `` , cuz it seems like any entity in any sentence , you know , or any meaning component of anyth you know all the possible meanings you could have , any of them could be the subject of focus . but i think one the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus , right ? so for instance , you could say it 's the the tense on this as opposed to , um , the the action . ok . or it 's uh , it 's an identity thing or a contrast with other things , or stress this value as opposed to other things . so , um , it 's it is kind of like a profile profile - background thing but i i ca n't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you would that you would focu grad e : light up with focus , yeah . grad f : light highlight as opposed to other ones . so it has some certain complications for the , uh , uh later on . li - i mean , uh , the best thing i can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements . for instance , you oh , one other type that i forgot to mention is like query elements and that 's probably relevant for the like `` where is `` , you know , `` the castle `` kind of thing ? grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : because you might want to say that , um , location or cert certain wh words bring you know , sort of automatically focus in a , you know , `` i do n't know the identity of this thing `` kind of way on certain elements . so . ok . anyway . so that 's onl there are there are many more things that are uncl that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation but it 's most i think it 's this is , you know , the current current form . other things we did n't totally deal with , um , grad e : oh , there 's a bunch . grad f : well , we 've had a lot of other stuff that keith and i have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective . grad e : yeah . grad f : you know , a a nominal expression . grad e : yeah . grad f : and , um , i mean , we should have put an example of this and we could do that later . grad e : yeah . grad f : but i think the not inherently like the general principles still work though , that , um , we can have constructions that have sort of constituent structure in that there is like , you know , for instance , one uh , you know , they they have constituents , right ? so you can like nest things when you need to , but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way . so if you do n't have like a lot of grammar experience , then like this this might , you know , be a little o opaque . but , you know , we have the properties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituents constituent - based grammar . so that 's i think that 's sort of the main thing we wanted to aim for grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : and so far it 's worked out ok . professor c : good . grad f : so . ok . grad a : i can say two things about the f maybe you want to forget stress . this my f grad f : as a word ? grad a : no , as as just do n't do n't think about it . grad f : as a what 's that ? grad a : if grad f : sorry . grad a : canonically speaking you can if you look at a a curve over sentence , you can find out where a certain stress is and say , `` hey , that 's my focus exponent . `` grad e : right . grad f : mm - hmm . grad a : it does n't tell you anything what the focus is . if it 's just that thing , grad f : mm - hmm . or the constituent that it falls in . grad a : a little bit more or the whole phrase . grad e : mm - hmm . grad a : um grad f : you mean t forget about stress , the form cue ? grad a : the form bit grad e : yeah . grad a : because , uh , as a form cue , um , not even trained experts can always well , they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes . and that 's also mostly true for read speech . in in real speech , um , people may put stress . it 's so d context dependent on what was there before , phrase ba breaks , um , restarts . grad f : yeah . mm - hmm . grad a : it 's just , um it 's absurd . it 's complicated . and all grad e : yeah , i mean , i i 'm sort of inclined to say let 's worry about specifying the information structure focus of the sentence grad f : i believe you , yeah . grad e : and then , grad f : mm - hmm . ways that you can get it come from th grad e : hhh , { comment } the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that . grad f : right . grad e : you know , i mean , later on we 'll worry about exactly how grad a : or or map from the contour to to what the focus exponent is . grad e : y yeah . exactly . grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : but figure out how the grad a : but , uh , if you do n't know what you 're what you 're focus is then you 're you 're hopeless - uh - ly lost anyways , grad e : yeah . grad f : right . that 's fine , yeah . mm - hmm . grad a : and the only way of figuring out what that is , is , um , by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element , decide which one in that context makes sense and which one does n't . grad f : mm - hmm . grad a : and then you 're left with a couple three . so , you know , again , that 's something that h humans can do , grad f : mm - hmm . grad a : um , but far outside the scope of of any anything . so . you know . it 's grad f : ok . well , uh , yeah , i would n't have assumed that it 's an easy problem in in absence of all the oth you need all the other information i guess . grad a : but it 's it 's what it uh , it 's pretty easy to put it in the formalism , though . i mean , because grad f : yeah . grad a : you can just say whatever stuff , `` i is the container being focused or the the entire whatever , both , and so forth . `` grad f : mm - hmm , mm - hmm . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : yeah . exactly . so the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture . professor c : yeah , so b b but i think the poi i 'm not sure i understand but here 's what i th think is going on . that if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches , it the fact that it matches , does in fact specify the focus . grad f : w uh , i 'm not sure about that . or it might limit it cert certainly constrains the possibilities of focus . professor c : uh k uh , at at the very least it constrai grad f : i think that 's that 's , th that 's certainly true . and depending on the construction it may or may not f specify the focus , right ? professor c : oh , uh , for sure , yes . there are constrai yeah , it 's not every but there are constructions , uh , where you t explicitly take into account those considerations grad f : yeah . mm - hmm . professor c : that you need to take into account in order to decide which what is being focused . grad f : mm - hmm . grad a : mm - hmm . so we talked about that a little bit this morning . `` john is on the bus , not nancy . `` grad f : mm - hmm . grad a : so that 's focuses on john . professor c : right . grad a : `` john is on the bus and not on the train . `` grad f : mm - hmm . grad a : `` john is on the bus `` versus `` john is on the train . `` professor c : right . grad f : right . grad a : and `` john is on the bus `` versus `` was `` , and e grad f : is on . `` john is on the bus `` . yeah . yeah . grad a : `` it 's the bu `` so e professor c : right . yeah , all all of those . grad a : all of these professor c : yeah . grad f : right . grad a : and will we have u is it all the same constructions ? just with a different foc focus constituent ? grad f : yeah , i would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like sort of , grad a : mm - hmm . grad f : i do n't know the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some whatever is predicated anyway should be the same set of constructions . so that 's why i was talking about overlapping constructions . so , then you have a separate thing that picks out , you know , stress on something relative to everything else . professor c : yeah . so , the question is actually grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : oh , i 'm sorry , grad f : and it would professor c : go ahead , grad f : yeah , professor c : finish . grad f : and it w and that would have to uh it might be ambiguous as , uh , whether it picks up that element , or the phrase , or something like that . but it 's still is limited possibility . so that should , you know , interact with it should overlap with whatever other construction is there . grad a : yeah . professor c : s s the question is , do we have a way on the other page , uh , when we get to the s semantic side , of saying what the stressed element was , or stressed phrase , or something . grad f : mm - hmm . well , so that 's why i was saying how since i could n't think of an easy like limited way of doing it , um , all i can say is that information structure has a focused slot professor c : right . grad f : and i think that should be able to refer to professor c : so that 's down at the bottom here when we get over there . ok . grad f : yeah , and , infer and i do n't have i do n't have a great way or great examples professor c : i 'll - i 'll wait . ok . grad f : but i think that something like that is probably gon na be , uh , more more what we have to do . but , um , ok , that was one comment . and you had another one ? grad a : yeah , well the once you know what the focus is the everything else is background . how about `` topic - comment `` that 's the other side of information . grad f : how about what ? grad a : topic - comment . grad f : yeah , so that was the other thing . and so i did n't realize it before . it 's like , `` oh ! `` it was an epiphany that it you know , topic and focus are a contrast set . so topic is topic - focused seems to me like , um , background profile , ok , or a landmark trajector , or some something like that . there 's there 's definitely , um , that kind of thing going on . now i do n't know whether i n i do n't have as many great examples of like topic - indicating constructions on like focus , right ? um , topic it seems kind of you know , i think that might be an ongoing kind of thing . grad a : mm - hmm . grad e : japanese has this though . you know . grad f : topic marker ? grad a : yeah . grad e : yeah , that 's what `` wa `` is , uh , just to mark which thing is the topic . grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : it does n't always have to be the subject . grad f : mm - hmm . right . so again , information structure has a topic slot . and , you know , i stuck it in thinking that we might use it . grad a : mm - hmm . grad f : um , i think i stuck it in . professor c : yep , it 's there . grad f : um , and one thing that i did n't do consistently , um , is when we get there , is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role . i think i have an idea of what it should be but th you know , so far we 've been getting away with like either a type constraint or , um , you know , whatever . i forg it 'll be a frame . you know , it 'll be it 'll be another predication or it 'll be , um , i do n't know , some value from from some something , some variable and scope or something like that , or a slot chain based on a variable and scope . ok , so well that 's should we flip over to the other side officially then ? grad a : mm - hmm , hmm . grad e : ok , side one . grad f : i keep , uh , like , pointing forward to it . yeah . now we 'll go back to s ok , so this does n't include something which mi mi may have some effect on on it , which is , um , the discourse situation context record , right ? so i did n't i i meant just like draw a line and like , you know , you also have , uh , some tracking of what was going on . professor c : right . grad f : and sort of this is a big scale comment before i , you know , look into the details of this . but for instance you could imagine instead of having i i changed the name of um it used to be `` entities `` . so you see it 's `` scenario `` , `` referent `` and `` discourse segment `` . and `` scenario `` is essentially what kind of what 's the basic predication , what event happened . and actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ? um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : you know , specific x - schema frames . ok , whatever . the middle thing used to be `` entities `` because you could imagine it should be like really a list where here was various information . and this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about . so `` harry walked into the room `` , `` harry `` and `` room `` , you know , the room th but they would be represented in this list somehow . and it could also have for instance , it has this category slot . um , it should be either category or in or instance . basically , it could be a pointer to ontology . so that everything you know about this could be could be drawn in . but the important things for grammatical purposes are for things like number , gender , um ki the ones i included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth if it 's a group whether , um , some event is happening , linear time , linear spaces , like , you know , are are they doing something serially or is it like , um , uh i 'm i 'm not sure . because this partly came from , uh , talmy 's schema and i 'm not sure we 'll need all of these actually . but um , and then the `` status `` i used was like , again , in some languages , you know , like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status . so , th the the big com and and finally `` discourse segment `` is about sort of speech - act - y information structure - y , like utterance - specific kinds of things . so the comment i was going to make about , um , changing entity the entity 's block to reference is that you can imagine your discourse like situation context , you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to . and you might that might be sort of a general , i do n't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to . and i changed to `` reference `` cuz i would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it . and those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here . for instance , i know it 's going to be plural . i know it 's gon na be feminine or something like that . and and these could actually just point to , you know , the the id in my other list of enti active entities , right ? so , um , uh , th there 's there 's all this stuff about discourse status . we 've talked about . i almost listed `` discourse status `` as a slot where you could say it 's active . you know , there 's this , um , hierarchy uh there 's a schematization of , you know , things can be active or they can be , um , accessible , inaccessible . grad e : yeah . grad f : it was the one that , you know , keith , um , emailed to us once , to some of us , not all of us . and the thing is that that i noticed that that , um , list was sort of discourse dependent . it was like in this particular set , s you know , instance , it has been referred to recently or it has n't been , grad e : yeah . grad f : or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active . professor c : this uh yeah , well there there seems to be context properties . yeah . grad f : yeah , they 're contex and for instance , i used to have a location thing there but actually that 's a property of the situation . and it 's again , time , you know at cert certain points things are located , you know , near or far from you professor c : well , uh , uh , this is recursive grad f : and professor c : cuz until we do the uh , mental space story , we 're not quite sure { comment } th - th grad f : yeah . professor c : which is fine . we 'll just we 'll j grad f : yeah , yeah . so some of these are , uh professor c : we just do n't know yet . grad f : right . so i so for now i thought , well maybe i 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance , right ? everything else here is utterance - specific . um , and i left the slot , `` predications `` , open because you can have , um , things like `` the guy i know from school `` . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make . and it 's unclear whether i mean , you could just have in your scenario , `` here are some extra few things that are true `` , right ? grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : and then you could just sort of not have this slot here . right ? you 're but but it 's used for identification purposes . professor c : right . grad e : yeah . grad f : so it 's it 's a little bit different from just saying `` all these things are true from my utterance `` . grad e : yeah . right , `` this guy i know from school came for dinner `` does not mean , um , `` there 's a guy , i know him from school , and he came over for dinner `` . that 's not the same effect . grad f : yeah , it 's a little bit it 's a little bit different . right ? so or maybe that 's like a restrictive , non - restrictive grad e : yeah . grad f : you know , it 's like it gets into that kind of thing for um , but maybe i 'm mixing , you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : so you might imagine that the information you pass to , you know in identifying a particular referent would be , `` oh , some `` you know , `` it 's a guy and it 's someone i know from school `` . grad e : yeah . grad f : so maybe that would , you know , be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the , whatever , construal engine or whatever , discourse context , to find you know , either create this reference , grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : in which case it 'd be created here , and you know , so so you could imagine that this might not so , uh , i 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things . grad a : but to make it m precise at least in my mind , uh , it 's not precise . so `` house `` is gender neuter ? in reality grad f : um , it could be in grad a : or in professor c : semantically . grad a : semantically . grad f : semantically , yeah . yeah . grad a : so grad f : so it uh , uh , a table . you know , a thing that c does n't have a gender . so . uh , it could be that i mean , maybe you 'd maybe not all these i mean , i wou i would say that i tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most most things . grad a : no , just to make sure that we everybody that 's completely agreed that it it has nothing to do with , uh , form . grad f : yeah . ok , that is semantic as opposed to yeah . yeah . that 's right . um . grad a : then `` predications `` makes sense to to have it open for something like , uh , accessibility or not . grad f : s so again open to various things . grad a : yeah . grad f : right . ok , so . let 's see . so maybe having made that big sca sort of like large scale comment , should i just go through each of these slots uh , each of these blocks , um , a little bit ? grad e : sure . grad f : um , mostly the top one is sort of image schematic . and just a note , which was that , um s so when we actually ha so for instance , um , some of them seem more inherently static , ok , like a container or sort of support - ish . and others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like `` source , path , goal `` is often thought of that way or `` force `` , or something like that . but in actual fact , i think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that . and different x - schemas use them in a way that 's either static or dynamic . so `` path `` , you could just be talking about the path between this and this . and you know , `` container `` that you can go in and out . all of these things . and so , um , i think this came up when , uh , ben and i were working with the spaniards , um , the other day the `` spaniettes `` , as we called them um , to decide like how you want to split up , like , s image schematic contributions versus , like , x - schematic contributions . how do you link them up . and i think again , um , it 's gon na be something in the x - schema that tells you `` is this static or is this dynamic `` . so we definitely need that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that . um , that , you know , is it , uh , a state or is it a change of state , or is it a , um , action of some kind ? grad a : uh , i i i is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you do n't ? grad f : uh . yeah . grad a : just means grad f : oh , oh ! you mean , in the slot ? grad a : mm - hmm . grad f : um , no , it 's like x - sc it 's it 's like i was thinking of type constraints but x - schema , well it obviously has to be an x - schema . `` agent `` , i mean , the the performer of the x - schema , that s depends on the x - schema . you know , and i in general it would probably be , you know grad e : so the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were . grad f : yeah , basically . grad a : mm - hmm . grad f : um , `` aspectual type `` probably is n't obvious but i should have so , i just neglected to stick something in . `` perspective `` , `` actor `` , `` undergoer `` , `` observer `` , um , i think we 've often used `` agent `` , `` patient `` , obser grad e : `` whee ! `` that 's that one , right ? grad f : yeah , exactly . exactly . um , and so one nice thing that , uh , we had talked about is this example { comment } of like , if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch you know definitely , it is one way to for you to , you know , specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object . and so then we talked about , you know , whether well , does that specify topic as well ? well , maybe there are other things . you know , now that it 's subject is more like a topic . and now that , you know anyway . so . sorry . i 'm gon na trail off on that one cuz it 's not that f important right now . professor c : n now , for the moment we just need the ability to l l write it down if if somebody figured out what the rules were . grad f : um , to know how yeah . yeah . exactly . professor c : yeah . grad f : um , some of these other ones , let 's see . so , uh , one thing i 'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts . professor c : mm - hmm . grad f : so polarity , uh , is using for like action did not take place for instance . so by default it 'll be like `` true `` , i guess , you know , if you 're specifying events that did happen . you could imagine that you skip out this you know , leave off this polarity , you know , not do n't have it here . and then have it part of the speech - act in some way . professor c : mm - hmm . grad f : there 's some negation . but the reason why i left it in is cuz you might have a change of state , let 's say , where some state holds and then some state does n't hold , and you 're just talking , you know if you 're trying to have the nuts and bolts of simulation you need to know that , you know , whatever , the holder does n't and professor c : no , i th i think at this lev which is it should be where you have it . grad f : ok , it 's so it 's it 's it 's fine where it is . professor c : i mean , how you get it may may in will often involve the discourse grad f : so , ok . may come from a few places . professor c : but but by the time you 're simulating you sh y you should know that . grad f : right . right . grad e : so , i 'm still just really not clear on what i 'm looking at . the `` scenario `` box , like , what does that look like for an example ? like , not all of these things are gon na be here . grad f : yeah . professor c : correct . grad e : this is just basically says grad f : mm - hmm . it 's a grab bag of grad e : `` part of what i 'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of s uh , schemas , image , and x - schemas . here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there `` . grad f : so that 's exactly what it is . and for a particular instance which i will , you know , make an example of something , is that you might have an instance of container and path , let 's say , as part of your , you know , `` into `` you know , definition . grad e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad f : so you would eventually have instances filled in with various various values for all the different slots . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : and they 're bound up in , you know , their bindings and and and values . professor c : w it c grad e : ok . do you have to say about the binding in your is there a slot in here for that tells you how the bindings are done ? professor c : no , no , no . i let 's see , i think we 're we 're not i do n't think we have it quite right yet . so , uh , what this is , let 's suppose for the moment it 's complete . ok , uh , then this says that when an analysis is finished , the whole analysis is finished , { comment } you 'll have as a result , uh , some s resulting s semspec for that utterance in context , grad e : ok . mm - hmm . professor c : which is made up entirely of these things and , uh , bindings among them . and bindings to ontology items . grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : so that that the who that this is the tool kit under whi out of which you can make a semantic specification . grad e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c : so that 's a . but b , which is more relevant to your life , is this is also the tool kit that is used in the semantic side of constructions . grad e : ok . mm - hmm . professor c : so this is an that anything you have , in the party line , { comment } anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes , from pieces of this ignoring li i mean , in general , you ignore lots of it . grad e : right . professor c : but it 's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them . uh , so that the , you know , goal of the , uh uh , `` source , path , goal `` has to be the landmark of the conta you know , the interior of this container . grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : or whate whatever . grad e : yeah . professor c : so those constraints appear in constructions grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : but pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you . grad f : except for `` cause `` , that i forgot . but anyway , there 's som some kind of causal structure for composite events . grad e : yeah . professor c : ok , good . let 's let 's mark that . so we need a c grad f : uh , i mean , so it gets a little funny . these are all so far these structures , especially from `` path `` and on down , these are sort of relatively familiar , um , image schematic kind of slots . now with `` cause `` , uh , the fillers will actually be themselves frames . right ? professor c : right . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : so you 'll say , `` event one causes event b professor c : and and and and this this this again may ge our , um and we and and , of course , worlds . grad f : uh , event two `` , and grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : yeah . so that 's , uh these are all implicitly one within , uh within one world . um , even though saying that place takes place , whatever . uh , if y if i said `` time `` is , you know , `` past `` , that would say `` set that this world `` , you know , `` somewhere , before the world that corresponds to our current speech time `` . grad e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . grad f : so . but that that that 's sort of ok . the the within the event it 's st it 's still one world . um . yeah , so `` cause `` and other frames that could come in i mean , unfortunately you could bring in say for instance , um , uh , `` desire `` or something like that , grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : like `` want `` . and actually there is right now under `` discourse segments `` , um , `` attitude `` ? grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : `` volition `` ? could fill that . so there are a couple things where i like , `` oh , i 'm not sure if i wanted to have it there grad e : well that 's grad f : or `` basically there was a whole list of of possible speaker attitudes that like say talmy listed . and , like , well , i do n't you know , it was like `` hope , wish . desire `` , professor c : right . grad e : uh - huh . grad f : blah - blah - blah . and it 's like , well , i feel like if i wanted to have an extra meaning i do n't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place . so they 're more lexically marked , right ? at least in english . so if i wanted to i would stick in an extra frame in my meaning , saying , e so th it 'd be a hierarchical frame them , right ? you know , like `` naomi wants wants su a certain situation and that situation itself is a state of affairs `` . professor c : s right . so so , `` want `` itself can be i i i i i grad f : u can be just another frame that 's part of your professor c : well , and it i basically it 's an action . in in our s in our in our grad f : yeah . situation . { comment } right , right . professor c : in in our in our s terminology , `` want `` can be an action and `` what you want `` is a world . grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : so that 's i mean , it 's certainly one way to do it . yeah , there there are other things . grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : causal stuff we absolutely need . mental space we need . grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : the context we need . um , so anyway , keith so is this comfortable to you that , uh , once we have this defined , it is your tool kit for building the semantic part of constructions . grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : and then when we combine constructions semantically , the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the final one . grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : and that 's the wh and and i mean , that according to the party line , that 's the whole story . grad e : yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . um . y right . that makes sense . so i mean , there 's this stuff in the off in the scenario , which just tells you how various what schemas you 're using and they 're how they 're bound together . and i guess that some of the discourse segment stuff is that where you would sa grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : i mean , that 's ok , that 's where the information structure is which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of , um , of this . grad f : right . exactly . grad e : i mean , what 's interesting is that the information structure stuff hmm . there 's almost i mean , we keep coming back to how focus is like this this , uh , trajector - landmark thing . grad f : yeah . grad e : so if i say , um , you know , `` in france it 's like this `` . you know , great , we 've learned something about france but the fact is that utterances of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about some implicit contrast , like `` in france it 's like this `` . and therefore you 're supposed to say , `` boy , life sure `` grad f : right . grad e : you know , `` in france kids are allowed to drink at age three `` . and w you 're that 's not just a fact about france . you also conclude something about how boring it is here in the u s . right ? grad f : right , right . professor c : right . grad e : and so grad f : s so i would prefer not to worry about that for right now and to think that there are , um , grad e : that comes in and , uh grad f : discourse level constructions in a sense , topic topic - focus constructions that would say , `` oh , when you focus something `` then grad e : mm - hmm . yeah . grad f : just done the same way just actually in the same way as the lower level . if you stressed , you know , `` john went to the `` , you know , `` the bar `` whatever , you 're focusing that grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : and a in a possible inference is `` in contrast to other things `` . grad e : yeah . grad f : so similarly for a whole sentence , you know , `` in france such - and - such happens `` . grad e : yeah . yeah , yeah . grad f : so the whole thing is sort of like again implicitly as opposed to other things that are possible . grad e : yeah . grad a : uh , just just , uh , look read uh even sem semi formal mats rooth . grad f : i mean yeah . grad a : if you have n't read it . it 's nice . grad f : uh - huh . grad a : and just pick any paper on alternative semantics . grad f : uh - huh . grad a : so that 's his that 's the best way of talking about focus , is i think his way . grad e : ok , what was the name ? grad a : mats . mats . rooth . i think two o 's , yes , th . i never know how to pronounce his name because he 's sort of , professor c : s swede ? grad a : uh , he is dutch professor c : dutch ? grad a : and , um but very confused background i think . professor c : oh , dutch . grad e : yeah . professor c : uh - huh . grad a : so and , um , grad e : mats gould . grad a : and sadly enough he also just left the ims in stuttgart . so he 's not there anymore . but , um i do n't know where he is right now but alternative semantics is if you type that into an , uh , uh , browser or search engine you 'll get tons of stuff . grad e : ok . ok . ok , thanks . grad a : and what i 'm kind of confused about is is what the speaker and the hearer is is sort of doing there . grad f : so for a particular segment it 's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation , right ? so for a particular segment the speaker might be you or might be me . grad a : yeah . grad f : um , hearer is a little bit harder . it could be like multiple people . i guess that that that that 's not very clear from here grad a : yeah , but you do n't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place , grad f : i mean , that 's not allowed here . grad a : because `` you `` , `` me `` , `` he `` , `` they `` , you know , `` these guys `` , all these expressions , nuh , are in in much the same way contextually dependent as `` here , `` and `` now , `` and `` there `` grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : now , this is this is assuming you 've already solved that . grad f : ye - yeah . professor c : so it 's it 's fred and mary , so the speaker would be fred and the grad f : right , so the constructions might of course will refer , using pronouns or whatever . grad a : mm - hmm . grad f : in which case they have to check to see , uh , who the , uh , speaker in here wa in order to resolve those . but when you actually say that `` he walked into `` , whatever , um , the `` he `` will refer to a particular you you will already have figured who `` he `` or `` you `` , mmm , or `` i `` , maybe is a bett better example , who `` i `` refers to . um , and then you 'd just be able to refer to harry , you know , in wherever that person whatever role that person was playing in the event . grad a : mmm . that 's up at the reference part . grad f : yeah , yeah . grad a : and down there in the speaker - hearer part ? grad f : s so , that 's i think that 's just n for instance , speaker is known from the situation , right ? you 're when you hear something you 're told who the speaker is i mean , you know who the speaker is . in fact , that 's kind of constraining how in some ways you know this before you get to the you fill in all the rest of it . i think . i mean , how else would you um grad a : you know , uh , uh , it 's the speaker may in english is allowed to say `` i . `` professor c : yeah . well , here grad a : uh , among the twenty - five percent most used words . grad f : yeah . right . grad a : but would n't the `` i `` then set up the the s s referent that happens to be the speaker this time grad f : mm - hmm . grad a : and not `` they , `` whoever they are . grad f : right , right . grad a : or `` you `` grad f : so grad a : much like the `` you `` could n grad f : s so ok , so i would say ref under referent should be something that corresponds to `` i `` . and maybe each referent should probably have a list of way whatever , the way it was referred to . so that 's `` i `` but , uh , uh , should we say it it refers to , what ? uh , if it were `` harry `` it would refer to like some ontology thing . if it were if it 's `` i `` it would refer to the current speaker , ok , which is given to be like , you know , whoever it is . grad a : well , not not always . i mean , so there 's `` and then he said , i w `` uh - huh . professor c : uh grad f : `` i `` within the current world . grad a : yeah . professor c : yeah . that 's right . so so again , this uh , this this is gon na to get us into the mental space stuff grad f : yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . professor c : and t because you know , `` fred said that mary said `` , and whatever . grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : and and so we 're , uh gon na have to , um , chain those as well . grad a : mm - hmm . twhhh - whhh . but grad f : mm - hmm . so this entire thing is inside a world , professor c : right . right . grad f : not just like the top part . professor c : i i think , uh grad f : that 's grad a : mm - hmm . professor c : except s it 's it 's trickier than that because um , the reference for example so he where it gets really tricky is there 's some things , grad f : yeah . professor c : and this is where blends and all terribl so , some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which are n't . grad f : yeah . right . professor c : and again , all we need for the moment is some way to say that . grad f : right . so i thought of having like for each referent , having the list of of the things t with which it is identified . you know , which which , uh you know , you you you professor c : you could do that . grad f : for instance , um so , i guess , it sort of depends on if it is a referring exp if it 's identifiable already or it 's a new thing . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : if it 's a new thing you 'd have to like create a structure or whatever . if it 's an old thing it could be referring to , um , usually w something in a situation , right ? or something in ontology . professor c : uh - huh . grad f : so , there 's a you know , whatever , it c it could point at one of these . professor c : i just had a i just had an an idea that would be very nice if it works . grad f : for what ? professor c : uh , uh , uh , i have n't told you what it is yet . grad f : if it works . professor c : this was my build - up . grad f : mm - hmm . mmm . professor c : an i an idea that would be nice i grad f : yeah . ok , we 're crossing our fingers . professor c : right . grad b : so we 're building a mental space , good . professor c : if it worked . yeah . right , it was a space builder . um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces because , uh , you have somewhat the same things going on of , uh , things being accessible or not . grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : and so , i it c it it , uh i think if we did it right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure . grad f : use the same { comment } yep . professor c : so that pulling something out of a discourse context is i think similar to other kinds of , uh , mental space phenomena . grad b : i see . grad f : mm - hmm . and and professor c : uh , i 've i 've i 've never seen anybody write that up but maybe they did . i do n't know . that may be all over the literature . grad f : yeah . grad e : there 's things like ther you know , there 's all kinds of stuff like , um , in i think i mentioned last time in czech if you have a a verb of saying then grad f : so so by default grad e : um , you know , you say something like or or i was thinking you can say something like , `` oh , i thought , uh , you are a republican `` or something like that . where as in english you would say , `` i thought you were `` . professor c : right . grad e : um , you know , sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb does n't happen there , so you have to say something about , you know , tense is determined relative to current blah - blah - blah . grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : same things happens with pronouns . grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : there 's languages where , um , if you have a verb of saying then , ehhh , where ok , so a situation like `` bob said he was going to the movies `` , where that lower subject is the same as the person who was saying or thinking , you 're actually required to have `` i `` there . grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : mm - hmm . grad e : um , and it 's sort of in an extended function professor c : so we would have it be in quotes in english . grad e : yeah . grad b : right . grad e : but it 's not perceived as a quotative construction . grad f : right . professor c : yeah . grad e : i mean , it 's been analyzed by the formalists as being a logophoric pronoun , um which means a pronoun which refers back to the person who is speaking or that sort of thing , right ? grad f : oh , right . yeah , that makes sense . grad e : um , but uh , that happens to sound like the word for `` i `` but is actually semantically unrelated to it . grad f : oh , no ! professor c : oh , good , i love the formali grad f : really ? grad e : yeah . yeah . grad f : you 're kidding . grad e : there 's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption . uh , mary dalrymple , uh , this book , a ninety - three book on , uh on pronoun stuff . grad f : no , that 's horrible . ok . that 's horrible . { comment } ok . grad e : well , yeah . and then the same thing for asl where , you know , you 're signing and someone says something . and then , you know , so `` he say `` , and then you sort of do a role shift . and then you sign `` i , this , that , and the other `` . grad f : uh - huh . grad e : and you know , `` i did this `` . that 's also been analyzed as logophoric and having nothing to do with `` i `` . and the role shift thing is completely left out and so on . so , i mean , the point is that pronoun references , uh , you know , sort of ties in with all this mental space stuff and so on , and so forth . grad f : uh - huh . grad e : and so , yeah , i mean grad f : yeah . professor c : so that that d that does sound like it 's co consistent with what we 're saying , yeah . grad e : right . yeah . grad f : ok , so it 's kind of like the unspecified mental spaces just are occurring in context . and then when you embed them sometimes you have to pop up to the h you know , depending on the construction or the whatever , um , you you you 're scope is m might extend out to the the base one . grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : mm - hmm . grad e : yeah . grad f : it would be nice to actually use the same , um , mechanism since there are so many cases where you actually need it 'll be one or the other . grad e : yeah . grad f : it 's like , oh , actually , it 's the same same operation . professor c : oh , ok , so this this is worth some thought . grad e : it 's like it 's like what 's happening that , yeah , what what 's happening , uh , there is that you 're moving the base space or something like that , right ? grad f : yeah , yeah . grad e : so that 's that 's how fauconnier would talk about it . and it happens diff under different circumstances in different languages . grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : and so , grad f : mm - hmm . grad e : um , things like pronoun reference and tense which we 're thinking of as being these discourse - y things actually are relative to a bayes space which can change . grad f : mm - hmm , grad e : and we need all the same machinery . grad f : right . grad a : mm - hmm . grad f : robert . professor c : well , but , uh , this is very good actually grad e : schade . professor c : cuz it it it to the extent that it works , it y grad f : ties it all into it . professor c : it it ties together several of of these things . grad f : yeah . yep . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . and i 'm sure gon na read the transcript of this one . so . but the , uh , but it 's too bad that we do n't have a camera . you know , all the pointing is gon na be lost . grad e : yeah . grad f : oh , yeah . grad b : well every time nancy giggles it means it means that it 's your job . grad f : yeah , that 's why i said `` point to robert `` , when i did it . grad a : uh . yeah . mmm , is n't i mean , i 'm i was sort of dubious why why he even introduces this sort of reality , you know , as your basic mental space and then builds up grad e : mm - hmm . grad a : d does n't start with some because it 's so obvi it should be so obvious , at least it is to me , { comment } that whenever i say something i could preface that with `` i think . `` nuh ? grad e : yeah . grad a : so there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue . grad e : yeah . professor c : no , but there 's there 's a gricean thing going on there , that when you say `` i think `` you 're actually hedging . grad e : yeah , i mean grad f : mmm . it 's like i do n't totally think professor c : right . grad e : yeah . y grad f : i mostly think , uh grad a : yeah , it 's absolutely . grad e : yeah , it 's an it 's an evidential . it 's sort of semi - grammaticalized . people have talked about it this way . and you know , you can do sort of special things . you can , th put just the phrase `` i think `` as a parenthetical in the middle of a sentence and so on , and so forth . grad a : yeah . grad e : so grad f : actually one of the child language researchers who works with t tomasello studied a bunch of these constructions and it was like it 's not using any kind of interesting embedded ways just to mark , you know , uncertainty or something like that . grad e : yeah . grad a : yeah , but about linguistic hedges , i mean , those those tend to be , um , funky anyways because they blur professor c : so we do n't have that in here either do we ? grad e : yeah . grad f : hedges ? professor c : yeah , yeah . grad f : hhh , { comment } i there used to be a slot for speaker , um , it was something like factivity . i could n't really remember what it meant grad e : yeah . grad f : so i took it out . but it 's something grad e : well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that , right ? grad f : we we were talking about sarcasm too , right ? oh , oh . grad e : i mean , grad f : oh , yeah , yeah , right . grad e : that 's what i think is , um , sort of telling you what percent reality you should give this professor c : so we probably should . grad f : yeah . grad a : mm - hmm . grad e : or the , you know professor c : confidence or something like that . grad e : yeah , and the fact that i 'm , you know the fact maybe if i think it versus he thinks that might , you know , depending on how much you trust the two of us or whatever , grad f : yeah . grad a : uh great word in the english language is called `` about `` . grad e : you know grad a : if you study how people use that it 's also grad f : what 's the word ? grad a : `` about . `` it 's about professor c : about . grad a : clever . professor c : oh , that in that use of `` about `` , yeah . grad f : oh , oh , oh , as a hedge . grad e : yeah . professor c : and i think and i think y if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours you could get george started on that . grad e : he wrote a paper about thirty - five years ago on that one . grad b : i r i read that paper , professor c : yeah . grad b : the hedges paper ? i read some of that paper actually . grad e : yeah . professor c : yeah . grad e : would you believe that that paper lead directly to the development of anti - lock brakes ? grad f : what ? grad e : ask me about it later i 'll tell you how . when we 're not on tape . grad f : i 'd love to know . grad b : oh , man . grad f : so , and and i think , uh , someone had raised like sarcasm as a complication at some point . professor c : there 's all that stuff . yeah , let 's i i do n't i think grad f : and we just wo n't deal with sarcastic people . professor c : yeah , i mean grad e : i do n't really know what like we we do n't have to care too much about the speaker attitude , right ? like there 's not so many different hhh , { comment } i do n't know , m grad f : certainly not as some well , they 're intonational markers i think for the most part . grad e : yeah . grad f : i do n't know too much about the like grammatical grad e : i just mean there 's lots of different attitudes that that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify , and so on , and so forth . grad f : yeah . grad e : but like what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes ? professor c : right . right , so , uh , this this raises the question of what are our current purposes . grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : right ? grad e : oh , shoot . grad f : oh , yeah , do we have any ? grad e : here it is three - fifteen already . grad a : mmm . yeah . professor c : uh , so , um , i i do n't know the answer but but , um , it does seem that , you know , this is this is coming along . i think it 's it 's converging . it 's as far as i can tell there 's this one major thing we have to do which is the mental the whole s mental space thing . and then there 's some other minor things . grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : um , and we 're going to have to s sort of bound the complexity . i mean , if we get everything that anybody ever thought about you know , w we 'll go nuts . grad e : yeah . professor c : so we had started with the idea that the actual , uh , constraint was related to this tourist domain and the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain , assuming that people were being helpful and were n't trying to d you know , there 's all sorts of god knows , irony , and stuff like which you is n't probably of much use in dealing with a tourist guide . grad e : yeah . professor c : yeah ? grad e : yeah . grad f : m mockery . professor c : right . whatever . so y uh , no end of things th that that , you know , we do n't deal with . grad a : but it professor c : and grad a : i is n't that part easy though professor c : go ahead . grad a : because in terms of the s simspec , it would just mean you put one more set of brack brackets around it , and then just tell it to sort of negate whatever the content of that is in terms of irony grad e : yeah . professor c : n no . grad a : or grad e : right . grad f : maybe . yeah , in model theory cuz the semantics is always like `` speaker believes not - p `` , you know ? professor c : right . grad f : like `` the speaker says p and believes not - p `` . grad e : we have a theoretical model of sarcasm now . grad f : but professor c : right . grad e : yeah , right , i mean . professor c : no , no . grad f : right , right , but , professor c : anyway , so so , um , i guess uh , let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that , which is that , um , it was keith 's , uh , sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions . uh , and my suggestion to keith is that you , over the next couple weeks , n do n't try to do them in detail or formally but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have . uh , and then when robert gets back we 'll look at the set of them . just just sort of , you know , define your space . grad e : yeah , ok . professor c : and , um , so th these are this is a set of things that i think we ought to deal with . grad e : yeah . professor c : and then we 'll we 'll we 'll go back over it and w people will will give feedback on it . and then then we 'll have a at least initial spec of of what we 're actually trying to do . grad e : yeah . professor c : and that 'll also be useful for anybody who 's trying to write a parser . grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : knowing uh grad e : in case there 's any around . grad f : if we knew anybody like that . professor c : right , `` who might want `` et cetera . so , uh so a and we get this this , uh , portals fixed and then we have an idea of the sort of initial range . and then of course nancy you 're gon na have to , uh , do your set of but you have to do that anyway . grad f : for the same , yeah , data . yeah , mm - hmm . professor c : so so we 're gon na get the w we 're basically dealing with two domains , the tourist domain and the and the child language learning . and we 'll see what we need for those two . and then my proposal would be to , um , not totally cut off more general discussion but to focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we 've we really want to get done . grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : and then as a kind of separate thread , think about the more general things and and all that . grad e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : well , i also think the detailed discussion will hit you know , bring us to problems that are of a general nature and maybe even professor c : uh , without doubt . yeah . grad f : yeah . grad a : even suggest some solutions . professor c : but what i want to do is is is to to constrain the things that we really feel responsible for . grad a : yeah . mmm . professor c : so that that we say these are the things we 're really gon na try do by the end of the summer grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : and other things we 'll put on a list of of research problems or something , because you can easily get to the point where nothing gets done because every time you start to do something you say , `` oh , yeah , but what about this case ? `` grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : this is this is called being a linguist . grad e : yeah . professor c : and , uh , grad e : basically . grad f : or me . or me . anyways grad b : there 's that quote in jurafsky and martin where where it goes where some guy goes , `` every time i fire a linguist the performance of the recognizer goes up . `` professor c : right . grad f : yeah . grad e : exactly . professor c : right . but anyway . so , is is that does that make sense as a , uh a general way to proceed ? grad f : sure , yeah . grad e : yeah , yeah , we 'll start with that , just figuring out what needs to be done then actually the next step is to start trying to do it . professor c : exactly right . grad e : got it . grad a : we have a little bit of news , uh , just minor stuff . the one big grad b : ooo , can i ask a grad e : you ran out of power . grad b : can i ask a quick question about this side ? grad a : yeah . grad b : is this , uh was it intentional to leave off things like `` inherits `` and grad f : oops . um , not really just on the constructions , right ? grad b : yeah , like constructions can inherit from other things , am i right ? grad f : yeah . grad b : yeah . grad f : i did n't want to think too much about that for for now . professor c : yeah . grad f : so , uh , maybe it was subconsciously intentional . professor c : yeah , uh yeah . grad e : um , yeah , there should be i i wanted to s find out someday if there was gon na be some way of dealing with , uh , if this is the right term , multiple inheritance , professor c : mm - hmm . grad e : where one construction is inheriting from , uh from both parents , grad f : uh - huh . yep . grad e : uh , or different ones , or three or four different ones . professor c : yeah . so let me grad e : cuz the problem is that then you have to grad f : yeah . grad e : which of you know , which are how they 're getting bound together . grad f : refer to them . professor c : yeah , right , right , right . yeah , yeah , yeah . grad f : yeah , and and there are certainly cases like that . even with just semantic schemas we have some examples . professor c : right . grad f : so , and we 've been talking a little bit about that anyway . professor c : yeah . so what i would like to do is separate that problem out . grad f : inherits . professor c : so um , my argument is there 's nothing you can do with that that you ca n't do by just having more constructions . grad e : yeah , yes . professor c : it 's uglier and it d does n't have the deep linguistic insights and stuff . grad e : that 's right . but whatever . professor c : right . grad e : yeah , no , no , no no . grad f : uh , those are over rated . grad e : no , by all means , professor c : and so i what i 'd like to do is is in the short run focus on getting it right . grad e : right . uh , sure . professor c : and when we think we have it right then saying , `` aha ! , grad e : yeah . professor c : can we make it more elegant ? `` grad e : yeah , that 's professor c : can can we , uh what are the generalizations , and stuff ? grad e : yeah . connect the dots . yeah . professor c : but rather than try to guess a inheritance structure and all that sort of stuff before we know what we 're doing . grad e : yep . yeah . professor c : so i would say in the short run we 're not gon na b grad e : yeah . professor c : first of all , we 're not doing them yet at all . and and it could be that half way through we say , `` aha ! , we we now see how we want to clean it up . `` grad e : mm - hmm . professor c : uh , and inheritance is only one i mean , that 's one way to organize it but there are others . and it may or may not be the best way . grad e : yeah . professor c : i 'm sorry , you had news . grad a : oh , just small stuff . um , thanks to eva on our web site we can now , if you want to run javabayes , uh , you could see get download these classes . and then it will enable you she modified the gui so it has now a m a m a button menu item for saving it into the embedded javabayes format . grad d : mm - hmm . grad a : so that 's wonderful . professor c : great . grad a : and , um and she , a you tested it out . do you want to say something about that , that it works , right ? with the grad d : i was just checking like , when we wan na , um , get the posterior probability of , like , variables . you know how you asked whether we can , like , just observe all the variables like in the same list ? you ca n't . grad a : uh - huh . grad d : you have to make separate queries every time . grad a : ok , that 's that 's a bit unfortunate grad d : so yeah . grad a : but for the time being it 's it 's it 's fine to do it grad d : you just have to have a long list of , you know , all the variables . grad a : yeah . but uh grad d : basically . grad f : uh , all the things you want to query , you just have to like ask for separately . grad d : yeah , yeah . grad a : well that 's probably maybe in the long term that 's good news because it forces us to think a little bit more carefully how how we want to get an out output . um , but that 's a different discussion for a different time . and , um , i do n't know . we 're really running late , so i had , uh , an idea yesterday but , uh , i do n't know whether we should even start discussing . professor c : w what yeah , sure , tell us what it is . grad a : um , the construal bit that , um , has been pointed to but has n't been , um , made precise by any means , um , may w may work as follows . i thought that we would , uh that the following thing would be in incredibly nice and i have no clue whether it will work at all or nothing . so that 's just a tangent , a couple of mental disclaimers here . um , imagine you you write a bayes - net , um grad f : bayes ? grad a : bayes - net , um , completely from scratch every time you do construal . so you have nothing . just a white piece of paper . professor c : mmm , right . grad a : you consult consult your ontology which will tell you a bunch of stuff , and parts , and properties , uh - uh - uh grad f : grout out the things that that you need . professor c : right . grad a : then y you 'd simply write , uh , these into onto your your white piece of paper . and you will get a lot of notes and stuff out of there . you wo n't get you wo n't really get any c p t 's , therefore we need everything that that configures to what the situation is , ie , the context dependent stuff . so you get whatever comes from discourse but also filtered . uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse plus the situation and the user model . grad f : mm - hmm . grad a : and that fills in your cpt 's with which you can then query , um , the the net that you just wrote and find out how thing x is construed as an utterance u . and the embedded javabayes works exactly like that , that once you we have , you know , precise format in which to write it , so we write it down . you query it . you get the result , and you throw it away . and the the nice thing about this idea is that you do n't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it . you may have some general rules as to how things can be can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the the the initial notes . but it 's in that respect it 's completely scalable . because it does n't have any prior , um , configuration . it 's just you need an ontology of the domain and you need the context dependent modules . and if this can be made to work at all , that 'd be kind of funky . professor c : um , it sounds to me like you want p r grad a : p r ms - uh , prm i mean , since you can unfold a prm into a straightforward bayes - net professor c : beca - because it b because no , no , you ca n't . see the the critical thing about the prm is it gives these relations in general form . so once you have instantiated the prm with the instances and ther then you can then you can unfold it . grad a : then you can . mm - hmm , yeah . no , i was m using it generic . so , uh , probabilistic , whatever , relational models . whatever you write it . in professor c : well , no , but it matters a lot because you what you want are these generalized rules about the way things relate , th that you then instantiate in each case . grad a : and then then instantiate them . that 's ma maybe the the way the only way it works . professor c : yeah , and that 's yeah , that 's the only way it could work . i we have a our local expert on p r uh , but my guess is that they 're not currently good enough to do that . but we 'll we 'll have to see . grad a : but , uh , professor c : uh yes . this is that 's that would be a good thing to try . it 's related to the hobbs abduction story in that you th you throw everything into a pot and you try to come up with the , uh grad a : except there 's no no theorem prover involved . grad f : best explanation . professor c : no , there is n't a theorem prover but there but but the , um , the cove the the p r ms are like rules of inference and you 're you 're coupling a bunch of them together . grad a : mm - hmm , yeah . professor c : and then ins instead of proving you 're trying to , you know , compute the most likely . uh tricky . but you yeah , it 's a good it 's a it 's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal . grad a : what 's it ? professor c : so are you gon na write something for us before you go ? grad a : yes . um . professor c : oh , you have something . grad a : in the process thereof , or whatever . professor c : ok . so , what 's what when are we gon na meet again ? grad f : when are you leaving ? grad a : fri - uh , grad f : thursday , friday ? grad a : thursday 's my last day here . professor c : yeah . grad a : so i would suggest as soon as possible . do you mean by we , the whole ben gang ? professor c : n no , i did n't mean y just the two of us . we obviously we can we can do this . but the question is do you want to , for example , send the little group , uh , a draft of your thesis proposal and get , uh , another session on feedback on that ? or grad a : we can do it th - thursday again . yeah . grad e : fine with me . should we do the one pm time for thursday since we were on that before or ? grad a : sure . professor c : alright . grad a : thursday at one ? i can also maybe then sort of run through the , uh the talk i have to give at eml which highlights all of our work . and we can make some last minute changes on that . grad b : you can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper . professor c : that - that 'll tell him exactly what 's going on . yeah , that alright . grad f : can we do can we do one - thirty ? oh , you already told me no . grad a : but we can do four . grad f : one , ok , it 's fine . i can do one . it 's fine . it 's fine . grad a : one or four . i do n't care . grad e : to me this is equal . i do n't care . grad a : if it 's equal for all ? what should we do ? grad f : yeah , it 's fine . grad a : four ? grad f : fine . yeah no , no , no , uh , i do n't care . it 's fine . grad a : it 's equal to all of us , so you can decide one or four . grad b : the pressure 's on you nancy . grad a : liz actually said she likes four because it forces the meeting recorder people to cut , you know the discussions short . grad f : ok . ok , four . grad e : well , if you insist , then ."
