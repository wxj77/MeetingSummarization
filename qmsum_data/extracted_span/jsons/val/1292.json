    "query": "<s> why did the industrial design disagree with the user interface when discussing the shape of the remote control ?",
    "answer": "user interface : uh i have to say though that um another idea 's come up in my head . if we 're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something . marketing : uh interesting . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? user interface : just a thought . industrial designer : what 's the uh idea ? user interface : well if you do n't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . marketing : i if it 's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . industrial designer : hmm . do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gon na wan na use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes ."
