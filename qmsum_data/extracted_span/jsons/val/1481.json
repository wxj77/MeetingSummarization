    "answer": "industrial designer : right , i am going to tell you something about the components design . uh again i have uh put up the specification properties . this uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . and the materials ? um i have heard several things , so i uh i 'll have to change that on the way . but uh the case ? uh i suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . but uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . marketing : yeah , we should change that . industrial designer : it should feel strong . so maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . project manager : well maybe it it it is , industrial designer : we should move to uh something project manager : but it does n't look strong . so maybe industrial designer : well yeah . y hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it does n't have a really really tough look . so marketing : no no no . project manager : but we still have to look at our price of course . because uh if we want an lcd uh window etcetera uh industrial designer : yeah . also yeah . mm-hmm . but we 'll return to that . project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : uh the buttons of course rubber , i think everyone agrees . and electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . the chips made of silicon , i guess . i think that 's the best uh way to do it . project manager : industrial designer : and infra infrared l led is uh just a simple bulb . marketing : industrial designer : then i 've uh had a few findings , made a few findings . uh the target audience product style . um it 's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . they also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . but of course that 's not our uh things this . so this is things we must not do . and then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . um under forty five years old . uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . marketing : mm . yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . and also they like curved round shapes . so not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . and if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . but uh since we do n't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we do n't really have to consider that . project manager : sports uh , they 're uh that uh are accessible on on your lcd uh window uh user interface : soccer fronts . mm . marketing : project manager : huh ? that 's nice . all the results ? industrial designer : well i also have um several examples of uh styles , marketing : we keep coming back to the fronts . project manager : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so you can get a clear picture of uh what i mean . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh these are the basic uh older older peoples ' stuff . user interface : project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , project manager : mm-hmm . nai . uh no . industrial designer : but that 's n that 's not what we want . we have these kind of things . i do n't know what exactly they are . marketing : fruity . fruity . industrial designer : it looks like well you know uh you recognise the shapes , project manager : industrial designer : it 's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . project manager : industrial designer : you also uh see uh this device , it 's not very round and fruity of course . yeah , it uh project manager : it 's t terrible . industrial designer : that 's true . project manager : alright . industrial designer : and uh well round shapes , primary colours . project manager : industrial designer : you can see it all here . and of course uh this famous device . i think as you know something uh some devices like this . project manager : yeah , alright . industrial designer : so to give you an idea of uh marketing : well it 's got a strong look , this . yeah . industrial designer : this has a strong look . although it 's plastic , it 's it 's grey to to to give it iron look . marketing : yeah , it still has a strong look . project manager : yeah . and it 's round . industrial designer : that 's uh marketing : but then you are losing your fruity colours . industrial designer : yeah . well we have to make a project manager : well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . so uh those kind of things you can you can combine . marketing : that 's true . industrial designer : well we ca n't really make a round uh a round remote control . i do n't think that 's very practical , project manager : no , it is n't . industrial designer : but but uh it 's important to to uh to think about the colour . project manager : okay . industrial designer : because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . 'cause if you look at this , it it does n't look very very strong , marketing : yeah but the industrial designer : becau but this is plastic , and and this too , but marketing : but it does n't have to look strong . the the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . industrial designer : the feel ? uh alright . marketing : the feel . project manager : so , if you ti industrial designer : well user interface : and it it does n't have to be strong , also . project manager : well marketing : nah yeah the feel project manager : you you maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . user interface : only the feel . project manager : so it it looks pretty but it feels strong . user interface : industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : right . industrial designer : and i then i have some more findings . um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , marketing : i agree . industrial designer : uh i uh suggest uh the basic battery . i uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . but solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you do n't have a have a lot of uh sun . marketing : industrial designer : and uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , i think , for uh for a simple remote , marketing : industrial designer : that 's a bit , oh , that 's a bit uh that 's a bit uh much . project manager : no titanium . user interface : industrial designer : and i also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . project manager : industrial designer : uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . that that 's the information i received . if you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you ca n't use titanium . project manager : what do you exactly mean with double curved ? industrial designer : now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . and uh now the the shape , yeah , a curved case . um yeah i think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . uh a more modern look not plain , long box style , but marketing : i dunno . project manager : double curved ? industrial designer : i 'll draw it , project manager : it it mean user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : yeah , well okay . industrial designer : but maybe later . marketing : industrial designer : and it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh . um anyway user interface : marketing : industrial designer : um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . no uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . and , uh as we agreed , we do n't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device . marketing : yeah right . industrial designer : because it makes it also more complex and expensive . but we do use an lcd screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . but it 's worth the trouble i think , project manager : well user interface : the buttons can be made of an uh a soft material . industrial designer : because user interface : because people like that . project manager : this soft material thing from uh yeah . industrial designer : uh rubber is a soft material , i guess . user interface : yeah . right . yeah . industrial designer : uh soft enough . marketing : yeah . right . industrial designer : so that 's uh basically what i want to talk about ."
