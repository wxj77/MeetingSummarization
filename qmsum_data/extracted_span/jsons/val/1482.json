    "answer": "user interface : yeah . well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . um an lcd s screen will be implemented . um we must decide where , this meeting . project manager : marketing : user interface : um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . and um well they 're cheap , so we could use them now . project manager : oh that 's interesting . user interface : um it 's not really speech recognition , it 's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . so if i say hi mike , and you have recorded uh hi mike back , then you will get that . industrial designer : oh , yeah , i understand . yeah . marketing : oh okay . project manager : okay . but you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . marketing : right . user interface : no it does n't does not do anything . project manager : oh . that 's a bit uh user interface : but i it 's just a marketing : but that that makes it cheap . project manager : yes . i understand . user interface : yeah it 's it 's cheap . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it 's it 's just a an extra function , project manager : but it has no functionality for our remote at all . marketing : and it 's cheap . no but user interface : but that 's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . marketing : yeah , right . industrial designer : but it it 's n nice for young people . marketing : young people love them . user interface : yes , we we should really uh include that one , i think . um industrial designer : they like gadgets . yeah . marketing : yeah , ple right . industrial designer : if it 's cheap . yeah . user interface : well , as i said uh earlier i think the uh lcd screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . project manager : user interface : um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff marketing : user interface : um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the lcd screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . project manager : so you put a menu in the lcd ? user interface : i think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , i think . for the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . a voice recognition can be uh implemented . and uh i drew an example , industrial designer : user interface : but it did not work quite the well uh the way i wanted it to do . marketing : alright . industrial designer : can you draw it now of uh marketing : how how user interface : hmm ? well i have the i can draw it again , industrial designer : can you draw it now ? user interface : and i know what i did wrong . i did n't tick the note bo box in the . um industrial designer : mm . alright . marketing : how do you uh uh give input to the menu on the lcd screen ? user interface : um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the marketing : alright . so you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . project manager : but then we should also have an uh an okay button . user interface : well i will draw what i had drawn on the screen . yes . marketing : yeah right . user interface : um i shall draw this . if it uh works . industrial designer : button , yeah . project manager : just uh there is already a blank . yes ? so yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm so have i . project manager : user interface : marketing : . you have to push hard . project manager : marketing : industrial designer : i suggest a banana shape . project manager : user interface : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : because of the fruity uh fashion . marketing : yeah . project manager : no m next year that 's out . user interface : industrial designer : yellow and marketing : industrial designer : yeah alright , yeah . just a hunch . project manager : user interface : well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? user interface : yeah just uh the numbers . industrial designer : and then below is the lcd screen ? user interface : these these will be bigger in the the real design . project manager : industrial designer : alright , yeah . user interface : this must be the okay button used to uh interact with the lcd screen . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : and with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus project manager : yeah . user interface : and that can um the video button should be uh an apart button , marketing : you 've user interface : because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click . marketing : right . project manager : and what 's the menu button ? user interface : um it 's marketing : and you you need a you need a speaker . for the user interface : this button can also be the menu button , we use in the menus industrial designer : project manager : but how did how do you get out of the menu then ? yeah . user interface : well we we can add another button here , but project manager : maybe i you could j just do an an exit with okay . uh industrial designer : uh by pe pressing the menu button again . by pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : it 's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . project manager : yes , well but bec because when you push menu you get in , industrial designer : yeah ? yeah ? project manager : and then you have to push okay when you get to a choice . user interface : ah right . well you you industrial designer : yeah . but you can men you can press menu again to get out . project manager : well that 's also the okay button . that 's you you should have uh user interface : no no , we we we should uh add uh a extra menu button project manager : or you can put in the lcd 's uh window an option get out . user interface : and this the okay button . marketing : exit . project manager : exit . user interface : ah once you have an extra menu button , you do n't need that that extra option . project manager : well , it 's just a choice . user interface : you have uh redundancy . marketing : but we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . user interface : yeah , marketing : or do n't user interface : if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . industrial designer : why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? user interface : well they that could be anywhere . industrial designer : where would you put it ? user interface : that 's very small . it could be uh down here . um . well , not here . industrial designer : uh-huh . user interface : i yeah i suggest here . but that 's just a little gap . yeah . industrial designer : microphone , yeah . marketing : right , and spea speaker at the back , or something . user interface : well the speaker and the microphone , i think , are the same uh little hole thingy . industrial designer : yeah i understand . project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : alright . industrial designer : uh but uh we could uh d do , but it 's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . user interface : well i um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they wo n't be uh very expensive . but industrial designer : alright . marketing : alright . project manager : yeah ?
