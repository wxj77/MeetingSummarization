    "answer": "professor b : i had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that some of the other stuff that avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy sections ? um , uh , if you if you did a high - pass filtering , as hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , avendano and hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you got ta figure out what to do with them if you 're gon na continue treating this as a power spectrum . so , what what hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero set the negative values to zero . so if you imagine a a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . and it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . you know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in so in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing . i mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n and , um , what if you did ? i mean , there 's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . i mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer . grad e : uh - huh . professor b : and one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of vad - like thing grad e : mm - hmm . professor b : and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some , uh , very low or or near zero value . i mean , uh , i 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh grad e : uh - huh . professor b : or pre - echoes , whichever they are are are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them . grad e : uh - huh . professor b : be pretty simple . i mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech ."
