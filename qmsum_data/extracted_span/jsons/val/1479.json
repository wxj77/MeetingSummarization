    "answer": "project manager : okay . uh door is closed . industrial designer : project manager : well , let 's begin . because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we 'll have to hurry up . marketing : i 'm listening . industrial designer : marketing : right . project manager : um well i 'll start with the presentation again , the agenda . industrial designer : marketing : great . project manager : yo . so . uh this one i think . marketing : project manager : uh yeah . well alright . um well , i 'll show you the notes . it 's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting , marketing : project manager : but i 'll show them . we 'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . um then we 'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . i 've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : so this time we exactly know what to decide about . marketing : alright , great . project manager : and then we 'll close again . industrial designer : alright . project manager : uh well these are some examples , but we 'll talk about them later . we 'll first look at your uh presentations . alright ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : walter will uh start again this time ? marketing : yeah , great . alright , trendwatch . project manager : 'kay . marketing : right . i will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . project manager : 'kay . marketing : uh the trends . it 's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . uh this because of our last model was very functional , but it uh people did n't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . that 's uh something you uh have to take a look at . industrial designer : mm-hmm . alright . marketing : and uh the feeling has to be very great . also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . industrial designer : alright . marketing : um there 's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . this is uh two times as less important , project manager : less . industrial designer : marketing : and uh same for this one . um , technological technological innovations , that 's uh regarded very highly too . project manager : marketing : uh such as an uh lcd screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . project manager : well , yeah . marketing : so we have to have uh something like that , like we uh project manager : lcd and our uh our fronts . marketing : right . uh the last point is easy to use . well i think that uh speaks for s for itself . i do n't know who 's uh who 's going to look at that . industrial designer : easy to use ? project manager : well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh marketing : yeah ? industrial designer : i think that 's your ta project manager : functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . marketing : yeah , i know . project manager : well we have to choose one of them . marketing : i think we have to go for the first one . project manager : yeah . marketing : it 's the most important one . so we have to uh take that one . project manager : okay . marketing : so it it it is n't very important that that it works easy . user interface : well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . industrial designer : marketing : but it has to look great . project manager : yeah . we 'll we 'll look at uh . industrial designer : you yeah . yeah , yeah , marketing : we 'll see . industrial designer : you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use it 's not a very comp complicated device . marketing : yeah , right . but the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that 's real great uh great concept . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : alright . marketing : alright . uh these are the new colours of this year . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : so it must be very bright , very colourful . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : people like this . project manager : user interface : marketing : so we we have to think uh in this direction . project manager : so marketing : so i set your mind to it . user interface : project manager : well marketing : findings ? fashion update ? fruit and vegetables are cool . industrial designer : uh you think ? marketing : i am told . project manager : user interface : marketing : the group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . industrial designer : marketing : so we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . industrial designer : project manager : yeah , well user interface : bananas . marketing : uh furthermore uh material , that 's your part , should be very strong . i was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , project manager : yeah . marketing : that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong . and that 's uh also for the younger public . project manager : well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . th this year it 's fruits but next year it 's it 's something totally different . marketing : yeah , that 's great . user interface : yeah . marketing : but i think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . so it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily . project manager : yep , alright . marketing : well , the don'ts . older people like dark colours and simple shapes . well we do n't want uh older people , user interface : marketing : we want young people . industrial designer : marketing : so uh we 're gon na turn that around . project manager : industrial designer : alright . marketing : we 're gon na have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . right ? project manager : wood is popular . aha . marketing : okay . we do n't want wood . project manager : yeah yeah yeah . industrial designer : yeah , among the old people , yeah . marketing : old people . so , that 's it for me . project manager : alright . nice , uh well show us . industrial designer : right , i am going to tell you something about the components design . uh again i have uh put up the specification properties . this uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . and the materials ? um i have heard several things , so i uh i 'll have to change that on the way . but uh the case ? uh i suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . but uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . marketing : yeah , we should change that . industrial designer : it should feel strong . so maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . project manager : well maybe it it it is , industrial designer : we should move to uh something project manager : but it does n't look strong . so maybe industrial designer : well yeah . y hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it does n't have a really really tough look . so marketing : no no no . project manager : but we still have to look at our price of course . because uh if we want an lcd uh window etcetera uh industrial designer : yeah . also yeah . mm-hmm . but we 'll return to that . project manager : yeah ? industrial designer : uh the buttons of course rubber , i think everyone agrees . and electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . the chips made of silicon , i guess . i think that 's the best uh way to do it . project manager : industrial designer : and infra infrared l led is uh just a simple bulb . marketing : industrial designer : then i 've uh had a few findings , made a few findings . uh the target audience product style . um it 's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . they also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . but of course that 's not our uh things this . so this is things we must not do . and then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . um under forty five years old . uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . marketing : mm . yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . and also they like curved round shapes . so not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . and if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . but uh since we do n't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we do n't really have to consider that . project manager : sports uh , they 're uh that uh are accessible on on your lcd uh window uh user interface : soccer fronts . mm . marketing : project manager : huh ? that 's nice . all the results ? industrial designer : well i also have um several examples of uh styles , marketing : we keep coming back to the fronts . project manager : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so you can get a clear picture of uh what i mean . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh these are the basic uh older older peoples ' stuff . user interface : project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : it was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , project manager : mm-hmm . nai . uh no . industrial designer : but that 's n that 's not what we want . we have these kind of things . i do n't know what exactly they are . marketing : fruity . fruity . industrial designer : it looks like well you know uh you recognise the shapes , project manager : industrial designer : it 's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . project manager : industrial designer : you also uh see uh this device , it 's not very round and fruity of course . yeah , it uh project manager : it 's t terrible . industrial designer : that 's true . project manager : alright . industrial designer : and uh well round shapes , primary colours . project manager : industrial designer : you can see it all here . and of course uh this famous device . i think as you know something uh some devices like this . project manager : yeah , alright . industrial designer : so to give you an idea of uh marketing : well it 's got a strong look , this . yeah . industrial designer : this has a strong look . although it 's plastic , it 's it 's grey to to to give it iron look . marketing : yeah , it still has a strong look . project manager : yeah . and it 's round . industrial designer : that 's uh marketing : but then you are losing your fruity colours . industrial designer : yeah . well we have to make a project manager : well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . so uh those kind of things you can you can combine . marketing : that 's true . industrial designer : well we ca n't really make a round uh a round remote control . i do n't think that 's very practical , project manager : no , it is n't . industrial designer : but but uh it 's important to to uh to think about the colour . project manager : okay . industrial designer : because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . 'cause if you look at this , it it does n't look very very strong , marketing : yeah but the industrial designer : becau but this is plastic , and and this too , but marketing : but it does n't have to look strong . the the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . industrial designer : the feel ? uh alright . marketing : the feel . project manager : so , if you ti industrial designer : well user interface : and it it does n't have to be strong , also . project manager : well marketing : nah yeah the feel project manager : you you maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . user interface : only the feel . project manager : so it it looks pretty but it feels strong . user interface : industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : right . industrial designer : and i then i have some more findings . um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , marketing : i agree . industrial designer : uh i uh suggest uh the basic battery . i uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . but solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you do n't have a have a lot of uh sun . marketing : industrial designer : and uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , i think , for uh for a simple remote , marketing : industrial designer : that 's a bit , oh , that 's a bit uh that 's a bit uh much . project manager : no titanium . user interface : industrial designer : and i also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . project manager : industrial designer : uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . that that 's the information i received . if you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you ca n't use titanium . project manager : what do you exactly mean with double curved ? industrial designer : now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . and uh now the the shape , yeah , a curved case . um yeah i think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . uh a more modern look not plain , long box style , but marketing : i dunno . project manager : double curved ? industrial designer : i 'll draw it , project manager : it it mean user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : yeah , well okay . industrial designer : but maybe later . marketing : industrial designer : and it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh . um anyway user interface : marketing : industrial designer : um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . no uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . and , uh as we agreed , we do n't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device . marketing : yeah right . industrial designer : because it makes it also more complex and expensive . but we do use an lcd screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . but it 's worth the trouble i think , project manager : well user interface : the buttons can be made of an uh a soft material . industrial designer : because user interface : because people like that . project manager : this soft material thing from uh yeah . industrial designer : uh rubber is a soft material , i guess . user interface : yeah . right . yeah . industrial designer : uh soft enough . marketing : yeah . right . industrial designer : so that 's uh basically what i want to talk about . project manager : alright . okay . we will take that . and then uh mike ? okay . user interface : yeah . well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . um an lcd s screen will be implemented . um we must decide where , this meeting . project manager : marketing : user interface : um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . and um well they 're cheap , so we could use them now . project manager : oh that 's interesting . user interface : um it 's not really speech recognition , it 's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . so if i say hi mike , and you have recorded uh hi mike back , then you will get that . industrial designer : oh , yeah , i understand . yeah . marketing : oh okay . project manager : okay . but you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . marketing : right . user interface : no it does n't does not do anything . project manager : oh . that 's a bit uh user interface : but i it 's just a marketing : but that that makes it cheap . project manager : yes . i understand . user interface : yeah it 's it 's cheap . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it 's it 's just a an extra function , project manager : but it has no functionality for our remote at all . marketing : and it 's cheap . no but user interface : but that 's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . marketing : yeah , right . industrial designer : but it it 's n nice for young people . marketing : young people love them . user interface : yes , we we should really uh include that one , i think . um industrial designer : they like gadgets . yeah . marketing : yeah , ple right . industrial designer : if it 's cheap . yeah . user interface : well , as i said uh earlier i think the uh lcd screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . project manager : user interface : um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff marketing : user interface : um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the lcd screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . project manager : so you put a menu in the lcd ? user interface : i think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , i think . for the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . a voice recognition can be uh implemented . and uh i drew an example , industrial designer : user interface : but it did not work quite the well uh the way i wanted it to do . marketing : alright . industrial designer : can you draw it now of uh marketing : how how user interface : hmm ? well i have the i can draw it again , industrial designer : can you draw it now ? user interface : and i know what i did wrong . i did n't tick the note bo box in the . um industrial designer : mm . alright . marketing : how do you uh uh give input to the menu on the lcd screen ? user interface : um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the marketing : alright . so you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . project manager : but then we should also have an uh an okay button . user interface : well i will draw what i had drawn on the screen . yes . marketing : yeah right . user interface : um i shall draw this . if it uh works . industrial designer : button , yeah . project manager : just uh there is already a blank . yes ? so yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm so have i . project manager : user interface : marketing : . you have to push hard . project manager : marketing : industrial designer : i suggest a banana shape . project manager : user interface : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : because of the fruity uh fashion . marketing : yeah . project manager : no m next year that 's out . user interface : industrial designer : yellow and marketing : industrial designer : yeah alright , yeah . just a hunch . project manager : user interface : well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? user interface : yeah just uh the numbers . industrial designer : and then below is the lcd screen ? user interface : these these will be bigger in the the real design . project manager : industrial designer : alright , yeah . user interface : this must be the okay button used to uh interact with the lcd screen . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : and with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus project manager : yeah . user interface : and that can um the video button should be uh an apart button , marketing : you 've user interface : because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click . marketing : right . project manager : and what 's the menu button ? user interface : um it 's marketing : and you you need a you need a speaker . for the user interface : this button can also be the menu button , we use in the menus industrial designer : project manager : but how did how do you get out of the menu then ? yeah . user interface : well we we can add another button here , but project manager : maybe i you could j just do an an exit with okay . uh industrial designer : uh by pe pressing the menu button again . by pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : it 's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . project manager : yes , well but bec because when you push menu you get in , industrial designer : yeah ? yeah ? project manager : and then you have to push okay when you get to a choice . user interface : ah right . well you you industrial designer : yeah . but you can men you can press menu again to get out . project manager : well that 's also the okay button . that 's you you should have uh user interface : no no , we we we should uh add uh a extra menu button project manager : or you can put in the lcd 's uh window an option get out . user interface : and this the okay button . marketing : exit . project manager : exit . user interface : ah once you have an extra menu button , you do n't need that that extra option . project manager : well , it 's just a choice . user interface : you have uh redundancy . marketing : but we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . user interface : yeah , marketing : or do n't user interface : if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . industrial designer : why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? user interface : well they that could be anywhere . industrial designer : where would you put it ? user interface : that 's very small . it could be uh down here . um . well , not here . industrial designer : uh-huh . user interface : i yeah i suggest here . but that 's just a little gap . yeah . industrial designer : microphone , yeah . marketing : right , and spea speaker at the back , or something . user interface : well the speaker and the microphone , i think , are the same uh little hole thingy . industrial designer : yeah i understand . project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : alright . industrial designer : uh but uh we could uh d do , but it 's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . user interface : well i um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they wo n't be uh very expensive . but industrial designer : alright . marketing : alright . project manager : yeah ? okay . user interface : this is my suggested design . project manager : well , okay , alright . um then let 's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . user interface : um yes . and oh i think as you can see so , the lcd screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . project manager : i 'd i agree . user interface : but marketing : yeah , fine . project manager : fine . industrial designer : well yeah yeah yeah . marketing : move on . project manager : yeah . user interface : oh , um i had some uh examples . project manager : industrial designer : i can live with it . user interface : you can uh but i did not like it very much , but marketing : user interface : well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote . um project manager : too big . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : they do they do n't look fruity enough . user interface : no , well th marketing : nei they 're n they 're not trendy . project manager : they 're all black . user interface : yeah . well not all . project manager : hey , that one i like . user interface : uh this is for children but th industrial designer : tho yeah those marketing : it does n't look strong . user interface : no . industrial designer : but it does n't uh the project manager : the remote . user interface : w but with the colours i it 's a bit the way we 're going to . industrial designer : yeah , ok yeah . marketing : yeah right . user interface : well this is a terrible project manager : terrible . marketing : this is just crazy . industrial designer : but it it must not look too childish of course huh ? project manager : it 's it 's all too much buttons . user interface : um this looks project manager : too many buttons . that 's user interface : yeah . this uh these are the lcd screens . i think we should , if it 's um possible , uh one with colours , but marketing : nah th it 's too expensive . user interface : i do n't know uh project manager : well , that 's too expensive i think . user interface : too expensive ? alright . marketing : yeah . project manager : alright . yeah . user interface : well nah . industrial designer : but it yeah . project manager : okay . huh . user interface : ha , even more . n project manager : mm no . 'kay . marketing : but are we going for a strange uh form ? project manager : no , not very strange . marketing : 'cause people like that . industrial designer : not not too strange . no . marketing : not too strange . project manager : it still has t marketing : you can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the lcd is . project manager : yes . th a a kind of bridge . so it f falls over the hand . user interface : well marketing : i dunno if you know the no nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that . project manager : yeah ? yeah ? yeah . marketing : you know ? project manager : well i have at home a remote with a bridge . it 's just a half round half half circle at and then it falls exactly over the hand , and that 's very nice . that 's it feels comfortable . marketing : yeah , but people like something uh new you know . industrial designer : exotic yeah . marketing : yeah , different . industrial designer : we have t yeah , yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i will design it , we design it later . so we 'll get to that later i guess . marketing : alright . great . project manager : yeah , alright . um where did i put it ? um conceptual phase , i think this is it . industrial designer : the specific shape . the user interface : project manager : i got this from our friends . user interface : project manager : so uh yeah the conceptual design . industrial designer : our sources . project manager : these are a few examples which we have to decide about . all the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that 's all your uh your side of the story . um marketing : your bag . project manager : yeah . um now from the user interface , your uh package ? um where no well , that 's more like the buttons where they have to come . and um b a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design . user interface : yeah , this is what we 've just done . right ? project manager : yes , but we have to decide about these now . industrial designer : but uh we should decide now . user interface : ah right . marketing : yeah . project manager : and uh the trend-watching . marketing : materials are the most , most impor project manager : so as you said , fruity is in , well sells good . user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : uh these things . industrial designer : so we have to uh put it in one uh document . project manager : uh yes . um so if we uh go through them industrial designer : copy paste uh this story into a into a word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . yeah . project manager : user interface : not everything . industrial designer : well we have to decide all these things ? user interface : yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine . project manager : yeah well uh why should i uh industrial designer : w we can uh override them ? marketing : project manager : yeah . marketing : project manager : so industrial designer : well a case ? uh that 's me . uh i suggest well what do i suggest actually ? project manager : what what kind of properties should it have ? well we just listened . industrial designer : uh s solid , user interface : i think we industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : why do n't we um use uh titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . marketing : do you know the new uh user interface : that just like um most cell phones are . industrial designer : yeah , i understand . marketing : no no industrial designer : yeah . so we have titanium . marketing : the front is the most important . industrial designer : yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : to give that uh strong look . project manager : you know what ? industrial designer : and then the front is made of plastic . and you can put that on and off , and switch it . user interface : yeah . marketing : but the feel of plastic is n't strong . industrial designer : no but you have titanium of course . user interface : no but you you have this yeah . industrial designer : uh you have the best of both worlds . marketing : yeah alright , alright . 'kay . user interface : yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . so you feel titanium . industrial designer : and of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . but you also have the titanium . marketing : yeah . fronts are are cheaper than when they 're from plas user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah of course , but yeah you have to make a decision . user interface : and i do n't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . marketing : yeah , but it it 's expensive . industrial designer : i guess so . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh titanium i sh i think uh marketing : bendable . industrial designer : huh ? well , well the marketing : bendable . user interface : well any colour industrial designer : according to my sources , uh it 's it 's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want . user interface : yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . the plastic is is the colour you want it . marketing : yeah . paint spray . yeah alright . user interface : so yeah . project manager : alright . marketing : so , we 're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? project manager : i 've uh industrial designer : yeah , project manager : titanium back , plastic front . industrial designer : i think that 's a nice trade-off . project manager : okay . um well i am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look . marketing : yeah , great . project manager : i um solid feel and trendy look . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : alright . project manager : so material , um hard plastic for the front ? industrial designer : yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : for the non-removable uh part . marketing : but then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you ca n't switch it . when you want an other colour on the front , it does n't match . user interface : well titanium is neutral . industrial designer : well but marketing : you know ? industrial designer : the titan titanium is n't is n't v very yeah , i it does n't uh curves . marketing : i understand . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : no uh i nei . titanium is very no no no , but you know b titanium is very basic colour , marketing : yeah , yeah , yeah . yeah . industrial designer : and it does n't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i dunno if if you disagree , marketing : alright . user interface : well industrial designer : but i think it 's does n't matter very much . user interface : our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , marketing : yeah . alright . user interface : and they do n't use uh wood . marketing : funky customers . industrial designer : and even if it does uh does n't match , it will uh people like mm colours that do n't match . user interface : mm . yeah . project manager : okay . and well marketing : alright . project manager : the the electrical cable is just normal uh . industrial designer : cop copper uh material . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : excuse me ? marketing : user interface : the electrical cable uh does industrial designer : project manager : it 's uh from uh our coffee uh industrial designer : yeah copper i just a ba basic uh user interface : no we do n't use an electrical cable . project manager : user interface : yeah inside , but this is for the coffee uh machine . industrial designer : yeah in project manager : industrial designer : yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh project manager : of course . user interface : yeah , but that 's not what 's meant here , i think . marketing : so external . user interface : industrial designer : oh external ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : well a coffee grind does n't have na ja . never mind the coffee grind . project manager : well uh marketing : project manager : all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work . so industrial designer : right ? marketing : project manager : the chip is normal silicon . industrial designer : project manager : uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . marketing : project manager : okay ? so that 's just easy . industrial designer : alright . mm-hmm . project manager : uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes . the conceptual specification of the user interface ?
