    "answer": "hefin david am : the last thing from me : the \u00a34.50 single national rate\u2014is there a danger that we might be creating a kind of easyjet-style nursery provision where you get the basics but the wealthier parents are going to be able to pay for better care within those settings because of the add-ons ? huw irranca-davies am : we really mulled over this a lot and discussed it , i have to say , not only internally but with childcare providers out there and with parents as well and with local authorities . the first thing to say is the \u00a34.50 rate that we 've set has been welcomed , and it 's been welcomed because it 's unlike the much more complex offer that 's in england , where there 's a variable rate and there are lots of determining factors on it and it 's added complexity and confusion . hefin david am : can i just ask there , it 's been welcomed perhaps in blaenau gwent , but has it been equally welcomed in cardiff ? huw irranca-davies am : no , because we have n't rolled it out in cardiff yet , and that is a salient point . hefin david am : okay , fair enough . but will it be , then ? huw irranca-davies am : yes , it will be . some of the more expensive areas like cardiff and newport are knocking on our door saying , 'please can we have this offer ? ' , and we are keen to give it to them . but , as i say\u2014 hefin david am : but do you anticipate a capacity problem with the \u00a34.50 in those areas , compared to , say , the cynon valley ? huw irranca-davies am : we ca n't anticipate it yet , hefin , but that 's exactly the reason for going into that area and then assessing how it works . we 're reasonably confident that the \u00a34.50\u2014 . we 're reasonably assured by the feedback that we 're having that the \u00a34.50 might work as a universal amount . but if we learn , when we roll it out in cardiff and newport , that there needs to be some variation , we can look at that , because we 're not doing a big-bang approach . so , that is part of why we will move to roll it out within cardiff and newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it , but at the moment , i have to say , the \u00a34.50 amount has been welcomed\u2014it 's appropriate . you touched on the other aspect , though , of the wider aspects of beyond the \u00a34.50 , because the \u00a34.50 does n't cover everything . the \u00a34.50 is a contribution towards the wraparound childcare element but it does n't cover\u2014and we agonised over this\u2014the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this . now , we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are . i have to say , this has n't been ivory-tower stuff ; it 's been in discussion with the providers but also parents . one : parents are quite used to\u2014with childcare settings and play care settings and so on\u2014the idea that providers are quite different . some providers charge a fee that does everything in one ; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents\u2014and i 'm used to this as a parent myself , although mine are older now\u2014'mr irranca-davies , when you sign on , just to be aware , if we do take your kids down to st fagans , there 's going to be a little bit of a charge for that ' and so on . hefin david am : that 's fair enough , but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that , because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons , the lower income ones wo n't . is n't that a concern ? huw irranca-davies am : if money was absolutely no object , then i think you 'd be looking at quite a different offer , but it has to be affordable within what we 've got as well . the fact that parents , including those who are on lower incomes , are used to currently discriminating between providers , not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well , where very often schools now will say , 'we 're doing something extra'\u2014 hefin david am : that may be the case , but it 's not fair , is it ? huw irranca-davies am : in a pure argument about equity , and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money\u2014'you can do what you want'\u2014i think you 'd be looking at a very different approach . but within what we have , i think this works very , very well indeed , because it 's very transparent for parents who are used to making these decisions . it says , 'here you have 10 hours of the foundation education offer . you have the additional hours here provided with the childcare offer . but within those additional hours , you may be with a local provider in the middle of powys that actually says , `` within that we provide everything '' ; you may be with a provider that says , `` well , actually , we do a whistles and bells thing and we take them out on trips , but it 's up to you if you want to come , and here 's the additional cost\u2014 '' . ' parents are used to making that decision and realistically , in terms of what we can do with this offer , this is actually\u2014the arguments around this have been well rehearsed both with providers and with parents and we 're not getting any concerns that this is going to unnecessarily disadvantage . in a total fairness argument , would you make it universal and with no additional charges ? well , possibly you would . but we work within the realistic\u2014 hefin david am : or have a lower top-end income limit . huw irranca-davies am : depending on how the bill progresses in the main chamber and when it goes through committee , there 's that flexibility built into the bill that those things can be looked at over time and adjusted . for the moment , i think there is an attraction , in terms of the upper limit , of saying : one\u2014'let 's try not to add additional complexity , let 's go with a scheme that 's already working its way through the system , which is , if you like , what they 're doing in england , and not add additional complexity . but , secondly , there is an appeal to universality , curiously , in saying to all parents\u2014and i say this regardless of political hues across the committee here\u2014there 's an attraction when you say , 'let 's make an offer focused on working parents as it is ' , as universal to those working parents as possible , and avoid the administrative costs of saying , 'well , let 's take the upper limit down to \u00a380 or \u00a360 or \u00a355 . ' there 's always the question of how much additional cost is incurred in actually doing that tweak of complexity . we have looked at it . lynne neagle am : darren on this . darren millar am : just to ask , i mean , the labour market costs are changing , are n't they ? you 've got the national living wage increasing\u2014 [ inaudible . ] \u2014that 's going to have a bearing , is n't it , on the affordability of this project in terms of the childcare offer and the suitability of the \u00a34.50 per hour regime ? by the time it 's fully rolled out , of course , that \u00a34.50 rate is going to be a number of years old , for example . do you have plans to review that ? where is it headed ? because it 's certainly not going to be enough in the future . huw irranca-davies am : it depends how far in the future you 're looking . i have to say , the feedback that we 're having at the moment from organisations like the professional association for childcare and early years and from the national day nurseries association wales and others is that this is the right rate and it 's suitable not only today but for the foreseeable future of rolling this out . darren millar am : but they 've raised concerns about the national living wage implications , have n't they , as well ? huw irranca-davies am : of course , and i think it 's incumbent on us as well to not\u2014 darren millar am : so , it 's not fair to say that they have n't raised concerns about the rate . huw irranca-davies am : yes , but what they 're not arguing for at the moment is for this rate to be raised . darren millar am : but they have suggested that in meetings\u2014 huw irranca-davies am : that in future\u2014 darren millar am : absolutely . huw irranca-davies am : well , of course , in future , any minister , any committee , will want to come back and look at\u2014is the hourly rate , as one element of the scheme , appropriate to the current financial challenges for the sector , and not least , by the way , as we try not only to develop the workforce , but to develop the career pathways through this as well ? and i think that 's the right discussion to be had , live time , as this is taken forward . but at this moment in time , we 're not getting people saying within this part of the roll-out that we need to adjust this amount . darren millar am : so , have you forecasted for any adjustment in the rate going forward in terms of affordability of the project ? because you 've still got this \u00a3100 million price tag on it , have n't you ? huw irranca-davies am : similar to the point that was raised with hefin about cardiff and newport , if we identify that the rate is not appropriate , if it's\u2014 . i do n't think anybody 's going to come back to us and say that it 's too little . but do bear in mind that it 's above where the average england rate is , even though there 's this complex variability within the english rate that has caused some confusion there , which is why the universal rate with us has been welcomed . if we find , as we pilot it , or if we find because there are more expensive areas for it to be delivered in , there needs to be adjustment , then we 'll be back in front of the committee arguing why that needs to be the case . darren millar am : but that wo n't put the project at risk in terms of its finances ? huw irranca-davies am : no , no . we are still very confident , looking forward , on the best projections we have , fed by the live input that 's coming in from the pilot , which will be fed again in the autumn\u2014the arad report coming forward\u2014that we have not only the capacity to actually deliver this\u2014challenging as this is , we have the capacity to deliver it\u2014but also that the funding that 's available , on our best estimate\u2014the estimate we 've stood by , that broad ball park of that \u00a3100 million figure\u2014it 's deliverable within that . but if it changes , we will come back . and if it changes , i 'll have to be sitting down with my boss , vaughan gething , and with mark drakeford , to argue the case on it . but at this moment , we have confidence and we 've run the rule across this repeatedly . but that rate , combined with the other elements of this childcare offer\u2014there is sufficient there allocated to actually deliver the whole roll-out . lynne neagle am : mark on this . mark reckless am : minister , as a parent who 's been researching childcare options , it 's obvious to me that in cardiff , and to a degree in newport and monmouthshire , costs are substantially higher than this , and i haven't been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for \u00a327 , which is implied by your rate . is n't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you 're going to need a higher rate to make it work ? is n't that already obvious ? why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future ? huw irranca-davies am : chair , my biggest fear is a parent who 's actually involved in this area already , but , having been one myself\u2014 . mark , you may be right , that 's exactly why we 're piloting it and that 's why when we pilot in cardiff and newport , we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability and the \u00a34.50 per hour rate . mark reckless am : but you 're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that i 've referred to . huw irranca-davies am : no . we will be . we are going to be . mark reckless am : when are you starting ? huw irranca-davies am : cardiff and newport\u2014september . owain lloyd : this september . mark reckless am : this september ? huw irranca-davies am : yes . so , we 're not missing any of these learning experiences and we know that\u2014 . the reason we 've gone for the other areas first , by the way\u2014please take this back to any authorities affected\u2014is simply because we 've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid wales , areas in north wales , areas around welsh language provision , areas in deep valleys , understanding the cultural and the economic impacts . so , we 've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision . but it 's coming , it 's imminent , and we 'll learn the lessons from it . and do you know , you may be right ? and if you are right , that it 's more expensive , and we need a higher rate within those areas , then we 're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee . but let 's go in and learn it first of all , rather than assume it necessarily . lynne neagle am : just before i bring david in on the issue that hefin raised about the chargeable items , your paper says that providers can charge up to \u00a37.50 a day for food , snacks , transport and consumables such as nappies . now , that 's \u00a337.50 a week , which is a lot of money for parents , and i just wondered if you wanted to comment on that figure ? but also , do you think there 's a risk that providers who maybe are n't charging at the moment may start charging because of any new pressures that arise because of this scheme ? huw irranca-davies am : i think they 're the right areas to flag up , and if i thought that was going to happen i 'd be concerned as we take this forward and design this scheme . i think part of the evaluation from arad will also show us that\u2014whether or not , within the pilot areas that we are already in , which are quite diverse , that is happening . we 're only one term into learning the lessons , by the way , but i would want to make sure that we design a scheme where we are not heaping on disadvantage or where there was exploitation of disadvantaged families . so , the early evaluation , i think , will give us good feedback on that . i think also , by the way , that providers know that this is a collaborative effort to do this here . it 's not in their interests , i have to say , as the umbrella bodies or individual providers , to see this as some way that they can unduly rake in additional income from this on the backs of poorer families . this is about providing opportunities for all working families . but especially , i have to say , the early evaluation that we 've seen already suggests that the greatest proportion of those who are taking advantage of this scheme in the early parts\u2014in the early evaluation\u2014are those who are below the average working wage within in wales . that 's by far the greatest number of people who are doing it , and we do n't want them then being priced out because of add-ons . so , there has to be some pragmatism , i have to say , and some open partnership working here with the sector , and we do have that . lynne neagle am : john on this . john griffiths am : i want to come back to the \u00a34.50 rate , but in terms of working with the sector , briefly , if i might , chair , i just wonder , huw , in terms of that \u00a34.50 figure and understanding the sector in wales , to what extent are we talking about a market rate and to what extent are we talking about the increase in demand that will come from the scheme and how that relates to economies of scale and capacity ? is it purely a market rate or is there a conversation with the sector in terms of the benefits that will come from this scheme and how they should be recognised in terms of setting the rate ? huw irranca-davies am : this has been a very open dialogue with the sector around affordability , around the hourly rate and around what might happen in future as well . this is not a pure hard data-driven analysis that says , 'here we 've calculated everything and this is the rate that will satisfy it ' , because we recognise that there 's great diversity in provision out there , and we also recognise that things will change over time . it 's not only the geographical diversity\u2014it 's the diversity of the sector itself . i think we need to , as we take this scheme forward and look at the full roll-out , continue in that very open dialogue with the sector not about what is purely a market-driven amount but actually what is also affordable for the welsh government within the constraints that we have . just to flag up one issue , it 's right that we 're focusing on those elements that are n't included within it , to some extent as well , and the effect of that on more disadvantaged families , but that has to be balanced with the pocket of affordability for this scheme as well . let me give you a clear illustration : some of our calculations have suggested that if we included free food within this offer as well , it would add something like in the region of 50p to that \u00a34.50 rate . that would have , at this moment , impacts on the affordability of this and the roll-out of it . i would need to be going back to my seniors and arguing the case now , okay ? but , it 's that open dialogue with the sector that says , 'there 's one thing about what you 're saying you demand as a market ; there 's another thing about what we 're saying that we have affordability from taxpayers ' money to actually put into this ' . they also understand , john , that as well as an enabling policy\u2014and we 're seeing the evidence , by the way ; i can cite it\u2014of individuals who are being helped into more flexible options to get back into work , increase their hours and so on , this is also about building capacity in a fundamental foundation sector that is in every single part of wales . the stuff that 's being debated ad nauseam here within the assembly about foundational sectors\u2014 . the sector itself understands that if we boost the childcare offer in all its diversity , including , by the way , not just the independent sector but social enterprises and third-sector organisations , such as exist in neath and elsewhere that i was involved in 20 or 30-odd years ago setting up\u2014that has an economic impact that goes beyond that immediate family who are receiving the provision to the wider communities as well . they know that . they know there is job creation within this and there 's economic impact for that . so , it 's an open dialogue on what the rate should be rather than purely , 'our wonks have crunched the numbers and we 've come up with \u00a34.50 . ' lynne neagle am : david , you had a question on the pilots . david rees am : yes , just to finish that section off , if i may , chair . before i go to my question , i want to come back to mark reckless 's question and the answer you gave . i got the impression that if there is a need to look at different rates because of the higher-end areas , you may therefore have different sets of rates and not a universal rate . is that also on the cards ? huw irranca-davies am : david , it 's possible . i think our preference would be , i have to say , to stick with the universal rate , because we know it's\u2014 . there 's real simplicity and it 's been welcomed in the sector . but the sector , also , are quite pragmatic about this . one of the defining hallmarks of the way that we 've taken this scheme forward is learning in live time as we pilot and expand the pilots into different areas and different types of provision . if we learn lessons from that that suggest we need to come back and look at a differential in more-expensive-to-provide areas , then we 'll have to look at that , but there might be other ways of splicing it . but first of all , i think we have to go in and see how does this work . we might find , mark , we might find , david , that we go in and when everything is tallied up , the \u00a34.50 per hour works in supporting provision there . david rees am : okay . in your answer to john , you talked about affordability , which i totally understand . if i can now remind you : i do n't remember the word 'affordability ' coming in the manifesto pledge of the government . it was 'we will offer childcare facilities ' . so , i just want to put a reminder to you there ."
