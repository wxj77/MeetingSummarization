    "answer": "project manager : so um now i think it 's the turn of the the i 'm not sure um marketing : project manager : of the technical function , so uh marketing : so i think it 's you , huh ? industrial designer : uh it 's marketing : no ? user interface : that 's me . project manager : what effect industrial designer : techni function of marketing : no , user requiremen industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . wait a second . marketing : project manager : argh . industrial designer : i have to do working design so uh project manager : so you 're user interface : that 's but this but number three , yes . mm-hmm . so , my name is mark dwight , and um i am responsible for user interface design . marketing : user interface : however , uh mm project manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . uh , as i 'm a more an artist marketing : project manager : user interface : that 's gon na be less technical functions but more user interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . project manager : okay . let 's go . user interface : so next slide please . and uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task marketing : user interface : is not to forget about uh occam razor . we should never complicate things too much . we should only make a remote control , nothing more . nothing more than this , just a remote control . marketing : project manager : user interface : 'cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . marketing : makes sense . user interface : so , make a click , please . so here is this remote control . marketing : project manager : user interface : it 's quite a standard one , but it 's not from a tv , it 's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . but you know , we can use it for a tv easily . only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one marketing : industrial designer : it 's user interface : which one would you prefer ? i guess this . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : i would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh i find the buttons that i need every time i need a button . user interface : sure , sure . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : industrial designer : maybe it can be yeah middle of like , between those two user interface : yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple project manager : oh sorry . user interface : simple desires into simple actions . marketing : nice . nice sentence . user interface : findings . project manager : okay . marketing : project manager : oh sorry . user interface : our question of the style , we should remember that our company marketing : user interface : puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it . marketing : project manager : user interface : concept . industrial designer : s you should yeah . user interface : be simple . be simple and you 'll lean on this market . industrial designer : user interface : market is a of remote controls you know it better , it 's very well , it 's it 's not an easy field to to play , you know ? so be simple . marketing : user interface : for personal preferences i think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : user interface : it 's a really good style , it going to be look like like this . it is unbreakable and it is very universal . w we 'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and we can put all the options into this screen . we 'll need only few buttons . all the other things can be controlled through the screen . and all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . so press i would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium i think , and uh what else ? i got just very few and good ideas . we need power and volume . and let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . when you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the tv , project manager : it 's off . it 's on . user interface : the tv turns on . marketing : and when does it turn off ? user interface : when you do n't touch the control but you go out of the for for enough time marketing : oh so you have a user interface : like uh you marketing : sensing sensor machine that uh knows user interface : it 's a question to our technical design , our two engineers . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : tech user interface : and another nice feature that i would like to implement is uh volume control . suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . project manager : or you want to go to the kitchen . user interface : it 's easy to do , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : you just control the marketing : according to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . industrial designer : distance . user interface : according to the distance . yeah yeah yeah . so marketing : uh i 'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? uh is it a touch screen by the way ? user interface : i think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . user interface : so , its main purpose in fact is a back light , industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : which change colours , marketing : okay . user interface : which makes it easier to find , and each can it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ? marketing : okay . user interface : so basically that 's it . project manager : um i see that you target uh several s application not only tv but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control . user interface : can be easily done , project manager : yeah . user interface : 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions . let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . you want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : just few actions , a few actions for everything . project manager : hmm . s user interface : all the rest , we sh we 'll put it into this menu on the screen . project manager : mm . since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control i think we will only concentrate on tv for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah . user interface : okay , okay . industrial designer : mm . yeah and it mm . user interface : okay , but it 's quite universal you know . we can just extend it to any device . marketing : so for instance if i want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would i do can i do that with this ? user interface : uh twenty five . marketing : yeah mm let 's say i am uh on channel eight now . you know these days we have hundreds of channels , user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : that 's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . user interface : in fact i would propose another solution . marketing : or is it ? user interface : basically you use just four or five channels , right ? marketing : most people user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : so uh set up your tv set like channels that you use they 're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . marketing : in fact in in one uh remote control that i 've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that i want to by cycled with my next button . project manager : yeah it 's it 's the same solution , i think . hmm . marketing : i uh industrial designer : yeah . marketing : b yeah . industrial designer : but even we can have some uh lcd display , like you can uh de you can just button the number marketing : go to channel twenty five . industrial designer : and then it go marketing : one thing is that as i said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . industrial designer : t because yeah . marketing : so even if they are only watching four or five channels , i think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but still yeah . marketing : just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping . project manager : yeah uh on zap it 's only next next next next next , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and it 's only next . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : mm . we got these buttons here . next next . marketing : so but you have to project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah . . user interface : or say this can be back . industrial designer : yeah . but otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five marketing : so it would be industrial designer : and then marketing : okay . project manager : maybe we can make uh different modes for each button industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and you can change mode zapping mode or industrial designer : yeah . yeah , yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . alright . project manager : uh current chan industrial designer : yeah , yeah . yeah but since we are focusing only on tv remote controls marketing : listening more . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so we can have more functions for tv marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . user interface : could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ? marketing : well i could could uh have a look at that maybe . project manager : user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : i 'll check in my department if there 's someone specialist in that . user interface : okay . project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : although i do n't know . user interface : alright ? thanks for your attention ."
