    "answer": "the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : now we 'll go to the honourable member for hamilton mountain , mr. duvall . mr. scott duvall ( hamilton mountain , ndp ) : mr . chair , i was pleased to hear about extending the tax deadline to october 1 in yesterday 's announcement for seniors . after many discussions with the minister of seniors , i was glad to hear that she was listening to the ndp and many others on making this happen . it stops a lot of interruptions for people who could n't get their taxes done . mr . chair , covid-19 has been showing us in stark terms that canadian seniors are struggling to make ends meet in canada . before enduring the crisis , it was clear that oas and gis benefits levels were just not enough for seniors to keep up with the cost of living , so we need to fix this now . why is the government refusing to increase oas and gis benefits to lift seniors out of poverty on a permanent basis ? hon . deb schulte ( minister of seniors ) : mr . chair , i want to thank my honourable colleague for giving me this opportunity to rise today and talk about how we are supporting canadian seniors during this pandemic . many canadian seniors are facing significant health , economic and social challenges as a result of the pandemic . they built this country and now they need our help . our government is taking significant action to provide canadian seniors with greater financial security and give them the help they need during this crisis . we 're building on past measures by introducing a one-time tax-free payment of $ 300 for those who receive oas and of $ 200 for those receiving gis , totalling $ 500 to seniors who receive both . we are also supporting community-based projects to improve the quality of life for seniors through the new horizons for seniors program , and investing in other charities . seniors need our help , and we are delivering for them ."
