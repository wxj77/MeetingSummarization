    "answer": "janet finch-saunders am : thank you . can you set out the picture regarding children 's residential care ? what are the challenges these care settings are facing , and have any children 's homes closed ? julie morgan am : residential children 's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues , and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened . so , i 'm very pleased to report that . we obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported , and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings , and that is going on , although it may be by technology rather than face to face . we know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge , and i think it \u2019 s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult . so , there have been a few issues related to that , but , where that has happened , local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis , and really there are not any major issues . in terms of residential care , hillside is functioning well\u2014no reporting issues . the staffing levels are normal . there are fewer children and young people there , so , in fact , there 's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children , and i think we 've had very good reports about how that has happened . so , i am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be . i also meet with the children 's commissioner once a week , who is an independent source , and she said when i met her last week , 'well , as far as we know , it 's all good news ' . so , i do n't think we have any concerns at the moment about the residential care . janet finch-saunders am : okay . moving on to foster care , how is welsh government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the association of fostering and adoption cymru and its fostering guidelines ? julie morgan am : we have worked with the fostering organisations . we have had close communications with them , and we 've supported afa cymru to develop guidance for foster carers , and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector . we 're working with the third sector . i think i mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and , of course , care leavers . the fostering network has extended its helpline hours , and , of course , voices from care\u2014i mentioned them before\u2014have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers . i 've been reassured , as well , from voices from care that the young people appear to be more stable now\u2014that they have contact with . but that 's online help for them . so , we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services . janet finch-saunders am : so , the final point on that , then : the fostering network and others , as you know , have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer , with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses . what is your position on this , please ? julie morgan am : well , we have n't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers , but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people , i believe , have increased the amount of money that they are paying . they 've also given support for various activities and things\u2014have helped sometimes , i think , with broadband access and that sort of issue . and , obviously , foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency ."
