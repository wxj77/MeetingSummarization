    "answer": "ms. iqra khalid ( mississaugaerin mills , lib . ) : thank you , mr . chair . i 'll be splitting my time with the member for pickeringuxbridge . mr . chair , when the women and men of the canadian armed forces stepped in to provide support to five long-term care homes in ontario at the request of the premier , they released a report that outlined their findings in detail . military members witnessed residents ' cries for help going unanswered . they saw force-feeding . they saw bug infestations , a lack of personal protective equipment and neglect . canadians are shaken . they are appalled by the horrific conditions outlined in the military report . almost 1,000 seniors so far have lost their lives in long-term care homes in ontario alone , over 25 of them in my riding of mississaugaerin mills . these deaths could have been prevented . can the minister of health please update the house on how our federal government is working with the provinces and territories to prevent further tragic occurrences from happening at long-term care homes and to ensure that our most vulnerable seniors are properly looked after and cared for ? hon . patty hajdu : mr . chair , it 's such an important question . i believe all canadians were deeply horrified to read the details from the canadian armed forces on the conditions in long-term care homes in ontario . what 's happening to seniors in ontario is completely unacceptable . the report is very troubling . seniors deserve to live with dignity , with respect and with safety . while long-term care is provincially regulated , we know that we need to work together . the government of canada stands ready to support provinces and territories as they continue to respond to this crisis . i had a very good conversation with my provincial and territorial counterparts last night about the work we can do at a national level to support their important work . we also know that seniors want to stay at home longer . that 's why our historic investment of $ 6 billion in home care was so important . we 'll continue to work with the provinces and territories to ensure that they get the care and dignity they deserve . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll go now to ms. o'connell . ms. jennifer o'connell ( pickeringuxbridge , lib . ) : thank you , mr . chair . i will sadly report that my community of pickering has experienced the largest number of deaths at a single covid-19 outbreak location anywhere in this country . seventy residents at orchard villa long-term care home died during this pandemic . it was a devastating blow to our community . yesterday , we received the horrific report from the canadian armed forces detailing what they witnessed at orchard villa in pickering , altamont care community in scarborough , eatonville care centre in etobicoke , hawthorne place in north york , and holland christian homes ' grace manor in brampton . the loved ones of those who have passed away , as well as the homes ' workers , have asked for a full public inquiry from the ontario government . i know that the responsibility for these facilities falls within provincial jurisdiction , but on behalf of our communities , can the minister of health update us on the work she is doing to ensure that the ontario government takes action immediately and initiates a full , independent , non-partisan public inquiry and reverses its decision to create a government-led commission that wo n't even start until september ? hon . patty hajdu : mr . chair , i would say that all canadians were shocked and horrified to hear about the conditions that existed in these particular care homes . we 're so grateful to the members of the armed forces who not only improved conditions but also reported them quickly and appropriately to ensure amelioration of those conditions for those particular individuals . we also know that there are seniors all across the country who are struggling with care and with the appropriate level of care . we have to do better as a country . these are our loved ones . these are our parents and our grandparents . these are the people in our lives who have given so much to us . i stand committed to working with my provincial and territorial counterparts to ensure that we do better as a society . we know that there 's a role we can play at the federal level with advice , with guidance , with support and , yes , with investments . we look forward to having those conversations about how best we can improve the care for all seniors amongst us ."
