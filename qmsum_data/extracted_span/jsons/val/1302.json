    "query": "<s> what did the meeting discuss about universities that had secured funding for investing in their estates ?",
    "answer": "bethan owen : and , there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates . so , for example , cardiff university have had a bond rather than borrowing , which you draw down as you 're spending . so , in the short term , the reserves of cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances , but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and , over the next two or three years , will be utilised for that . angela burns am : so , overall , you 're painting a picture of a sector that 's under a significant degree of financial stress , and this is obviously using your key financial indicators . do you monitor each and every university , or do you wait for them to come back and tell you what their situation is ? bethan owen : we monitor , we receive forecasts , five-year forecasts , and we meet frequently with all our universities now . it varies , depending on the risks of the universities , as to how frequently we meet , but we 're actually meeting with every university because even the forecast that we received last july , the changes , even in the 12-month period , are significant enough for us to need a better understanding of what the latest position is . the forecasts , if i just run through\u2014 . we had a sector that , in 2017-18 , had a deficit . although it had a turnover and income of \u00a31.5 billion , which had increased , nonetheless it had a small deficit of 0.4 per cent of income in 2017-18 , which was an improvement on the deficit the year before of 1.7 per cent , but notably , again , the sector in england were looking at surpluses of 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the same period . the forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that , for 2018-19 , we should have a sector that 's roughly in a break-even position , but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in july , where there will have to be a reflection of the pension costs , and there have been significant changes in pension costs , both for the teachers ' pension scheme and the universities ' superannuation scheme as well , and those will be significant costs that universities have to build into their forecasts at a time when their income , certainly their fee income , is not increasing , and that is the challenge . angela burns am : are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years ?"
