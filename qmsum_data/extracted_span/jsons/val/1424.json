    "answer": "project manager : okay . well , let 's start . what are we doing ? oops . industrial designer : ah , pinball . project manager : okay . okay . not doing . industrial designer : user interface : industrial designer : marketing : mm . ah . hey . ah . project manager : uh marketing : now i have my screen back too . project manager : very good . industrial designer : project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : we have presentations . so first , it 's your turn . user interface : mine . oh , great . project manager : yeah . is n't it amazing . industrial designer : huh . marketing : yeah . very interesting . user interface : uh marketing : industrial designer : user interface : project manager : industrial designer . interface concept . user interface : yes , well uh let 's uh talk about the interface uh concept . uh , first i 'll uh i 'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . and uh my personal preferences . well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . the bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . the channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . and the menu menu button to man manipulate the lcd uh display . um , i found some uh interesting uh uh samples . examples . industrial designer : user interface : um , well uh what 's pretty standard is uh that it 's that they 're all pretty uh uh high uh marketing : large . user interface : yeah . yeah . large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . marketing : a lot a lot of buttons buttons . user interface : um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . like there . and uh yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . and what 's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we do n't use that . but uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . uh this is the v_ for volume , but they 're both uh a v_ . project manager : user interface : so it 's it 's not really very uh clear what 's the function of that . marketing : yeah . user interface : um yeah . so , that 's project manager : can you go back one page ? for the uh menu , what do we use for that ? we do n't have buttons for the menu . user interface : uh , well project manager : or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel . user interface : yeah . i thought that was our uh idea . project manager : okay . but uh user interface : so , uh how project manager : you have to put it on the user interface : like this . project manager : yeah . user interface : or or this . and that the menu button is okay . project manager : yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . user interface : yeah , okay . uh , so the the icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . project manager : mm-hmm . yes . the second one . user interface : yeah . uh , well that 's something to uh think about . project manager : okay . industrial designer : uh , maybe i 'll have something in my uh presentation . and you will see it . user interface : okay . marketing : okay . user interface : um , well i do n't i do n't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . industrial designer : user interface : but uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , i would uh recommend a yellow case . uh , round edges . the logo at the bottom . and uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . so , it 's good . uh , recognisable . k so , i think . project manager : not too much colours . user interface : uh , no . not too much . project manager : no , it 's not flower power . user interface : but uh no , no , no . but this has to be has to be trendy and uh and project manager : s okay . user interface : uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . project manager : okay . user interface : that was that . project manager : thank you . so , you 're next . industrial designer : i 'm next , okay . yes . no . here we go . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : uh , at first we will uh i will f uh say something about what younger people want , marketing : okay . project manager : marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . and then , i 'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . first uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . like , totally yellow , totally red . uh , so it 's visible . uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . maybe it 's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . but to give him the shape of your hand , so you it 's easier to use or something like that . but that 's just an idea . and then , i 'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . the battery , there are few options . uh , i think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . so , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . when you uh shake it a few times , it it 's loaded . uh , the the form of the remote control , i think it 's also nice have it curved . and maybe like it 's hand-shaped . uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . uh material , you use plastic . hard plastic uh because uh it wo n't have to burst uh like in the in one time . and also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . uh the push-buttons . we have one new thing uh discovered . it 's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . maybe it 's uh easy to use uh for the channels . when you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wan na see the next , uh if you wan na see that channel . and also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it 's also uh easy to use . just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . and that 's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . you can do it with your thumb . and with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one , you can see channel one . the electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . there are also uh simple chips . they are uh cheaper . um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and i think there are a lot of those uh things , and people wo n't buy it any more . they have seen enough of it . and you have also advanced um chips . but that 's with the lcd uh screen . and the costs will increase a lot more . and i think our budget is too low to use and an lcd , and the chip who is more expensive . and maybe it 's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . you have any more questions about this ? i think the main thing is we look at the costs . and not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has . marketing : yeah . but , thi i uh this is with an lcd ? no , industrial designer : not with an lcd . project manager : no , is n't . but the lcd is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . industrial designer : yeah . but then , what i say , the costs will uh get a lot higher . project manager : but then it 's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . if you do n't industrial designer : th then you 'll see it on the television . project manager : hmm , yes . but then . yeah , then you go one down one up . when you scroll . industrial designer : but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it 's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . yeah project manager : but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . yeah so you may not be uh industrial designer : project manager : no . the television must do that . so industrial designer : mm-hmm . yeah , i think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . project manager : yeah but young people have to have all their uh room . and mostly they are smaller . so industrial designer : yes . but that wo n't be a problem . i think . project manager : most the times that are not advanced televisions . industrial designer : no , but then we 'll get to the regular uh remote controls . marketing : industrial designer : and i think , what i said , everybody has them uh has them already . and they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two euros . uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . and i think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . project manager : okay . marketing : uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with lcd or without ? industrial designer : i got it on my screen and it was uh higher . but i do n't know uh how much higher . marketing : 'cause it project manager : that 's important . marketing : i think if we have an lcd , it will also sell a lot better . industrial designer : that 's true . marketing : and that might uh bring back the costs uh industrial designer : but then we 'll i think we must discuss who uh what will be better . if we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . with a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a lcd . and then a flat um remote control . or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without lcd . project manager : yeah . maybe you can look how how much it is for the lcd . industrial designer : i can uh look on my uh project manager : it 's very important . industrial designer : uh note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . a scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . the display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . project manager : yeah , more expensive . but how much ? user interface : industrial designer : does n't say . project manager : oh . okay . industrial designer : that 's from my manufacturing division . project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : 'kay . project manager : well , thank you . marketing : my turn ? project manager : next . industrial designer : marketing : mm . so so yeah . so , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . uh , i did some trend-watching . it 's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . 'cause if you do n't , you wo n't sell . so , well how we did do that ? uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by trendwatchers . they uh watch in uh cities like uh paris and milan . of course , well known for their uh trend uh trends . and well , uh what did you find ? uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . and um , material ? that should feel have uh a spongy feeling . and to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . then the old and rich . they like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . industrial designer : marketing : and um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . now , another picture . user interface : marketing : to get a feeling for this . well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . we uh aim at the younger market . so , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . however , with trends it 's always if there 's it 's now . it it it might last one year , and next year it be uh can be totally different . and i think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . so , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . so , that 's uh one thing to keep in mind . industrial designer : changing covers . user interface : marketing : project manager : marketing : yeah . any questions ? industrial designer : nope . project manager : no . it 's clear . so now , it 's uh ah , let 's see . now , w we have to decide well , we have to decide on the concept . so , we have to look at 's next . components and user interface concept . so now , we have to make some concept . maybe one of you can paint it on the board . first , uh user interface . industrial designer : uh , uh-uh . how w how we how we make it ? uh project manager : yes , a concept on uh industrial designer : marketing : project manager : just industrial designer : should n't we first discuss about like what w we all marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , but maybe we can paint it . uh , what do we want ? industrial designer : yeah , but if i paint with project manager : i 'll paint . okay . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : well something like this ? or shapes or what do we need ? user interface : mm , yes . what ? marketing : can make several uh concepts . project manager : yes , okay . marketing : we have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand . project manager : okay . industrial designer : more like something marketing : yeah i i i uh yes . user interface : industrial designer : m like yeah i ca n't dr i ca n't draw it . project manager : and you have to . industrial designer : uh marketing : user interface : industrial designer : i have to . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i 'm not a designer . it 's more three d_ . like , um when you have a part here . this is the remote control . and then you have something like th this under it . so , it 's easier to get it like this . project manager : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : it 's like a gun . marketing : yeah . user interface : marketing : a g project manager : so , it has to be soft ? marketing : mm . . industrial designer : and it has to be soft , yeah . project manager : okay . and uh , the buttons ? industrial designer : so , you can squeeze in it and sorry ? project manager : buttons . industrial designer : buttons on top of it . and here . the scrolling . you can do it with your thumb . project manager : no , it wo n't . industrial designer : user interface : but but i that 's the only scroll uh button on it then ? industrial designer : but now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . one till uh uh zero till nine . user interface : yeah , okay . project manager : but , well there one for the sound and one for the channels . user interface : but but how industrial designer : and the b marketing : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : yeah . how industrial designer : yeah ? or two buttons . user interface : okay . project manager : uh , two scroll uh wheels . marketing : and i if we go to uh industrial designer : if uh 'kay c if we do if we use one , then we 'll have just a switch on it , and you 'll just switch it , and now it 's the sound to switch back marketing : project manager : that 's th that 's more difficult . marketing : but if we have uh a me yeah . project manager : it 's better in marketing : if we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ? industrial designer : with the menu uh button . and then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : because uh , from h hundred uh remote controls , ninety nine have it . project manager : but if we do n't have a lcd we do n't have a menu . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : uh , then we have it on the tv , the menu . marketing : uh-uh . project manager : yeah , but again maybe th how do we know the tv can handle it ? industrial designer : user interface : project manager : you do n't know . so , there 's no menu . industrial designer : i do n't know . it 's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we do n't have teletext . project manager : no . so you ca n't use it . industrial designer : and if we put an lcd thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . project manager : okay , we make two concepts . one with lcd . one without lcd . industrial designer : 'kay . but you all like this kind of thing . uh project manager : good concept . but industrial designer : with the scroll button . project manager : that 's one . industrial designer : and and this one has to be soft . marketing : uh-uh . industrial designer : and this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . or some kind of rubber around it . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : it 's one . two . number two . user interface : and you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . project manager : user interface : like uh industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : industrial designer : ah that 's nice . user interface : industrial designer : here . trigger . marketing : project manager : no . but when you handle it , you put it on and off . user interface : just to uh project manager : it 's not good to use . industrial designer : project manager : yeah , but i 'll zap . user interface : oh , like a marketing : project manager : fuck . out . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : no , it 's not good . marketing : yeah . project manager : now , second concept . one with lcd , one without lcd . then uh paint it . user interface : industrial designer : paint it ? marketing : user interface : industrial designer : with the scroll thing on , like this ? project manager : one with two scroll buttons and one with without . yeah . uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . and the one with with a menu has an lcd . industrial designer : draw it . project manager : unbelievable . marketing : project manager : do i have to do everything . blank . you have not so difficult . marketing : yeah . user interface : but if you put push the the menu button project manager : uh , that 's the menu . there for the lcd screen . user interface : yeah , wh what yes , but you do n't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . project manager : you have to for the menu . user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . one that way . and one that way . so then it depends on the cost . s on and off . marketing : industrial designer : but is it easy to use ? when you have it on your left side , and project manager : when it 's not too big . just like a a phone . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : m uh yeah , maybe it 's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um industrial designer : separate , more separate , h yeah . marketing : more separate , yeah . project manager : yes , okay . marketing : like , you have the menu button in between uh industrial designer : yeah . on the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button . but would it be easy to use then ? if it 's like you have a big uh project manager : industrial designer : project manager : very good . is it better ? when you uh the menu , you have to go there there there there . industrial designer : i also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : they were like round curves , uh different uh project manager : yeah , okay . that 's that 's the outside . but now the industrial designer : okay , okay , okay . project manager : first the buttons . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : think we have we have now two buttons missing . the uh um the mute button . project manager : sorry ? marketing : we have two buttons missing . the mute button . and um , the to to uh have to uh numbers project manager : mute . and the other . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : okay . project manager : yeah . not so difficult . marketing : but , uh industrial designer : personally , i think two scroll buttons uh are n't easy to handle . project manager : but how do you wan na solve it ? industrial designer : with the switch button . project manager : yeah but on the menu that 's not uh easy . then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down . industrial designer : like uh oh , you mean like that . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh , then you can also have like uh th um project manager : a joystick . industrial designer : yeah , and joystick , i think . project manager : yeah . but is it uh does that break , a joystick ? or a small one just like in a laptop . industrial designer : yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . a little bit bigger , with easier thi project manager : mean , it 's better . but how expensive it is ? industrial designer : i do n't know . project manager : oh . why do i pay you for ? marketing : industrial designer : project manager : um , well um better ideas . marketing : okay . industrial designer : or no scroll uh things . just a shape . and no , no . it wo n't work . project manager : for the young peoples i think scroll button 's good . industrial designer : yeah . uh-huh . project manager : so think we have to keep them . industrial designer : or a remote control more like joystick . project manager : yeah , but is it that 's not expensive than uh joystick is better . a small one . industrial designer : a small one like this , like a nintendo uh k project manager : no just like in a industrial designer : playstation thing . project manager : a laptop . small , round . marketing : project manager : then it 's not so big . industrial designer : no , no , no . i mean the the shape of the remote control . project manager : oh the sh yeah , but then you can industrial designer : just like a playstation thing . yeah . project manager : so maybe , if it 's possible , it 's not too expensive , i think a joystick is better . marketing : project manager : a small one . so , please look at it . industrial designer : no , that 's okay , i got marketing : and on the lcd , how much it costs ? uh , it costs extra ? industrial designer : uh they 're not uh in details . project manager : industrial designer : it 's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? project manager : yeah we i think you get it . so , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it . user interface : industrial designer : then i have to come with it . marketing : industrial designer : i got my personal costs . i i do n't i do n't know the costs . project manager : your problem . not mine . industrial designer : marketing : industrial designer : then i 'll uh make something up . project manager : okay . so , do we have other concepts ? then for the components , we use a normal battery . then it 's ch cheapest way , i think . user interface : mm , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . project manager : no , no kinetic . kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . industrial designer : yeah , i think it 's uh , yeah , more expensive . yeah . project manager : so we use a normal battery . user interface : marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . project manager : chip . depends on the lcd . industrial designer : depends on the scroll . project manager : scroll . industrial designer : if we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . if we do n't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and that 's project manager : and uh , we if you use the lcd , we have to industrial designer : uh the most expensive . project manager : yes , okay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so , depends on the lcd and the scroll . industrial designer : if we yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : if we no okay scroll-wheel . so , i have this . so , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip . project manager : okay . so , uh the shapes of the design depends on the lcd and but , it has to be small . i think . industrial designer : or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? and then just put also on lcd on it ? project manager : if you have pistol , it lcd 's not easy . y y yeah but industrial designer : just use your thumb . project manager : if you use a phone . industrial designer : if you yeah . i use my thumb . project manager : k yeah , but but then you have it . like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . and the screen is industrial designer : yeah . project manager : well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen . industrial designer : if you have a joystick on no , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh playstation uh game controller . marketing : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and you move up , f forward , down , left . then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . it 's not just uh straight . project manager : no . no , no . marketing : industrial designer : that 's how we use it . that 's why they make joysticks like that , i think . marketing : uh project manager : yeah , but then you look forward . marketing : uh , yeah , but project manager : and then you can y marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah ? project manager : n well , if you have to look at it . marketing : if you industrial designer : 'kay . here 's our designer . marketing : if we have uh then something standing here , with the lcd . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : then it goes like this . industrial designer : yeah , why not . project manager : if th n well industrial designer : it 's for the younger people . project manager : yes , of course . industrial designer : it 's something new . project manager : that 's good good . user interface : it 's uh project manager : but the um , it may not break . industrial designer : now we put uh rubber around it . project manager : okay . if that 's possible . marketing : um , yeah . industrial designer : hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . and the uh the hand shape is also rubber . project manager : okay . user interface : or you can uh turn it inside . marketing : i ca n't see the . but , uh the easy of user interface : but that 's marketing : uh , th the ease of use was n't uh the most important uh aspect of it . user interface : no , that 's true . marketing : uh , for us it 's about to sell it . uh project manager : yeah of course . industrial designer : this is something new . marketing : project manager : okay . then this is the design . and the buttons are on the next page . so , depends on the cost . so , industrial designer : costs are okay . project manager : um we have one minute . user interface : . marketing : one . project manager : i think . no . marketing : no . you have more . project manager : more . seven . marketing : you have still ten . project manager : next meeting . thirty minutes . so hurry up . industrial designer : oh , that 's us together . project manager : you two stay here . marketing : project manager : paint it . user interface : okay . project manager : now you have to . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : so marketing : project manager : i think it 's clear . check your mail . so marketing : yeah . project manager : it has to be ready in the next meeting . so user interface : cookie . marketing : what ? okay . project manager : next meeting is called the detailed design . so everyth everything has to be ready . thanks for your attention . marketing : okay . industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : see you at the next meeting ."
