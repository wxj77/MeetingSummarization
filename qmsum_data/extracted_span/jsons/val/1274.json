    "query": "<s> why did the project manager agree with marketing when discussing his personal ideas towards the design ?",
    "answer": "marketing : or not . uh . oh there we go . perfect . okay . so this is me . um basically i was looking through some marketing reports that we 've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use tv remotes and see what it is that they 're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they do n't about their general tv remote control practices . um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody 's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that 's all that 's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they 're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public 's use , they 're not using a lot of it , they do n't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they do n't know what to do with . and um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . and then they ca n't find it in the room . so i think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . um there 's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , industrial designer : marketing : and pretty much they all think they 're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . i do n't know if that 's something we 're ready to look into technically , that 's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic 's obviously the one that 's gon na keep growing , so if that 's the direction we 're headed in it 's something to think about . um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . so it 's a good start for us . project manager : that 's great . thank you sarah . right . so um marketing : need to unplug this ? project manager : yep i 'll just uh switch that back here . marketing : need it back . project manager : i 'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . marketing : there you go . project manager : right so i think we 've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys 's presentations um we 've got uh y the industrial designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . um sarah , she 's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , marketing : oh right . project manager : um so do we wan na go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is um we 've got w if we 're gon na go for a sleek look i mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um . marketing : we 're not catering to the pensioners of the world i do n't think so . user interface : project manager : yes . so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . um . so"
