    "answer": "grad e : yeah . grad f : or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active . professor c : this uh yeah , well there there seems to be context properties . yeah . grad f : yeah , they 're contex and for instance , i used to have a location thing there but actually that 's a property of the situation . and it 's again , time , you know at cert certain points things are located , you know , near or far from you professor c : well , uh , uh , this is recursive grad f : and professor c : cuz until we do the uh , mental space story , we 're not quite sure { comment } th - th grad f : yeah . professor c : which is fine . we 'll just we 'll j grad f : yeah , yeah . so some of these are , uh professor c : we just do n't know yet . grad f : right . so i so for now i thought , well maybe i 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance , right ? everything else here is utterance - specific . um , and i left the slot , `` predications `` , open because you can have , um , things like `` the guy i know from school `` . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make . and it 's unclear whether i mean , you could just have in your scenario , `` here are some extra few things that are true `` , right ? grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : and then you could just sort of not have this slot here . right ? you 're but but it 's used for identification purposes . professor c : right . grad e : yeah . grad f : so it 's it 's a little bit different from just saying `` all these things are true from my utterance `` . grad e : yeah . right , `` this guy i know from school came for dinner `` does not mean , um , `` there 's a guy , i know him from school , and he came over for dinner `` . that 's not the same effect . grad f : yeah , it 's a little bit it 's a little bit different . right ? so or maybe that 's like a restrictive , non - restrictive grad e : yeah . grad f : you know , it 's like it gets into that kind of thing for um , but maybe i 'm mixing , you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : so you might imagine that the information you pass to , you know in identifying a particular referent would be , `` oh , some `` you know , `` it 's a guy and it 's someone i know from school `` . grad e : yeah . grad f : so maybe that would , you know , be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the , whatever , construal engine or whatever , discourse context , to find you know , either create this reference , grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : in which case it 'd be created here , and you know , so so you could imagine that this might not so , uh , i 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things . grad a : but to make it m precise at least in my mind , uh , it 's not precise . so `` house `` is gender neuter ? in reality grad f : um , it could be in grad a : or in professor c : semantically . grad a : semantically . grad f : semantically , yeah . yeah . grad a : so grad f : so it uh , uh , a table . you know , a thing that c does n't have a gender . so . uh , it could be that i mean , maybe you 'd maybe not all these i mean , i wou i would say that i tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most most things . grad a : no , just to make sure that we everybody that 's completely agreed that it it has nothing to do with , uh , form . grad f : yeah . ok , that is semantic as opposed to yeah . yeah . that 's right . um . grad a : then `` predications `` makes sense to to have it open for something like , uh , accessibility or not . grad f : s so again open to various things . grad a : yeah . grad f : right . ok , so . let 's see . so maybe having made that big sca sort of like large scale comment , should i just go through each of these slots uh , each of these blocks , um , a little bit ? grad e : sure . grad f : um , mostly the top one is sort of image schematic . and just a note , which was that , um s so when we actually ha so for instance , um , some of them seem more inherently static , ok , like a container or sort of support - ish . and others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like `` source , path , goal `` is often thought of that way or `` force `` , or something like that . but in actual fact , i think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that . and different x - schemas use them in a way that 's either static or dynamic . so `` path `` , you could just be talking about the path between this and this . and you know , `` container `` that you can go in and out . all of these things . and so , um , i think this came up when , uh , ben and i were working with the spaniards , um , the other day the `` spaniettes `` , as we called them um , to decide like how you want to split up , like , s image schematic contributions versus , like , x - schematic contributions . how do you link them up . and i think again , um , it 's gon na be something in the x - schema that tells you `` is this static or is this dynamic `` . so we definitely need that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that . um , that , you know , is it , uh , a state or is it a change of state , or is it a , um , action of some kind ? grad a : uh , i i i is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you do n't ? grad f : uh . yeah . grad a : just means"
