    "answer": "marketing : great man . who starts ? project manager : well i 'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . marketing : alright , great . alright . project manager : okay . i 've put some uh new things in the in the map . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : uh oh . this is it . i do n't know the shortcut , so ah f_ five . well our functional design meeting , that 's the stage we 're in . and you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it . well um in we 'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . but uh uh then we 'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . i think you have prepared uh all three uh ? marketing : 'kay . industrial designer : well , yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : um we 'll look at th the new project requirements we uh i dunno . y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? industrial designer : no . project manager : oh i 've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , marketing : no . you 're the only one . project manager : and i 'll have a look if marketing : alright . project manager : well i think we should show them before your presentations , because it 's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we ca n't , because of the new requirements . well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . marketing : 'kay . project manager : we have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . and then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . uh industrial designer : we have forty minutes for this uh discussion ? project manager : uh yeah , i think so . industrial designer : alright . project manager : well uh the closing uh we 'll not uh look at it yet . user interface : marketing : alright . project manager : um now i 'll look at show this board . um well uh notes , first meeting . now . i gave a disc a a presentation . uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . so we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . marketing : right . project manager : we should make it uh compatible with our new d_v_d_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . uh not too many one buttons . one recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . and um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a d_v_d_ and a television . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . it 's uh one of our ideas . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : yeah well that wa it 's just thirty minutes ago , user interface : project manager : so it 's not quite uh but well i have to do it . industrial designer : mm-hmm , now it 's right . marketing : yeah . project manager : the materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . it should be uh recognisable at all times . user interface : industrial designer : it 's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . marketing : okay . project manager : well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones . and uh the technical aspects um and also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . well that 's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . it 's quite logical al all of it . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : um now the new project requirements , i 'll just show them . i got this mail from uh our bosses . well , teletext goes out . we will not use teletext . marketing : okay . project manager : maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . industrial designer : i i disagree , but uh it 's not uh t it 's not my place to disagree i guess . project manager : well the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the d_v_d_ and they do n't want it , because of our time we have for this project . marketing : alright . industrial designer : oh , alright . user interface : oh , that 's a shame . project manager : so that 's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . because uh we do n't have those customers a lot at th at this point . um well it 's a bit pity because it 's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it . marketing : yeah . but let 's forget about it . it 's just time-consuming , project manager : yeah . marketing : so we uh have to go on . user interface : project manager : well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . so uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . industrial designer : yeah , we are a real fashionable company . i read uh i read it on the project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i did n't know what company we were , but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . marketing : project manager : yeah . okay . industrial designer : so it has to be uh a modern design . that 's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course . project manager : yes . i i uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . it 's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so maybe that 's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . marketing : right . user interface : yeah . project manager : alright then um we 're going to uh have three presentations . marketing : yeah . project manager : you want to start ? industrial designer : marketing : yeah . i think i have to start . project manager : oh you have to start ? i did n't see anything about uh who had to start . industrial designer : the order ? no . marketing : oh no , no problem . project manager : well s then start . marketing : i i just have to uh to think which file 's mine , user interface : marketing : 'cause i was uh bit in a hurry . project manager : okay . well uh marketing : i think it 's this one . but i 'm not sure . project manager : you already uh opened uh powerpoint . marketing : hmm ? yeah . s right . user interface : marketing : yes . this is it . project manager : yeah . marketing : well , i 'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : um to start with these points . uh next sheet ? um at first i tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it 's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . uh , furthermore it 's very important what they do like and what they do use . um then i tell something about um the most important issues . so we have to focus on those three thing three things . and in the end i 'll um show you our target audience or our target product users , customers . well , um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . project manager : marketing : that 's seventy five per cent of the current users . they do n't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . um they also say , that 's about uh i thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . so it 's very important that you design a a nice looking control . um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . so it 's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . furthermore , it 's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . industrial designer : you can zap away . yeah . marketing : yeah , yeah right . project manager : yeah . marketing : right . a lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : so it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that 's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . project manager : well user interface : yeah . marketing : i dunno , maybe that 's an idea . 'cause it 's uh a big i think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . industrial designer : oh ? project manager : it should actually uh it should actually be loose from the television , user interface : yeah . project manager : because it can also be used for other televisions . so if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . marketing : yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ? project manager : no you can click it on your television . marketing : yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? project manager : yeah in another room , yeah . industrial designer : project manager : well yes . marketing : nee but it it specifically says it 's uh the the control is lost in the same room . user interface : project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : so well a beeping device would be project manager : well we 'll have a look at it , yeah . marketing : uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it 's it 's too uh too difficult to learn . so the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . user interface : industrial designer : i think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . uh marketing : yeah but people do n't read manuals . industrial designer : i did n't read it ? oh , alright . users to uh add one ? do you think ? user interface : i do n't think marketing : i think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . user interface : yeah . yes you should you should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it 's supposed to work . industrial designer : mm-hmm . yeah alright . because they do n't use it ? alright . project manager : well there sh should always be a menu , marketing : yeah . right . project manager : but it c can be very short . marketing : and it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . user interface : yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , i think . project manager : yes okay . industrial designer : well maybe for the if you do n't recognise a button who d who d who do i call uh wh when i do n't know it ? marketing : alright . user interface : yeah right . it sh it should be there , the manual . but but not to explain how the remote works . only marketing : and we do n't have much time . so it 's better to uh put our attention to the the design . so you can pick up and use it , than i think . project manager : well we are a design team , we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . industrial designer : is n't it part of the of the u marketing : yeah right , right . user interface : industrial designer : no . no . never mind . project manager : well we 'll have a look . um yes ? marketing : next point . um r_s_i_ . user interface : marketing : well that 's about twenty per cent i thought . but uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh wie zeg ik dat ? yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . industrial designer : consider the m yeah . marketing : it should be a good in your hand . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : right , this is the most important part . um , we 're like the requirements said , we 're gon na specify of we 're gon na target a younger audience . um , that 's about sixty per cent of the market , so it 's uh quite important . um research shows that they like to have a little lcd screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . uh i thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . project manager : well marketing : so it 's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . project manager : well with twelve euro fifty as production cost , we ca n't uh afford an lcd uh industrial designer : it 's going to be expensive . yeah . marketing : yeah but they think it 's really important . project manager : yeah . marketing : so if we want to s if we have a big if we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , i dunno . we have to uh project manager : well industrial designer : well we 'll uh consider it uh . project manager : yeah well uh it 's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh industrial designer : we 'll think abo we 'll think marketing : yeah , i do n't know . i do n't have any information on that . so project manager : nigh user interface : project manager : i know . industrial designer : no , we 'll look we 'll look into that later . alright ? marketing : right . and uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . they also like that , user interface : marketing : but research is very uh costly . so user interface : i think that 's uh difficult to realise also . marketing : yeah , but it it might be important for the sale . industrial designer : we have very demanding clients . project manager : it 's not yet a standard uh development uh those so user interface : no and we have customers in multiple uh countries i think . marketing : well i do think lcd is more reachable than the speech recognition . project manager : yeah absolutely . user interface : yeah . marketing : so we might consider lcd screens . user interface : no . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , alright . well we 'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , i think . we do n't rule them out uh yet . marketing : alright . project manager : 'kay . marketing : alright . um , i think that 's it . um project manager : alright . marketing : i think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . so you can right . project manager : well you i c i can uh still see your presentation . marketing : yeah . right . project manager : it 's in the well uh next um i dunno who is next . user interface : oh you go . industrial designer : shall i give a technical talk ? alright . project manager : well go ahead . industrial designer : well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . we have that here . okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the project manager : f_ five . industrial designer : f_ f_ five . project manager : f_ five . user interface : industrial designer : well , the working design , marketing : alright . project manager : industrial designer : that 's my uh marketing : next button . industrial designer : well alright uh , you know who i am and what i do . so uh we have this . it 's a bit uh unclear because i wanted to copy paste something . it was originally in black and white marketing : oh right . industrial designer : but it became black and purple . marketing : purple . industrial designer : but i think you can read it . user interface : project manager : marketing : yeah , yeah , yeah . a bit . industrial designer : um well um i think it 's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . uh well you can see uh marketing : maybe you can select it . so it uh inverts . industrial designer : and i then can select i can select on the dings it goes to the next page . marketing : the p the whole picture . project manager : click . marketing : nah , uh never mind . industrial designer : well , you can read it , user interface : yeah , go ahead . industrial designer : it 's not too difficult . meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . you have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the led , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . marketing : yeah . alright . industrial designer : and uh the source is of course the user . uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course . user interface : industrial designer : and the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the led , and the led sends it to the receiver . that 's the that 's the basic idea . very basic . marketing : industrial designer : um well i have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps . project manager : industrial designer : uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . it does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . the key a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . uh and recognise the key . so well you understand . project manager : industrial designer : the chip uh produces morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . and it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the led , which is the bulb , of course . project manager : industrial designer : now the led produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it 's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the tv set , project manager : yeah . marketing : industrial designer : and the tv set uh also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task . project manager : so it is also why we have to have a button that says uh i 'm now busy with a d_v_d_ uh if we had done that . and a button for tv . so industrial designer : ah bu yeah , but we do n't . uh we user interface : industrial designer : no no , but yeah . exactly . uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . project manager : industrial designer : i 've some couple of pictures here . it 's a very basic one . and uh if we if we 're going to add an uh an uh lcd screen to it , it uh wo n't look anything like this , but this is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . it has uh very little buttons and user interface : industrial designer : but it it uh it 's it 's quite um yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . they 're uh far enough apart and an anything . it 's not very um uh not very high-tech uh user interface : high tech . industrial designer : indeed , and it 's not very user-friendly . uh if you look at the shape , it 's uh just a simple long box uh shape . so we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh r_s_i_ and uh those kinds of thing do n't do n't oc do n't occur . marketing : right . can i say something ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um i have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . well teletext is not an option , so that uh industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : but i think it 's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you ca n't have r_s_i_ uh consequences . industrial designer : yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately marketing : right . make them big , make them easy to uh to press . project manager : well but but user interface : you can also like industrial designer : you do n't have to look and and search for them . project manager : if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . marketing : right . user interface : yeah , i was thinking you can marketing : yeah , right . right . project manager : but if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , user interface : project manager : and that 's on of the things about r_s_i_ . user interface : are some of the the the um marketing : yeah , that 's right . that 's right . that 's right . industrial designer : well you you ca n't have any uh every button under the thumb , of course . project manager : no but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject r_ r_s_i_ r_s_i_ . marketing : but yeah . that 's very important . and user interface : maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . like some uh little uh gameboy things or some project manager : yes i 've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . marketing : but is that is that useable ? do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? project manager : user interface : well marketing : it 's a f it 's a new feature , project manager : well it it 's industrial designer : yeah . marketing : you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . user interface : yeah alright , but project manager : well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote user interface : yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they 'll understand it , i think . project manager : yeah . if someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he 's a already on the next channel . user interface : eighty per cent would . industrial designer : well , . marketing : yeah , he feels it immediately . project manager : that 's very irritating , i think . user interface : yeah that 's true . marketing : yeah , that 's right . yeah . user interface : yeah but marketing : right , continue . industrial designer : but in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . marketing : sorry . industrial designer : i think that 's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they do n't use it uh all the time . well it 's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said . and i have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh i do n't want to get too technical , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : because uh that 's not uh very uh useful for you . project manager : that 's your part of the job . marketing : yeah , that 's right . industrial designer : so yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . and uh well that 's about it i think . oh yeah , i still have this . oh i had to delete this , but i had to make a schematic uh of the of the new marketing : alright . project manager : okay . industrial designer : but i had too too little time , marketing : industrial designer : but uh do n't uh do n't look at it please . user interface : project manager : well we understand . industrial designer : i i think it 's it 's clear uh how it works . marketing : alright . project manager : we understand . marketing : yeah , it 's clear . project manager : oh right , no . industrial designer : alright . that 's the most important thing . project manager : nice . then uh mike can uh give the third presentation . industrial designer : alright . uh project manager : how late is did we start his presentation uh ? industrial designer : right . marketing : i dunno . i think uh w about twenty minutes ago ? project manager : wha yeah . marketing : losing time losing time . project manager : well then we have still the time , so but we do have to come to a decision , right later on . marketing : yeah right . so project manager : so user interface : well i thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing , but obviously that 's not the case . marketing : i do n't think so . industrial designer : yeah , uh there are different uh we have all have different home pages , with different links . project manager : oh yeah ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah right . user interface : for instance you could n't see this . project manager : okay , yeah well . user interface : um yeah . well i 'm mike , user interface designer . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : the the method ? well i used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . project manager : yeah . user interface : um marketing : these are already in use ? user interface : yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . marketing : alright , okay . user interface : um this one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : um marketing : well project manager : i like user-centred . marketing : yeah , me too . user interface : i like user-centr centred uh uh also the best . project manager : yeah . we also do that . user interface : um well , i thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the d_v_d_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . uh so i thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . marketing : but we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? user interface : but yes . project manager : yeah . user interface : th that 's why this mm is not relevant any more i feel . project manager : marketing : alright . user interface : um i think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we 'll need . marketing : yeah , right . user interface : i um i kinda like the shape . i think this is what we talked about . but industrial designer : you ca n't really see uh the differ from different sides . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but i think uh user interface : no i 've well i showed it somewhere . um industrial designer : uh you can draw it if you yeah . user interface : oh yeah . i think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so we can can uh yeah customise the project manager : well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . so we can not just uh make someone w user interface : mm ? yeah . it 's a front . it 's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . project manager : no but that 's th the side they look uh look at is the front . user interface : you can marketing : but it project manager : so if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . marketing : yeah , that 's right user interface : or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . marketing : yeah , that 's a must . user interface : so l like ericsson does every uh project manager : yeah , we must . industrial designer : we can put it on the on the back side . marketing : we must have that . project manager : yeah well and and user interface : s something like this . it 's recognisable . project manager : 'kay . user interface : um marketing : we can make a symbol of the company right here . and if you put a front on it , there 's a hole on the front . so the symbol 's always on user interface : yeah ? industrial designer : yeah , so that you do n't replace the symbol , yeah . project manager : yeah yeah yeah . user interface : yeah yeah . something like that , project manager : or the th the the lowest part of the remote is n't changed by the front . user interface : in the yeah . marketing : yeah . yeah , yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : those kind of things . user interface : yeah . marketing : but let 's not focus on the front . project manager : yes . okay . user interface : um well so uh uh like i said i thought we 'd we 'd use more function . if we we had to include more functions . but we do n't . so um project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . i think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . marketing : alright . user interface : maybe some less . like eject we do n't need , and some other buttons we do n't need . i think uh industrial designer : mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the word documents file ? in map ? user interface : yeah , i will . i think uh for the remote um uh less is more . the less buttons the better the design . um project manager : yeah . user interface : we should go with that concept i think . marketing : yeah , i agree . user interface : i know . project manager : alright . marketing : i 've i 've got another point . project manager : yeah ? marketing : um there are two target audi audiences , and we 've uh chose for the younger one . um , research has shown that um it 's a high interested uh in features . they are high high interested in feature . but they are more critical . fo yeah , critical . industrial designer : the younger uh marketing : so the younger audience . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : so we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . project manager : well what if we um i at i at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : a f a little uh you can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people do n't use but s some do do . industrial designer : mm-hmm . i think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh marketing : clip are n't used much . project manager : well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , industrial designer : no um mm usually marketing : yeah right . industrial designer : but project manager : but not user interface : yeah , but what kind of features ? like lcd screens and voice recognition . industrial designer : yeah i think m most marketing : yeah but yeah . user interface : but i 've industrial designer : most uh marketing : here , look at these numbers . the newest features are , like i said , are uh lcd and uh speech uh control . our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . uh . marketing : you see ? so we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . project manager : competitors . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . our competitor . yeah . marketing : the concurrent ? competitors , right . project manager : marketing : so , i do think we have to uh have some features . project manager : yeah . well maybe w we could uh s marketing : even though they cost a little more . project manager : on um some uh calculators you have lo those little little lcd th that you can click on or something , marketing : right . right . project manager : or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . and if if that 's gives you a little bit of sta status information . marketing : like a ticker-tape . project manager : yeah . marketing : which programme you are l watching or something . user interface : yeah , that 's nice . project manager : those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your v_ v_c_r_s . and uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you 're currently watching . marketing : yeah , right . yeah right . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . so it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your lcd screen . project manager : for example . it it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . user interface : yeah , we should keep that simple too . project manager : yeah . user interface : it will industrial designer : but should it uh really be uh clickable , uh project manager : well maybe . marketing : no not clickable . user interface : no , it should be uh integrated . industrial designer : or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . marketing : nah , no no no . user interface : i think marketing : yeah , just at at the top . so when you s you sit like this you can can watch . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah , marketing : i think it should be at the top . user interface : something like on um some radios in car . you where it 's , yeah , walking to yeah . marketing : yeah right . it 's a ticker-tape idea . project manager : r_d_s_s or something . industrial designer : but that 's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing . user interface : wa yeah . project manager : well i think it 's you got it just means it 's a script that 's uh keeps it uh rolling , marketing : well it 's just one script . project manager : and it 's not uh that 's five minutes off uh implementing time i think uh marketing : yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . project manager : yeah . user interface : marketing : so i do n't think that 's the issue . industrial designer : alright . marketing : alright , we go with the lcd screen ? project manager : uh well i think so , yes . um user interface : yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . marketing : 'kay . right , i do n't know if i can find that , but project manager : we 're g no but we 're we 'll have to look into that . user interface : or maybe you will get that information uh project manager : um we can use this board again , i think . marketing : next time . yeah right . user interface : yeah . project manager : uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . where is my presentation ? uh marketing : yeah , i understand what you 're saying . project manager : uh marketing : we should have a general idea of how it 's gon na look . project manager : well i mean we 're all here now , i think . these i 've already given you . so we have to decide on the different remote control functions . so we want to have a small lcd screen that 's special . marketing : right . at the top . industrial designer : should n't we start with the most important parts ? user interface : at the top or at the bottom ? industrial designer : the lcd screen alright but we should start with the power button ? marketing : i think the top is more uh project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh user interface : yeah but marketing : when you s how do you zap ? project manager : marketing : you just sit in your chair ? project manager : user interface : yeah but with with the lcd screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . marketing : with the remote ? project manager : that thing is terrible . user interface : 'cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . marketing : yeah but that 's where your hand ball might be . project manager : uh user interface : yeah , no mm . marketing : yeah , i dunno . industrial designer : and then uh marketing : we 'll draw two , and then we 'll see uh industrial designer : maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . i dunno what uh you were talking about but marketing : no industrial designer : we are busy with something . marketing : um he thinks yeah , right . he thinks it 's better to put the lcd at the bottom , and i think it 's better at the top . project manager : well industrial designer : uh-huh . why do you think it 's better at the bottom ? user interface : uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . marketing : but your industrial designer : but you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there 's room for the for the interface . marketing : yeah . user interface : well i d i think that 's that 's ugly but marketing : the the ticker the lcd is like like small . it 's it 's wide . industrial designer : uh-huh . marketing : it 's not not high . but project manager : well i th i think mike mike has a point , user interface : i th industrial designer : and and we can project manager : because um when when uh when i use a remote i l i hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . user interface : yeah . power button always yeah . yeah . industrial designer : bottom . project manager : so and and i i like to use the ones on the top . user interface : yeah , y you got ta zap like this or you want to yeah . project manager : so when i u when i have to have an lcd s scr window marketing : yeah right . but we 're making a remote with with a few functions you know . industrial designer : well that 's a bit exaggerated . well , i agree with you . it 's it 's also more recognisable . it looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . marketing : project manager : yes but we we we we do n't want that . user interface : yeah you do n't want project manager : we do n't want them to look like a calculator . user interface : you want uh yeah it it it must be a remote . project manager : we want to look it like our original but familiar industrial designer : yeah w well , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but uh you do n't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , marketing : high-tech . project manager : yea industrial designer : uh because i think it 's uh marketing : project manager : maybe a bic uh better uh white uh we white ? industrial designer : i think it 's still important to have it at the top , marketing : width . project manager : width . uh format yeah format ? line width ? width ? industrial designer : because it 's uh it 's more familiar that way . marketing : th that 's not a problem . project manager : yeah ? marketing : when i draw here it user interface : marketing : oh . huh ? project manager : it 's a bit off . marketing : yeah , it 's off . project manager : well . industrial designer : a little a little bit . marketing : it it needs to be calibrated again . well project manager : well uh let 's uh talk about that later uh industrial designer : maybe you should another pen . user interface : industrial designer : maybe that 's uh better . you e you only have one pen for that screen . yeah . marketing : where ? project manager : it 's special pen . marketing : alright , we have to make a decision now , project manager : yeah . marketing : because we do n't have much time . um i think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the lcd above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . industrial designer : yeah . i i agree . project manager : i think it should be at the button , bottom . bottom . the lcd . user interface : at the bottom ? industrial designer : well i 'm the i i 'm the designer , so um user interface : in a few minutes marketing : at the bot user interface : oh yeah , oh yeah , i totally agree . yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : so we are two uh v_s_ two . project manager : well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , user interface : he 's the boss . project manager : and then look at the design . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : right . great . industrial designer : uh we uh we were busy with that . project manager : because we have to decide this . industrial designer : uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so , we have the power button . marketing : and moreover i think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the lcd s . it 's uh your it 's your job . project manager : well we have a power button . industrial designer : yeah of course . uh it 's uh . yeah . w wh user interface : no it 's our job . project manager : guys ? user interface : for all of us i think . industrial designer : while you have to agree , i can say it 's like this and you must agree . yeah . marketing : yeah , right . project manager : guys ? marketing : alright , let 's keep it central . project manager : we have a power button , setting buttons , lcd window , the number buttons user interface : the ten numbers ? yeah ? industrial designer : channel , yeah . project manager : uh user interface : volume ? industrial designer : volume control . um project manager : uh the mute button . industrial designer : well let 's look at your uh design . uh project manager : i h love that one . marketing : industrial designer : uh-huh . user interface : i think we we should use something like this um to um the the channel up and channel down button ? yeah , in circle , you know ? project manager : yes . yeah . yeah yeah yeah . well that 's that 's also design . user interface : and and a volume control also in it . project manager : yes . um marketing : right . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : well h ho industrial designer : but th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a d_v_d_ player or something . so project manager : yes . yes . they are for some uh video uh user interface : yes , as i already said , we could drop some of these buttons . marketing : you should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . user interface : yeah . i think these should be in one big circle in the middle . marketing : yeah , but what he said about r_s_i_ was t kinda true . when when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you 're doing the same thing all the time , project manager : marketing : and that 's just what r_s_i_ 's all about . so it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . project manager : apart . so people have to move their hand . and they get less uh complaints of r_s_i_ . industrial designer : yeah , it 's it 's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . project manager : that 's what i always do , industrial designer : y project manager : because all my i important buttons are the same place . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . it 's good to move uh from time to time . yeah . user interface : yeah but people do n't like it when their buttons are all over the place . marketing : um project manager : well not user interface : they they need to be centred . industrial designer : no but now y w would we have to choose a way in middle ? marketing : frequency of uh button use . industrial designer : marketing : um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . you can see . project manager : uh-huh . user interface : volume hardly . marketing : so the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , i think , up and down . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : no i do n't think . industrial designer : oh . project manager : up and down far apart from each other ? industrial designer : far apart ? marketing : you thinking uh about r_s_i_ ? user interface : yeah but project manager : well not too much . user interface : yeah but marketing : y look at uh look at the frequency . user interface : no . industrial designer : marketing : nei not too much , but user interface : the other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . so industrial designer : i think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you do n't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . project manager : well for example the power button , you can user interface : well they are used four times an hour , so project manager : if someone is constantly z zapping , it 's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . because i have someone but the buttons is way . marketing : nei nei nei n i i totally agree . project manager : so that one can be put away . marketing : but just yeah . right . yeah . i agree . project manager : the power button can uh be uh uh user interface : power bu button should be left at the top . project manager : yes . marketing : and should and should be red . project manager : oh man , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : five minutes . yeah , well five minutes left . marketing : right , just make some decisions . the most important things we have to uh project manager : um how are we going to do it with those numbers ? industrial designer : c c can you make you make we can use uh the drawing board now , i think . uh it it does n't work well but but it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing . project manager : well i have it here . yeah well that 's going to take too too much time . marketing : i do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . user interface : mm . yeah . marketing : just uh you decide that , you decide that , industrial designer : mm . alright . marketing : and ready . project manager : well the lcd . um you are industrial , you are user interface . so i think it 's going to go to mike . but you will have to make consensus with . user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : well user interface : well consensus , um we we can put it in the middle , so project manager : well it 's a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually . marketing : nei . we 're no project manager : that 's a bit uh marketing : we 're deciding now , so top or bottom ? industrial designer : well uh yeah i i still think it 's it 's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so project manager : yes it is . industrial designer : yeah . you say familiarity is n't important but project manager : well what if we 're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah d yeah . marketing : yeah , right . okay . project manager : alright these functions . user interface : alright . industrial designer : as we we we we agreed , we do have a lcd . project manager : the number f well yes , that 's alright . industrial designer : so that 's that 's enough . yeah . marketing : yeah , okay . project manager : w the number function . are we going to uh do it like uh on mike 's screen with uh one button that says i 'm going to do a t two number digital ? how do you want it to do then ? user interface : well just when you push a one one and industrial designer : there 's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . project manager : it it has to r recognise one as there could still come more . user interface : no , if you on most tvs if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , d it industrial designer : oh , like that . um they 'd recognise it . project manager : alright so no button for that . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : th that 's the most user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : that that 's very easy . yeah . project manager : okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ? industrial designer : i think these are the the most important functions . marketing : do you still have the pictures over there ? user interface : yeah . project manager : so marketing : yeah , that 's about it . you do need the uh multi or did uh no , like this one . you do need them ? project manager : no , we 'd uh just said we did n't uh marketing : yeah , i know . user interface : marketing : but are we project manager : well uh marketing : alright , alright uh now okay . project manager : um well because we ca n't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . so just for a television is that all we need ? marketing : right . yeah , it 's most useable this way . industrial designer : basic function . user interface : yeah . project manager : teletext is gone . so all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext oh screen placing . marketing : project manager : we 'll have uh those uh buttons about uh and uh the two important ones we 're l f forgetting . marketing : project manager : uh there 's um screen . you can make it wider and less wide . marketing : yeah . project manager : and the button that you can go to a_v_ for your video . marketing : right . industrial designer : oh yeah . marketing : i do think we have to put that underneath a clip . project manager : those two ? but it 's just two , and we make a clip ? industrial designer : uh just two just two under uh under uh marketing : project manager : th that 's a bit uh waste . user interface : we we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . marketing : yeah . okay , right . project manager : or at the top . industrial designer : i i think uh project manager : your lcd screen is going to go . user interface : or at industrial designer : but you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . user interface : yeah alright then . industrial designer : uh that 's that 's too complicated . you can just put it somewhere they they are n't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere user interface : oh , they can be small or round like buttons . industrial designer : yeah s bit smaller and s well uh and and i think more at the bottom . yeah . yeah or at the top , yeah . what do you think uh those those buttons ? project manager : well i think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . industrial designer : above or down ? and w where ? well we design it later . we have it , and we design later where everything goes . yeah . project manager : yes ? yes . yes . well any other uh marketing : well if you you take those th if you user interface : why go to video ? project manager : go to video , that 's always on your remote control . to a_v_ uh to a_v_ a_v_ a_v_ . marketing : yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh industrial designer : the the video channel uh ? user interface : that 's just zero . yeah . project manager : well l n no not at not at my remote . industrial designer : no no not always . ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel . user interface : project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , but you can can zap down marketing : yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to a_v_ . project manager : yes . i do n't . user interface : yes , i think th project manager : i go to ninety-nine . user interface : no , then you press ninety nine . marketing : ah uh well whatever , . user interface : i think go to video is an irrelevant button , but project manager : th that 's the button uh no . industrial designer : but it 's easy to go if you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . project manager : no you can ch push zero . yeah . yeah , industrial designer : it 's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button . project manager : i i think that one button is uh i use it uh user interface : marketing : yeah , but if we 're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new tv . you have to set the channels . project manager : yeah ? marketing : right all th these uh different buttons you have to project manager : these buttons , i do n't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote . industrial designer : yeah well uh d different screen settings a yeah , sk marketing : ah , i do . project manager : it 's it 's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those user interface : yeah well y you must have . industrial designer : yeah y you you you you have screen width . user interface : yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , project manager : user interface : and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh marketing : right . that 's the only one we put uh in there . project manager : so we still have one uh four ? marketing : for a screen uh fu uh channel setting . industrial designer : yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the yeah . marketing : programme , right . project manager : okay . oh the okay button ? marketing : uh project manager : oh you always have in the centre an okay button , for your menu . user interface : yeah , alright . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : menu button . industrial designer : you should yeah . i think that 's important . project manager : channel , setting , menu . industrial designer : uh and and the settings to change the brightness project manager : we have to go . industrial designer : the settings to change the brightness and the contrast . marketing : project manager : okay . industrial designer : channel , yeah . project manager : so um save . industrial designer : chief ? chief ? project manager : yes see . industrial designer : th the menu menu button is also important . project manager : yes i have put it in . industrial designer : then you can uh where ? i do n't see it . project manager : here . industrial designer : oh menu , alright . project manager : user interface : i think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah . industrial designer : in the menu . and you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . user interface : yeah , the project manager : alright . industrial designer : because uh the zapping buttons are n't used then if you are in the menu . user interface : or the volume or something like that . project manager : guys ? industrial designer : yeah . or the volume , yeah . project manager : we 're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we 'll have to decide s things on our own i think . so user interface : your pen . marketing : ah . great . industrial designer : yes chief . project manager : marketing : alright . project manager : well see you uh user interface : i thought we 'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ? project manager : w w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh industrial designer : yeah this is this is your thing . user interface : yeah , lunch break . marketing : ah . okay . industrial designer : i am hungry . project manager : lunch . marketing : get into my belly . project manager : ah . we did n't exactly do everything but so user interface :"
