    "answer": "grad e : i guess . grad a : ok , we 're on . so just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless . grad e : check one . check one . grad a : and you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change . grad b : so , which is my bar ? mah ! number one . grad e : sibilance . sibilance . grad a : so , actually , if you guys wan na go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright . grad e : are we supposed to read digits at the same time ? grad a : no . no . grad e : oh , ok . grad a : each individually . we 're talking about doing all at the same time but i think cognitively that would be really difficult . to try to read them while everyone else is . grad e : everyone would need extreme focus . grad a : so , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on . professor c : other way . we m we may wind up with ver we we may need versions of all this garbage . grad b : for our stuff . yeah . professor c : yeah . grad a : um . so the first thing you 'd wan na do is just say which transcript you 're on . professor c : yeah . grad a : so . you can see the transcript ? there 's two large number strings on the digits ? so you would just read that one . and then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . and the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . and i 'll give i 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . um . again , i 'm not sure how much i should talk about stuff before everyone 's here . professor c : mmm . well , we have one more coming . grad a : ok . well , why do n't i go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there . professor c : ok . well , we can start doing it . grad a : thanks . so , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . all of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . and that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you do n't breathe into the mike . um . yeah , that 's good . and uh so , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . and the short form i mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . so , if you say things and you do n't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you do n't like . um . on the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . if you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . so , do n't worry too much about it . the it 's just self rating . um . and i think that 's about it . i mean , should i do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ? professor c : um , yeah . grad a : or ? professor c : no . there was there was let 's see . oh grad e : does nancy know that we 're meeting in here ? grad b : i sent an email . professor c : she got an emai she was notified . grad e : oh yeah , she got an e yeah , yeah . professor c : whether she knows is another question . um . so are the people going to be identified by name ? grad a : well , what we 're gon na we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . um , but not in the audio . professor c : right . grad a : so the professor c : ok . so , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . since it it does is n't attributed . oh , i see , but the a but the but the grad a : right , so if i said , `` oh , hi jerry , how are you ? `` , we 're not gon na go through and cancel out the `` jerry `` s . professor c : yeah . sure . grad a : um , so we will go through and , in the speaker id tags there 'll be , you know , m - one o seven , m - one o eight . professor c : right . grad a : um , but uh , professor c : right . grad a : um , it w uh , i do n't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data . professor c : ok . mm - hmm . no , i i was n't complaining , i just wanted to understand . grad a : right . grad b : well , we can make up aliases for each of us . grad a : yeah , i mean , whatever you wan na do is fine , professor c : right . grad a : but we find that we want the meeting to be as natural as possible . so , we 're trying to do real meetings . and so we do n't wan na have to do aliases professor c : right . grad a : and we do n't want people to be editing what they say . grad b : right . grad a : so i think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash microsoft . professor c : right . grad b : mm - hmm . grad a : you know ? professor c : right . um , ok . so why do n't you tell us briefly grad a : ok . so th professor c : your give give your e normal schpiel . grad a : um . so this is the project is called meeting recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . um . so my particular interest is in the pda of the future . this is a mock - up of one . yes , we do believe the pda of the future will be made of wood . um . { comment } the idea is that you 'd be able to put a pda at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . so that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . um . so the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . and so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . what the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who are n't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . so , for people who are more interested in language , we did n't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . and then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . um . and so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . so we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . so that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . and then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the ldc . and , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . um . there 's other work going on in meeting recording . so , we 're we 're working with sri , with uw , um . nist has started an effort which will include video . we 're not including video , obviously . and uh and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from ibm . is also involved . um . oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . um . so because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . and it 's exactly the same digit strings as in ti - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus . so we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made . anything else ? ok , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . it should be on already . um . either one of those . and uh , read the digit strings and and fill out the forms . so , the most important form is the consent form , so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent ."
