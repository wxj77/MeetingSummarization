    "answer": "user interface : although i think some of the suggestions we 've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it marketing : mm , right . user interface : and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those do n't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . um , and of course our voice command system which i 've talked a little bit about already and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . and uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that i got from my bank marketing : user interface : has jokes when it 's ready . industrial designer : marketing : nice . project manager : great ."
