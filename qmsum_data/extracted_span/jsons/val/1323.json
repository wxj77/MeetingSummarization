    "answer": "dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . i wanted to ask you about the pay dispute , and i know that you 're not the employer , because i know that 's going to be the first answer\u2014 kirsty williams am : you 're right , that is the first answer . [ laughter . ] well anticipated . dawn bowden am : but we are in a stalemate here and you clearly have an interest in making sure that this dispute is resolved quickly in the interest of the students and the reputation of the colleges et cetera , et cetera . i can see how this dispute has arisen . when we 've seen the teachers ' pay settlement , we 've seen fe settlements in england and scotland higher than what's on the table here . and i am concerned , and i do think this is where the welsh government does have a role , because i am concerned that the employers seem to be using the funding issue as the reason not to have a reasonable settlement with staff . so , they 've walked away from the table , they 've said , 'one per cent , take it or leave it . unless welsh government gives us any more money , that 's the end of that . ' and i 'm really concerned about that , because this is potentially going to have a major impact on whether we can recruit and retain staff in fe colleges . and i look at the college in my constituency , merthyr college\u2014it 's a tertiary college , they 're providing a-level education across merthyr and they 're astounding results they 've been getting as well . i 'm coming round to the question in a moment . it 's really : what more do you think you can do as a government to try to get these parties back round the table and not allow the dispute to become a political football ? eluned morgan am : thanks very much for that . i think , first of all , you 're absolutely right\u2014this is about colegaucymru 's negotiation , but we are keeping a close eye on the situation . i think it 's probably worth emphasising that the reason this has come about , or part of the reason , is because you 've seen that pay settlement in relation to teachers ' pay and we 've had the consequential . so , sixth-form teachers are happy . the people actually providing the same teaching course in a different institution , you can understand why they may say , 'something needs to change here . ' the problem here is that it 's about that , actually , that falls to the welsh government . we do n't have that . or at least it falls to fe colleges to fund that , and it 's up to them to come up with that proposal . we are keeping a close eye on things . i think it 's fair to say that we 'll wait until they get further along down the line , but we are extremely aware of the sensitivities of the situation . dawn bowden am : thank you for that , minister . when you say you 're keeping a close eye on it , have you actually had conversations with colegaucymru ? because i note what you just said there : 'we 'll keep an eye on it and wait and see what 's happening . ' well , all the unions are currently consulting . one has already balloted for industrial action . we could have the other unions also balloting for industrial action . i mean , this is n't something we want in the fe sector , clearly , so is there anything more proactive that government could actually be doing to try to bring a resolution to this dispute ? eluned morgan am : well , we are listening and speaking to colegaucymru , and also we 're aware of what the unions are saying as well . so , i think that 's probably as far as we can go at this point . when they come to a conclusion , and when they come to us and say , 'look , this is the consequence and this will finish'\u2014at this point , we have no idea where that settlement is likely to fall . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : thank you . llyr . llyr gruffydd am : yes , thank you . yes , we would n't expect you to make an announcement on this , because it 's happening outside of government , but there is a principle here , is n't there , in terms of pay equality between schoolteachers and fe ? so , would you not wish to see a situation where we do have greater equality in that respect ? eluned morgan am : in relation to teaching , i think it 's fair to say that we would wish to see pay equality in relation to teaching , yes . llyr gruffydd am : okay , thank you . you emphasise 'in relation to teaching'\u2014my next question is that , of course , within fe establishments you have teaching staff and non-teaching staff , and if there was to be some sort of increase , then would you not expect all staff to have that ? eluned morgan am : well , let 's see\u2014that 's up to colegaucymru to negotiate and to discuss , so let 's see what the outcomes are . llyr gruffydd am : because some of the non-teaching staff are the lowest paid , as well , are n't they ? so , you know\u2014 . eluned morgan am : let 's wait for the outcome of the negotiations . i think we are very aware of the situation . colegaucymru are in that negotiation . we 're aware of what the requests are from the trade union members , and we 'll wait to see what they come up with before responding formally . llyr gruffydd am : could i just briefly as well ask about pensions , because that 's coming down the line , potentially , is n't it , and the impact that 's going to have on fe ? one college was saying it will cost them \u00a31 million if it happens next year . are you thinking about any steps that you could take to support them , potentially , because obviously this is coming down the line , really , is n't it ? eluned morgan am : well , i think , already , we 've got the situation in relation to teachers , and again what we 've seen is the consequential and the uk government honouring that . again , what we do n't have , necessarily , is that money coming down from the uk government for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to . it 's early days on this , but it 's something , again , we 're keeping an eye on . llyr gruffydd am : the fundamental question , really , is : if the money does n't come down the line from westminster , are you in a position to underwrite that ? eluned morgan am : well , we 'll wait until we see that situation arising , but we 're aware that that is an issue that we 're going to have to deal with in future . llyr gruffydd am : diolch ."
