    "answer": "project manager : so it 's marketing : my turn ? project manager : yeah , marketing expert . marketing : okay , it 's alright . project manager : participant two ? industrial designer : four . project manager : four , marketing : four , i think . project manager : sorry . marketing : trend , yeah . no uh yes . okay , so i 'm going to talk about trends and um i hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . so , next slide please . so first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it 's not so uh simple you might think that it 's easy but uh it 's not so simple . anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . we can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired . of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they 're not only watching the trends , they 're inventing it , they 're creating the trend . i hope i 'm going to try to help you on that . this is more risky because you 're not following the trend , project manager : marketing : you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you do n't and you 're out of business . industrial designer : marketing : so anyway uh next slide please . uh to be to be quick there 's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . the first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . and uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . it has to be fancy . strangely enough it 's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that 's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . so as you see uh it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . and finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it 's not so important that it 's useful as a remote control . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : next slide please . uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . if we look back and not uh look at only remote controls i think it 's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like paris and milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel project manager : industrial designer : marketing : or so . industrial designer : marketing : and i think of course uh i it applies to everything . that 's the thing with trends . it it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea . project manager : marketing : fruit and vegetable . think fruit and vegetable . and uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , user interface : what is spongy ? marketing : yeah . well project manager : marketing : this so so i think uh uh i industrial designer : kind of um maybe marketing : when we were talking about rubber , industrial designer : yeah it marketing : i think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it 's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : s so maybe titanium it 's not a good idea . industrial designer : yeah . we need to think about mm mm . marketing : seems not , seems not . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . project manager : um sorry mark . marketing : so project manager : it seems to be marketing : think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , industrial designer : fruit . even shape ? marketing : as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . i mean industrial designer : more project manager : mm-mm . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : and not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm . project manager : hmm . you 're old-fashioned . marketing : so that 's what people seem to yeah i i know it 's quite far from what you thought project manager : sorry . industrial designer : marketing : but that 's that 's fashion and project manager : industrial designer : user interface : okay . project manager : okay . marketing : okay that 's all i have to say . project manager : mm you have questions ? industrial designer : so these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? or it 's marketing : these i 'm sorry . industrial designer : this you you so did you marketing : yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , industrial designer : where ? oh . oh , okay , mm-hmm . marketing : as you know our company is quite big and uh so i 'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends industrial designer : it 's not from mm . mm-hmm . yeah . yeah . marketing : that are also industrial designer : it 's more general trend marketing : well . industrial designer : it 's not particular to the remote control . marketing : no , it 's not it 's not this this is very general , yeah . but it seems that trends travel across things . industrial designer : mm . yeah . marketing : the what we industrial designer : yeah but some materials n they 're to be uh they 're to be something like solid like they ca n't be really spongy marketing : sure . industrial designer : or marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah . marketing : we have to i think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables industrial designer : yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that 's marketing : but we still have to put our chips inside , so of course . industrial designer : yeah yeah marketing : this is your problem . project manager : industrial designer : that yeah yeah . marketing : this is not mine . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , looking yeah fruit . these things can be easily incorporated . we can have t colours or this shape marketing : yeah , i think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . industrial designer : or at least marketing : if if it 's something like rubber made or i think it it 's also going to be good . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : okay ? project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : no more question ? okay . marketing : yep . thanks . industrial designer : yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that 's project manager : you say s industrial designer : we want to follow general trend . marketing : spongy . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : do we agree on that ? yeah . we have to . industrial designer : so , do you think marketing : no , we do n't have to , user interface : so we have to uh for project manager : no . marketing : but seems it 's the trend . industrial designer : hmm . yeah . marketing : again , as i said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . user interface : yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so there 's no well , that 's you t can try to convince us . industrial designer : user interface : well , we can make it smell like fruit . marketing : okay . that 's a good idea , project manager : okay , that 's a good idea . industrial designer : that 's project manager : so titanium smell like fruit . marketing : i user interface : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : industrial designer : so what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? or they really like they more want these fancy features marketing : uh i think i industrial designer : like marketing : yeah i it 's again in this uh what i said first it has to be fancy so i think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it i think it 's a good sell for us project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : feature yeah . marketing : because we have it industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and others do n't . project manager : okay . marketing : it 's fancy . whether it 's useful or not does n't seem to be very important . project manager : i i agree with uh this uh industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like marketing : industrial designer : yeah . uh we will try to explore these two options project manager : mm . yeah , yeah . industrial designer : and marketing : maybe you could explore the two option . industrial designer : yeah yeah . user interface : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . could we make a titanium shape ? i mean fruit-shaped . industrial designer : uh yeah at least like we can make banana or project manager : do n't you say that you can not do double shape uh curved shape user interface : but doub double-curved . industrial designer : yeah it 's it 's marketing : mm . seems to be . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah that 's a we 're to look for project manager : mm-hmm . okay . industrial designer : and and s we 're to see the whether rubber is expensive user interface : okay , okay . in fact i just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . industrial designer : and d hmm . project manager : mm-mm . okay , so user interface : well , okay w we 'll see . project manager : you explore now that you 're going to work together these these two . or or spongy an yeah . industrial designer : yeah . maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or user interface : we 'll see . we 'll see . marketing : if you have time . project manager : mm . yeah i do n't think w i think we have to choose . if we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it can not be both . user interface : we 'll see . i i really do n't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for industrial designer : yeah . marketing : for creation . user interface : i dunno uh yeah um industrial designer : yeah . project manager : user interface : we 'll look . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : project manager : ah you can pretend that it 's uh titanium . industrial designer : even design . marketing : you can paint it afterward . industrial designer : user interface : okay , okay . marketing : no problem . we have a very large department of paint . project manager : yeah , do do n't worry , you you you speak with mm mm . marketing : you will do it . user interface : alright , alright ."
