    "answer": "lynne neagle am : okay , and we are going to come onto children 's rights . but , as you know , minister , the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart . can i ask what assessment the welsh government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic ? vaughan gething am : apart from the general concern that i 've expressed on mental health generally , we are already investigating , we 're having a\u2014 . we 've commissioned , through the government , the delivery unit to work with the national advisory group , including dr ann john and other people , to review the current , unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in wales , because we want to try to understand the wider concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people , and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not . so , that 's why we 've commissioned that review to be carried out with the current numbers of unexpected deaths that we have , so we 're able then to provide a report to understand where we are . my understanding is that we should have a report on that review before the end of this month and , obviously , i know the committee \u2019 s got an interest , so if it 's helpful we can write to you once we 've had a chance to receive the report and to look at it . lynne neagle am : yes , please . thank you . in terms of provision of crisis care , then , how has that been impacted by the pandemic ? are those crisis services available for children and young people who need them at the moment ?"
