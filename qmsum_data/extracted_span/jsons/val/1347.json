    "answer": "phd d : uh - huh . ok . professor e : so . right . phd f : as opposed to the rest of us . phd d : well - { comment } ok . i i remind that me my first objective eh , in the project is to to study difference parameters to to find a a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded . but eh , tsk , { comment } ehhh { comment } in that way { comment } i i i begin to to study and to analyze the ehn the recorded speech eh the different session to to find and to locate and to mark eh the the different overlapping zone . and eh so eh i was eh i am transcribing the the first session and i i have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events , eh besides the overlapping zones , eh i i i mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap , eh { comment } i do n't know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the n speech phd a : nonspeech sounds ? phd d : yeah . grad g : oh , i do n't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail . so . phd d : yeah . eh , i i i do i do n't need to to to mmm to m to label the the different acoustic , but i prefer because eh i would like to to study if eh , i i will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping i would like to to to test these parameters eh with the another eh , eh acoustic events , to nnn to eh to find what is the ehm the false eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the the ehm this eh parameter eh i mean pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature grad g : mm - hmm . phd a : you know i think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there 's two there . grad g : so it was phd d : yeah . phd a : i mean , if it 's a tapping sound , you would n't necessarily or , you know , something like that , it 'd be it might be hard to know that it was two separate events . phd d : yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . grad g : well you were n't talking about just overlaps were you ? you were just talking about acoustic events . phd d : i i i i t i t i talk eh about eh acoustic events in general , grad g : someone starts , someone stops yeah . phd d : but eh my my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone . grad g : mm - hmm . phd d : eh ? { comment } n eh in twelve minutes i found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events . professor e : how many overlaps were there uh in it ? no no , how many of them were the overlaps of speech , though ? phd d : how many ? eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session grad g : oh , god ! phd d : in five eh in forty - five minutes . phd a : three hundred overlapping speech phd d : alm - three hundred overlapping zone . phd c : overlapping speech . phd d : with the overlapping zone , overlapping speech speech what eh different duration . phd a : mm - hmm . professor e : sure . postdoc b : does this ? so if you had an overlap involving three people , how many times was that counted ? phd d : yeah , three people , two people . eh , um i would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background , be professor e : no no , but i think what she 's asking is if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ? phd d : oh . oh . yeah . i consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone . this th i i i con i consider i consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh are talking together . grad g : well so let 's so let 's say me and jane are talking at the same time , and then liz starts talking also over all of us . how many events would that be ? phd d : so - i do n't understand . grad g : so , two people are talking , { comment } and then a third person starts talking . phd d : yeah ? grad g : is there an event right here ? phd d : eh no . no no . for me is the overlapping zone , because because you you have s you have more one eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a in in a moment . professor e : i see . grad g : so i if two or more people are talking . professor e : ok . yeah . so i think yeah . we just wanted to understand how you 're defining it . phd d : yeah . if professor e : so then , in the region between since there there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking . phd d : uh - huh . professor e : and one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event . phd d : uh - huh . professor e : is it are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event , phd d : yeah . professor e : or are you calling the entire length of it the event ? phd d : i consider the the , nnn the nnn , nnn eh , the entirety eh , eh , all all the time there were the voice has overlapped . this is the idea . but eh i i do n't distinguish between the the numbers of eh speaker . uh , i 'm not considering eh the the ehm eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ? eh at first eh , eh two talkers are uh , eh speaking , and eh , eh a third person eh join to to that . for me , it 's eh it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event . wi - but uh , without any mark between the zone of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together , and the zone with the three speakers . postdoc b : that would j just be one . phd d : it one . one . eh , with eh , a beginning mark and the ending mark . because eh for me , is the is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral . professor e : got it . phd d : i do n't mind by the moment , by the moment . grad g : well , but but you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two . phd d : i i do n't yeah , but eh but eh i have to study . { comment } what will happen in a general way , professor e : could . grad g : so . you had to start somewhere . professor e : yeah . we just w phd c : so there 's a lot of overlap . phd d : i i do n't know what eh will will happen with the grad g : that 's a lot of overlap , phd d : yeah ? professor e : so again , that 's that 's three three hundred in forty - five minutes that are that are speakers , just speakers . grad g : yeah , for forty - five minutes . phd d : yeah . yeah . professor e : uh - huh . ok . yeah . postdoc b : but a a a th professor e : so that 's about eight per minute . postdoc b : but a thousand events in twelve minutes , that 's phd d : yeah , but yeah . phd c : but that can include taps . phd d : but professor e : uh . yeah . postdoc b : well , but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot . phd d : general . phd c : actually phd d : i i con i consider i consider acoustic events eh , the silent too . postdoc b : silent . grad g : silence starting or silence ending phd d : yeah , silent , ground to bec to detect eh because i consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech . phd c : oh , ok . professor e : mm - hmm . phd d : in ge in in in a general point of view . professor e : ok , so how many of those thousand were silence ? phd c : alright . phd d : in the per phd f : not speech not speech or too much speech . phd d : too much speech . professor e : right . so how many of those thousand were silence , silent sections ? phd d : yeah . uh silent , i i i i do n't i i have n't the eh i i would like to to do a stylistic study"
