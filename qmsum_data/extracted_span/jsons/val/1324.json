    "answer": "eluned morgan am : thanks very much for that . i think , first of all , you 're absolutely right\u2014this is about colegaucymru 's negotiation , but we are keeping a close eye on the situation . i think it 's probably worth emphasising that the reason this has come about , or part of the reason , is because you 've seen that pay settlement in relation to teachers ' pay and we 've had the consequential . so , sixth-form teachers are happy . the people actually providing the same teaching course in a different institution , you can understand why they may say , 'something needs to change here . ' the problem here is that it 's about that , actually , that falls to the welsh government . we do n't have that . or at least it falls to fe colleges to fund that , and it 's up to them to come up with that proposal . we are keeping a close eye on things . i think it 's fair to say that we 'll wait until they get further along down the line , but we are extremely aware of the sensitivities of the situation . dawn bowden am : thank you for that , minister . when you say you 're keeping a close eye on it , have you actually had conversations with colegaucymru ? because i note what you just said there : 'we 'll keep an eye on it and wait and see what 's happening . ' well , all the unions are currently consulting . one has already balloted for industrial action . we could have the other unions also balloting for industrial action . i mean , this is n't something we want in the fe sector , clearly , so is there anything more proactive that government could actually be doing to try to bring a resolution to this dispute ?"
