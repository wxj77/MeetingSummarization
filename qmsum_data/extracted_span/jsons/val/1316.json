    "answer": "llyr gruffydd am : you have your targets for 2021 , in terms of numbers of teachers coming through the system , which is positive , although , clearly , the report or the review itself said that , actually , we need to double the numbers , really . but it 's not just the trends that are going down ; it 's a cataclysmic drop , really . we 've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are going into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of welsh . so , it 's a huge turnaround that we 're looking for , and i 'm not getting the feeling that the level of ambition and the answers that you 're giving here this morning reflect the level of action that's needed , really . kirsty williams am : well , first of all , as i tried to illustrate to suzy , the figures on their own tell one story , but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak welsh and to be able to use\u2014 llyr gruffydd am : i think it's 40 per cent of those who are currently in the system who don't\u2014 kirsty williams am : \u2014the language and skills . and if we look at qualifiers of ite courses in wales by degree type , actually , we see a different trend\u2014we see numbers going up . so , there are statistics and there are statistics . depending on which ones you look at , it 's quite a complex picture . and that 's why we had the evaluation report . we understand and we know and acknowledge that there is more work to be done . that 's why we have got the evaluation of provision in ite and that 's why we 'll be taking that ambition forward . we know what we need to do . as i said , we 're not sitting back and hoping that something miraculous will change things . we are pulling levers and putting in place plans to improve that situation . llyr gruffydd am : thank you for that . clearly , there are statistics and there are statistics , so could you just explain to us which statistics you 've used for your targets for growth over the next three years ? kirsty williams am : well , that comes as a result of the work done for the 2050\u2014 llyr gruffydd am : upon which baseline are you basing the increases that you 're projecting ? kirsty williams am : we 're using the baseline of 2012-13 . there has been a decline since then . llyr gruffydd am : that 's the one i was using when i said '24 per cent reduction ' ."
