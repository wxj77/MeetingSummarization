    "query": "<s> what did julie morgan think of the monitoring system for the vulnerable children when discussing the priority to care for them ?",
    "answer": "dawn bowden am : thank you , chair , and thank you , deputy minister , because one of the questions i was going to ask was around some of the work that you 've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection , and i think you 've covered that . but what i 'm particularly keen to find out is how you 're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round . i know the health minister raised this as a concern in plenary only recently , and it 's really how we are monitoring it , what concerns have been identified , and how we 're going to start to tackle some of those . julie morgan am : yes . thank you very much , dawn , for that question . obviously , it is difficult to monitor if there 's not easy access to the children that we 're referring to , and that 's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings . and there 's been a lot of encouragement for that happen . the minister , the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities , asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school . in fact , we 've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings , and that 's the highest number that we 've had at all since the opening of the scheme . but it 's still only a tiny drop in the ocean . but it 's very good , and it is progress that the numbers attending are now going up . but , of course , there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing . there has been a drop in safeguarding referrals to social services . those numbers are now beginning to go up , but there certainly was a significant drop , which is a great deal of concern . one local authority , in fact , reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year . so , i issued a written statement on 1 may , setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children , young people and safeguarding work stream , and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are . because , obviously , we are dependent on the public authorities\u2014you know , schools and health services\u2014to report any concerns , and at the moment , obviously , they 're not there to report them . so , we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other , and i was very interested in what si\u00e2n gwenllian told me about what was being done in anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen , and to raise their concerns , because , obviously , safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community . but i think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are , in fact , keeping close touch , as far as they possibly can , with all the children that are vulnerable . for those where it is very critical , face-to-face contact is still taking place , and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families . so , it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it , but i think as much as possible is being done . lynne neagle am : jean , you wanted to come in on that . professor jean white : just to add to what the deputy minister was saying , the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back . it has consolidated some of the ways that it does the healthy child wales programme , but , for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable , all the normal contacts have been maintained , so they 're not unseen to the normal health visiting service . that covers both flying start and general health visiting areas . thank you . dawn bowden am : thank you , jean , for that , and , deputy minister , would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current welsh government definition and guidance around vulnerable children , in terms of who we identify as vulnerable ? because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable . so , it 's just looking at the current guidance that we have . do you think that needs revisiting at all ?"
