i um yeah . i think if we do this , as it 's uh uh c uh it 's really orientates on the design . um , so i would give it a two . industrial designer : me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . but the rest of it is . so , i think a two . project manager : user interface : yes . two . project manager : uh , i say uh a five . it 's not fashion , it 's new . it must be a fashion . but it is n't . industrial designer : it it will be fashion . project manager : yes . it w if it 's not a fashion we can put it in it . so , it must be a fashion . i think it 's a five . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : uh okay . user interface : then make it th three . marketing : okay . yes , i 'll think of that too . project manager : no . oh . industrial designer : 'kay . three is okay . marketing : yeah , agree ?

project manager : okay , two . marketing : two . okay . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : so , well we gon na do the next part . uh , yep . uh uh , the next statement . it has not too much buttons . um , yeah , i i have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . and in the end we calculate an average . so , um that 's why it 's a negative in it . um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . so , um uh did we uh do that ? well , uh if we go to uh this fashion , i we still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . but you can you can go for that . and um that way , you do n't have a lot of buttons over . so , i would give this a two . project manager : you ? user interface : one . project manager : me too . one . marketing : one . um , but where where is the ? industrial designer : project manager : next , six . it does not get lost easily . marketing : so yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?

user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , o one . project manager : okay , a one . next . marketing : okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . uh yeah , did we achieve that . i think with the way it looks and um it is designed , i will give it a two . project manager : yeah me industrial designer : yeah . me too . project manager : that was our target . two . industrial designer : yeah ? yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : right . there 's a fancy look-and-feel . marketing : uh , yes . that that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh trendwatch said . i did n't uh say it in my presentation . but um , well does it have that ? i would say yes . so um well , let 's also give this a two . t industrial designer : i gave this a one because of the rubber . it feels soft . uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . it 's yeah . yeah , f very fancy trendy . project manager : okay . user interface : yes , a one . project manager : i say a two . it 's a a bit personal . if it 's fancy . user interface : marketing : yeah . project manager : so i think s two is better . user interface : yeah , okay . industrial designer : two is okay . marketing : okay . two . industrial designer : . marketing : and um , then the last one i could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends . project manager : no , it 's new . innovation . marketing : if we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we did n't uh we did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . so , i would did not give this uh a one or two . i we 'll go for a three . project manager : . industrial designer : i go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh i said in my presentation . uh but the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . something what also younger people want . it 's also a trend , so i 'll give it a two . project manager : okay . user interface : mm , three . project manager : me too . three . marketing : a three . project manager : yeah . marketing : okay . so um , come back to the presentation now . so , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . project manager : effort is three , ten and twelve . thirty , forty , fifty , . marketing : so , we will do that . yes . project manager : twenty one . so , it 's uh two and three nine two and one third . marketing : by nine . yeah . um , uh okay . two . come on . industrial designer : project manager : uh , nah . okay . marketing : so uh , that 's a pretty low rating , i think . user interface : yes . marketing : project manager : so , it 's good . marketing : so , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . project manager : okay . user interface : project manager : thank you . industrial designer : yeah , i think . marketing : oh . nah . how am i doing ?

um , so if uh i 'll have a look . we have a battery . one battery . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : cheapest there is . project manager : okay , one battery . electronics . advanced chip . industrial designer : expensive . project manager : yeah it 's the most advanced . chip-on-print . we have that one . industrial designer : well , it 's the most advanced . project manager : we have the simple , regular and advanced . industrial designer : advanced . project manager : we have the adva advanced . 'kay , so uncurved or flat . nope . single curved or double curved ? we have double curved . industrial designer : project manager : so industrial designer : marketing : project manager : then we have plastic , wood , rubber . industrial designer : project manager : we have half rubber , half plastic . user interface : mm , yes . project manager : no titanium . special colour . yes , yellow . industrial designer : uh , yellow . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm , yeah . project manager : interface , push-button . scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or lcd display . industrial designer : project manager : so , we have the lcd we have two scroll-wheels ? or one ? and it 's not really a s industrial designer : joystick uh thing . marketing : . project manager : yeah , it 's this one . now , uh button supplement . industrial designer : project manager : special colour . we already uh , that 's the from the for the buttons . the buttons are regular colour . user interface : mm , yeah . project manager : so , then uh then then then then then then then industrial designer : we 're not gon na make it . project manager : uh , no . it 's too expensive . industrial designer : yeah . wh project manager : so , we have to change something . industrial designer : what what are the costs ? project manager : fifteen euros . industrial designer : fifteen . project manager : yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it 's okay . 'cause we ca n't lose the battery . we ca n't lose the advanced chip . we ca n't lose the double curve . we have rubber , special colour . marketing : . we would have uh n industrial designer : a special colour . project manager : oh , no , we industrial designer : uh , i do n't think it 's a very special colour . project manager : no , it 's uh sorry ? industrial designer : yellow ? uh , is it a special colour ? marketing : for a remote control . industrial designer : what ? marketing : i 've for a remote control , i think it is . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : if we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . for up down left right . project manager : um , then we uh lose two euros . then we have thirteen euros . half a euro too much . exactly the special colours . so industrial designer : and what if we use only one sort of um um just only plastic or only rubber ? project manager : that 's one euro . industrial designer : one euro discount . project manager : so , i do n't think that 's good . mm i think we have to keep the lcd . if industrial designer : if we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . project manager : yes . then it 's only thirteen euros . industrial designer : and then we 'll lose fifty cent in what ? project manager : so uh yeah . yeah . then you have or you have to cut this off . industrial designer : uh uh-uh . project manager : then it 's not good anymore . so , wait . okay . i 'll have a look . we industrial designer : and if you say it 's just a r uh normal colour it 's a normal colour , wh project manager : yellow rubber . industrial designer : no one will see it . project manager : yeah , normal . industrial designer : normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . project manager : uh industrial designer : and it 's twelve euros , i think . project manager : one minute , please . uh is it maximum . um yeah , it 's normal colour . but if you lose the joystick , it 's still uh an advanced chip ? industrial designer : no . uh , no , no , no . project manager : or it 's then a regular ? industrial designer : uh oh , wait wait wait . marketing : the advanced chip was for the lcd was n't it ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : oh yeah . project manager : so , the advanced is for the lcd and the regular for the joystick . industrial designer : oh yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : and what if we lose the lcd ? industrial designer : if we lose the lcd , then we have an uh regular chip and no lcd . project manager : yeah , regular chip . but is it a good design ? industrial designer : uh , yeah . then you 'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . and you do n't have the lcd . marketing : if uh industrial designer : so , the tvs has to uh have to be up-to-date . marketing : if we have the n no buttons if we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have uh , we have thirteen euros ? project manager : mm , yes . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and then uh we move the the colour . what will that be ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : then it 's okay . industrial designer : huh . no knew that . marketing : yeah . project manager : okay , so no joystick . oh no , but we then we get push-buttons from half a euro . industrial designer : yeah , then it 's twelve euro fifty , then it 's okay . project manager : uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . no joystick . push-buttons . no special colour . twelve and a half euros . then it 's okay . so , we have to change that a little bit . and you can not use the red and green button . because if you give them a s uh colour , user interface : okay . all the same uh project manager : you have to pay point two euros . industrial designer : so , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour . but then the print on it will g um change it . make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . uh l how you call it ? user interface : mm , yeah . recognisable . like what industrial designer : recognisable , yeah . user interface : yeah . mm , yeah . project manager : so industrial designer : yeah ? user interface : okay . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so well now we have to change that , but that 's okay . rubber . what 's the normal colour ?
