    "answer": "phd d : sure , because i i need a lot of time to to put the label or to do that . yeah . professor e : yeah , i mean , we we know that there 's noise . phd d : uh - huh . professor e : there 's there 's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth , and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth phd d : yeah . professor e : and and something in between with paper rustling . we know that all that 's there and it 's a g worthwhile thing to study , but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things . phd d : yeah . professor e : whereas th i i would think that uh you we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking . phd d : uh - huh . ok . ok . professor e : so . then you can get the cuz you need if it 's three hundred uh i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really phd d : yeah . professor e : and and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of of what 's going on , much less any kind of reasonable statistics . grad g : right . phd c : now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the grad g : well , that 's that 's what i was gon na bring up . phd c : i mean , you should n't need to do this p completely by hand , professor e : um , ok , yeah . so let 's back up because you were n't here for an earlier conversation . phd c : right ? i 'm sorry . professor e : so the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the lpc residuals , such as i mean there 's a bunch of things i mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one . phd c : mm - hmm . in the far - field mike . professor e : yeah . phd c : oh , ok . professor e : um , and uh , it 's not obvious , i mean , you could you could do the dumbest thing and get get it ninety percent of the time . but when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gon na give you the you know , the right detector . so the idea is to have some ground truth first . and so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say `` ok this , i you know , it 's it 's really here `` . phd a : but i think liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ? phd c : what i mean is get it from the close - talking mikes . professor e : uh , yeah . phd c : a or ge get a first pass from those , professor e : we t we t w we t we talked about that . phd c : and then go through sort of it 'd be a lot faster probably to phd f : and you can grad g : yeah , that 's his , uh professor e : we we we talked about that . s but so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is , phd c : yeah , i just professor e : the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway , and and then whatever he could mark would be helpful , phd c : right . professor e : and we could uh it 's a question of what you bootstrap from . you know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better , or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then then do your simple measurements , uh from the close - talking mike . i mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gon na get it right all the time . phd c : well , that 's what i wonder , because um or how bad it is , be um , because that would be interesting grad g : i 'm working on a program to do that , and phd c : especially because the bottleneck is the transcription . right ? i mean , we 've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for . we have the audio data , we have the close - talking mike , professor e : yeah . phd c : so i mean it seems like one kind of project that 's not perfect , but um , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know , if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech , professor e : right , we discussed that . phd c : you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ? grad g : and i 've i 've written a program to do that , phd c : ok , i 'm sorry i missed the grad g : and it , uh professor e : it 's ok . grad g : and so but it 's it 's doing something very , very simple . it just takes a threshold , based on on the volume , phd c : uh - huh . phd f : or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand . phd c : right , by hand . yeah . phd f : yeah . grad g : um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs . and , it seems to work , i 've i 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something , and i have n't i do n't what i 'm working on was working on was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , into transcriber . and so i told i said it would take about a day . i 've worked on it for about half a day , grad h : i have to go . grad g : so give me another half day and i we 'll have something we can play with . professor e : see , this is where we really need the meeting recorder query stuff to be working , because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and i 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided , phd c : right . i 'm sorry . i just professor e : but i could n't remember all of it . so , i think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when when he he gets his thing going , grad g : but professor e : uh , and phd c : well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it . i was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of postdoc b : mm - hmm ."
