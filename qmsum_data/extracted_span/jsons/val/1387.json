    "answer": "marketing : so so i 'm uh gon na have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . and we looked at uh several um things . uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . uh well what what will be our market . and uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . if um that would be a good idea or not . well our findings . uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . um uh they especially found found them very ugly . and um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . uh well they also zap a lot . so uh zapping uh should be very easy . and uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . so a lot of unused buttons . there is more findings . uh on the buttons . which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? and how much would they use them ? well uh the most used button is the channel selection . and uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . the power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . uh not important they found the audio , uh that 's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . uh the screen and the brightness . and uh channel settings . uh th and they also are not used very often . then we have a few um graphs about the market . uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . and to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh i do n't think uh , i i think the younger will be most interest in it . but uh they are not a very big group . um in the we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . if you have an lcd on the remote control , what would you think of it . now you can clearly see young users say . i will that would very nice . and older user think uh they will be scared of change i think . industrial designer : marketing : and they wo n't like it . and another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . well here we see the same . young users uh think that 's an interesting idea . and old users not . uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim . uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . and um they are more critical on their money spending . uh the second group is the older group . aged between forty six and sixty five . they are less interested in uh new features . but uh they spend their money more easily . now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . and the second group about forty percent . so the the first group is bigger . well then i come to my uh personal preferences . uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group does n't say that old people wo n't buy it . but less of them will buy it . um well i uh okay . what i thought , um even young people say it 's hard to use , remote control . so if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that 's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . and um we can make special features . but uh i think it looks nice in the first time . but when use it , uh i do n't know what 's uh good thing of speech recognition . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : um well th uh that 's my second point . industrial designer :"
