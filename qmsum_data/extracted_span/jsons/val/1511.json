    "answer": "marketing : it 's my turn . project manager : yeah , let 's see if uh th it 's meet the evaluation criterium . marketing : mm-hmm . let 's see if this yeah , if you meet the evaluation criterion . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : oops . marketing : industrial designer : fudge . marketing : yeah . so , evaluation please . so . you made a very nice prototype , and um , i think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that . so mm uh , next slide , please . as you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control , it 's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . to so what i propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . one meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . and seven meaning , no it does n't fulfil at all . and we 're all l going to list all the criterion . i 'm going to go to that next slide , project manager : okay . marketing : and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . and then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . so , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? industrial designer : fancy . marketing : so these are the criterion uh i 'm i thought were important . of course , this can be discussed , but let 's let 's see , so let 's vote . so we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , what 's is really marketing : what do you think , is it fancy ? industrial designer : uh , it 's really project manager : uh , i think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . marketing : it is very very fancy . or have you ever seen something like that ? project manager : oh . i am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . marketing : yeah , of course . project manager : uh what do you think ? marketing : what do you think ? user interface : feel the weight . marketing : is it the weight is later . industrial designer : yeah . oh . user interface : really . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : now we 're user interface : okay . marketing : we 're on the fanciness now . i think it 's quite fancy . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : we can give at least five or six , seven . marketing : it 's uh yeah , so no it 's it 's one . project manager : it 's in the other . industrial designer : oh , oh . so oh , okay . yeah , okay . oh , okay . so marketing : yeah , o one means it 's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . project manager : mm . marketing : so it 's one or two . project manager : two . let 's say two , yeah . industrial designer : m maybe two . marketing : what do you think ? two ? user interface : two . two . marketing : okay . so here , two . up . industrial designer : technology . marketing : then we have uh technology . industrial designer : yeah . um marketing : so , what about technology ? we have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based , industrial designer : and we have lcd . marketing : we have lcd . project manager : change colour of t industrial designer : so you change colours . marketing : change colour , i mean that 's very industrial designer : useful . project manager : yeah , i think it 's a user interface : yeah , yeah , yeah . marketing : d i think it 's a one for that , at least . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . uh industrial designer : yeah , yeah . it 's silly . marketing : at least a one , yeah . project manager : mm-mm . marketing : robustness , uh-huh . industrial designer : uh , still we need to cha marketing : so let 's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away . project manager : um marketing : do you think it makes sense that it 's going to live again ? uh , maybe not the prototype . project manager : the strawberries industrial designer : yeah , it project manager : oh . marketing : let 's try . oh my god . industrial designer : maybe strawberry . marketing : okay , we just lost one strawberry . so user interface : no . how can i say this . marketing : not at all ? industrial designer : yeah , we can easily plug it . user interface : it 's still it 's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . marketing : it is yeah . yeah . user interface : a strawberry . marketing : so it 's not so bad . project manager : mm-mm . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : i um uh i would say three . project manager : yeah . but it 's too . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it 's um robust , yeah . marketing : yeah , that does make sense , yeah ? industrial designer : useful ? marketing : useful . well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? industrial designer : yeah , marketing : so i do n't know . these buttons are uh it not clear . project manager : oh , yeah , lets me try . marketing : but you have at least uh next produce . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : what is uh next , please ? industrial designer : yeah , channel . i this is volume control and channel changes . these are the main marketing : uh , it depends on the project manager : and you can uh do di two sites ? marketing : okay . industrial designer : you project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , and you can do on lcd using these going to scrolling all the option . project manager : okay , also . industrial designer : so if you do n't want marketing : so but , for instance , because the lcd is not uh touch control , touch screen , you can not go to channel twenty five directly . industrial designer : yeah , um yeah . project manager : you can , by using the user interface : you can . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : directly . user interface : you go you project manager : you c push here the the user interface : so , the basic mode project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . so that 's simple . the basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . marketing : yeah . user interface : with two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . marketing : oh , it 's a jog dial , okay . user interface : or if you go to the site , it 's channel up channel down . industrial designer : and channel . marketing : uh-huh . okay . user interface : and if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this . marketing : yeah . user interface : you select twenty , you select five . industrial designer : you can select . marketing : okay . user interface : that 's it . industrial designer : yeah mm . marketing : it 's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? do n't you think so ? may not okay , we can go . that 's uh you 're right . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , yeah . y you need to like press two and five and yeah . marketing : that 's it 's less uh yeah . but it 's it 's nice , because people anyway do n't go there . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . yeah mm . marketing : but so what do you think for it , usefulness ? industrial designer : so , d yeah , we need to address we want marketing : seems to be useful . industrial designer : we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on lcd . so project manager : let me understand well , industrial designer : so project manager : because i 'm not sure that 's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . marketing : both . yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . up . marketing : up down or left right . yeah . project manager : yeah . and which what is that ? user interface : it 's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the lcd screen . industrial designer : this is jog wheel . marketing : that project manager : okay , okay . it 's a kind oh , okay okay . user interface : like , selecting the menus . industrial designer : yeah . um , see in lcd , like you will have blocks and you select which one . marketing : cool . project manager : oh oh okay , great . marketing : i would say then uh project manager : now it 's looks us useful . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : two or three ? project manager : yeah . marketing : two or three ? industrial designer : two , maybe . project manager : yeah . marketing : okay , two . so size and weight . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : is it the the the effective size and weight that the is it uh real size , real weight ? or because it industrial designer : yeah , it 's size al almost marketing : size is going to be that , yeah ? industrial designer : yeah , because it is marketing : uh , and and industrial designer : the weight will be bit lighter . we will s we use titanium . user interface : sure , project manager : mm-mm . user interface : without titanium alloy , it 's going to be light . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . yeah . marketing : it 's going to be lighter , project manager : user interface : of course . marketing : because this seems to be very heavy f i mean , industrial designer : heavy . yeah . marketing : for my daughter , for instance . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : not sure if uh she can use it . industrial designer : but sides uh , the sides should be okay . . yeah marketing : so , should be okay . up to three for that , project manager : mm-mm . marketing : because i 'm have n't seen the weight so i must not uh user interface : okay . okay . project manager : marketing : colour and shape . project manager : uh-oh . marketing : well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the lcd . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : but um , it 's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the case is silver titanium , no ? marketing : it 's a it 's going to be titanium . okay , okay . project manager : yeah , it 's . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that 's nice . project manager : let 's imagine . marketing : i think it 's good . okay . project manager : and what about the strawberries on the top ? i 'm not convince . but maybe i 'm not trendy . but , uh marketing : yahoo . well y you know , it 's this uh fruit and vegetable year . industrial designer : oh . yeah , yeah . yeah . project manager : yeah , but uh uh they 're not useful . marketing : so project manager : i i mean it that 's uh industrial designer : so maybe , i think marketing : uh , i think usefulness is m as as i rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , well marketing : whether it 's fancy or not now , it we have to decide . industrial designer : yeah . um marketing : but this project manager : i would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful . marketing : if it 's uh-huh . so , that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , well then it 's bit difficult to use . not like this d we 're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . project manager : mm-hmm . but the n yeah . industrial designer : so , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . so it 's marketing : so , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh industrial designer : even project manager : no , i 'm not sure uh why industrial designer : these buttons project manager : uh if it was like this industrial designer : but it looks really not really good . project manager : i it 's n no , it 's not fancy any more . industrial designer : i mean , the f yeah . so these are kind of rubber things . even if you lose one you can just put whatever . project manager : okay . user interface : and industrial designer : even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and project manager : uh-huh . and different routes . okay , i see what user interface : moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . even if it is , you know , it 's very rounded , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it 's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay , so you you you feel like it 's something uh a protection for the remote control . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah , we 've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here , project manager : also . industrial designer : so we just yeah , so even if you do n't put , it works . but this is really fancy . project manager : okay . marketing : i suggested three . project manager : okay . marketing : because uh , everybody s does n't seem to be convince , user interface : okay . okay . marketing : although it 's quite industrial designer : yeah . marketing : you have good arguments . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but project manager : okay . marketing : and uh the last one is adaptive . this is not r maybe not as important as the other one , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ? user interface : sure , sure , just look at it . it 's full adaptable . marketing : great . project manager : wow , that 's a marketing : fully adaptable . user interface : yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know . marketing : that 's yeah . so you can fit into your palm , okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that industrial designer : you can marketing : what else can we need ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : you do you think you are gon na be able to do that with ti titanium as well ? project manager : yeah , it 's fudge titanium . you know . marketing : it 's fudge , yeah , yeah . project manager : right , yeah . and uh user interface : mm , marketing : yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . well , i if if this is if you are ready to do that , then i think it deserves a one . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . let 's go for one . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : now we have to do the average . industrial designer : three , three , six , eight , eleven . marketing : who is good in math ? user interface : it 's two point one seven . marketing : okay . two point one seven . that 's nice . two point one seven out of seven . i think we have a good good thing . project manager : yeah . marketing : well , that 's all i had to say about the evaluation . project manager : so it 's a good evaluation . marketing : so it seems to be good , yeah . project manager : yeah . mm . industrial designer : yeah mm . marketing : we have uh industrial designer : yeah , two one one seven , we have . so marketing : yeah . project manager : mm-mm ."
