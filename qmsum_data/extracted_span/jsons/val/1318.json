    "answer": "hefin david am : the decision by the education workforce council not to accredit the university of south wales with the ability to deliver teacher training\u2014what are your views and concerns about that ? kirsty williams am : the process is independent of government , and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that , especially as i understand that there is an appeals process that may be being undertaken . what i would say is that from the very outset of our ite reforms we have made it very clear that i expect very high standards in our ite system , but the process is independent of this government . i have confidence in the people who have been appointed by the ewc to undertake that process , but it is independent of me , and it 's not appropriate for me to comment on that further . hefin david am : i fully understand that and the need for distance for the ewc , but there 'll be an impact on students and staff . students , first of all : are you concerned that the reduction in providers might have an impact on students , and those students going through the second year at usw ? would you have concerns about that issue ? kirsty williams am : in terms of the overall numbers , we will be looking to commission from those institutions that have been accredited the number of training places that our planning tool says that we need . so , in terms of an overall number of places , we will commission from those accredited units . clearly , there will be a responsibility upon the university of south wales to ensure that those students already in the system are able to complete their studies and their course , with the appropriate level of support and tuition to enable them to achieve their career aspirations and to graduate from that programme . hefin david am : and what about the uncertainty for staff , or would you say that 's an issue for the university itself ? kirsty williams am : these are autonomous bodies . they have to act accordingly , in compliance with any employment law or any statutory responsibilities that they would have as an employer . that 's not a matter for me ; that is a matter for the institution that is an autonomous body . hefin david am : but i would be surprised if you were n't keeping an eye on this , given that it has been a key provider . are you aware of when the appeal decision will be known ?"
