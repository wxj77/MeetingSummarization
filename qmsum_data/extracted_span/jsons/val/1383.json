    "answer": "industrial designer : first uh i will tell you something about the findings , what i discovered about the remote control . the working bout it uh of it . uh then i 'll have uh some kind of map , and it 's the top of the remote control . with a little bit of science , uh you i will show that uh in in a few minutes . and then uh what i 'll think about it . first , the findings . the remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who have n't seen a remote control uh inside . uh there 's a lot of uh plastic on it , marketing : industrial designer : um because its uh not so expensive . and there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . there 's a lot of small uh electronics . so it wo n't be um uh too expensive to build it . only twelve euro fifty i think uh we will make it . now and here i have the top of the remote control . uh here 's some kind of chip . uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . uh you have all on your remote control . and uh the teletext uh button . and uh here 's the battery . and when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . and the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . that 's what i said , it 's very difficult . project manager : industrial designer : and after that it will be sent to the infrared . and that will send it to your television . that 's a short h uh how it works . uh i think i can uh make it uh difficult , but we all we all do n't get it . my preferences ? it 's uh it wo n't be uh we should n't make it too big . uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . a long-lasting battery . uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . not other materials . also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . we can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button . and then um that that you will see it on the tv . and on the tv you can uh switch into the menu . user interface : mm-hmm ."
