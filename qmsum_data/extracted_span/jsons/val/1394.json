    "answer": "project manager : it 's in the well uh next um i dunno who is next . user interface : oh you go . industrial designer : shall i give a technical talk ? alright . project manager : well go ahead . industrial designer : well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . we have that here . okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the project manager : f_ five . industrial designer : f_ f_ five . project manager : f_ five . user interface : industrial designer : well , the working design , marketing : alright . project manager : industrial designer : that 's my uh marketing : next button . industrial designer : well alright uh , you know who i am and what i do . so uh we have this . it 's a bit uh unclear because i wanted to copy paste something . it was originally in black and white marketing : oh right . industrial designer : but it became black and purple . marketing : purple . industrial designer : but i think you can read it . user interface : project manager : marketing : yeah , yeah , yeah . a bit . industrial designer : um well um i think it 's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . uh well you can see uh marketing : maybe you can select it . so it uh inverts . industrial designer : and i then can select i can select on the dings it goes to the next page . marketing : the p the whole picture . project manager : click . marketing : nah , uh never mind . industrial designer : well , you can read it , user interface : yeah , go ahead . industrial designer : it 's not too difficult . meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . you have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the led , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . marketing : yeah . alright . industrial designer : and uh the source is of course the user . uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course . user interface : industrial designer : and the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the led , and the led sends it to the receiver . that 's the that 's the basic idea . very basic . marketing : industrial designer : um well i have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps . project manager : industrial designer : uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . it does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . the key a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . uh and recognise the key . so well you understand . project manager : industrial designer : the chip uh produces morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . and it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the led , which is the bulb , of course . project manager : industrial designer : now the led produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it 's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the tv set , project manager : yeah . marketing : industrial designer : and the tv set uh also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task . project manager : so it is also why we have to have a button that says uh i 'm now busy with a d_v_d_ uh if we had done that . and a button for tv . so industrial designer : ah bu yeah , but we do n't . uh we user interface : industrial designer : no no , but yeah . exactly . uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . project manager : industrial designer : i 've some couple of pictures here . it 's a very basic one . and uh if we if we 're going to add an uh an uh lcd screen to it , it uh wo n't look anything like this , but this is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . it has uh very little buttons and user interface : industrial designer : but it it uh it 's it 's quite um yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . they 're uh far enough apart and an anything . it 's not very um uh not very high-tech uh user interface : high tech . industrial designer : indeed , and it 's not very user-friendly . uh if you look at the shape , it 's uh just a simple long box uh shape . so we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh r_s_i_ and uh those kinds of thing do n't do n't oc do n't occur . marketing : right . can i say something ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um i have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . well teletext is not an option , so that uh industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : but i think it 's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you ca n't have r_s_i_ uh consequences . industrial designer : yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately marketing : right . make them big , make them easy to uh to press . project manager : well but but user interface : you can also like industrial designer : you do n't have to look and and search for them . project manager : if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . marketing : right . user interface : yeah , i was thinking you can marketing : yeah , right . right . project manager : but if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , user interface : project manager : and that 's on of the things about r_s_i_ . user interface : are some of the the the um marketing : yeah , that 's right . that 's right . that 's right . industrial designer : well you you ca n't have any uh every button under the thumb , of course . project manager : no but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject r_ r_s_i_ r_s_i_ . marketing : but yeah . that 's very important . and user interface : maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . like some uh little uh gameboy things or some project manager : yes i 've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . marketing : but is that is that useable ? do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? project manager : user interface : well marketing : it 's a f it 's a new feature , project manager : well it it 's industrial designer : yeah . marketing : you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . user interface : yeah alright , but project manager : well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote user interface : yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they 'll understand it , i think . project manager : yeah . if someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he 's a already on the next channel . user interface : eighty per cent would . industrial designer : well , . marketing : yeah , he feels it immediately . project manager : that 's very irritating , i think . user interface : yeah that 's true . marketing : yeah , that 's right . yeah . user interface : yeah but marketing : right , continue . industrial designer : but in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . marketing : sorry . industrial designer : i think that 's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they do n't use it uh all the time . well it 's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said . and i have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh i do n't want to get too technical , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : because uh that 's not uh very uh useful for you . project manager : that 's your part of the job . marketing : yeah , that 's right . industrial designer : so yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . and uh well that 's about it i think . oh yeah , i still have this . oh i had to delete this , but i had to make a schematic uh of the of the new marketing : alright . project manager : okay . industrial designer : but i had too too little time , marketing : industrial designer : but uh do n't uh do n't look at it please . user interface : project manager : well we understand . industrial designer : i i think it 's it 's clear uh how it works . marketing : alright . project manager : we understand . marketing : yeah , it 's clear . project manager : oh right , no . industrial designer : alright . that 's the most important thing . project manager : nice . then uh mike can uh give the third presentation . industrial designer : alright . uh project manager : how late is did we start his presentation uh ? industrial designer : right . marketing : i dunno . i think uh w about twenty minutes ago ? project manager : wha yeah . marketing : losing time losing time . project manager : well then we have still the time , so but we do have to come to a decision , right later on . marketing : yeah right . so project manager : so user interface : well i thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing , but obviously that 's not the case . marketing : i do n't think so . industrial designer : yeah , uh there are different uh we have all have different home pages , with different links . project manager : oh yeah ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah right . user interface : for instance you could n't see this . project manager : okay , yeah well . user interface : um yeah . well i 'm mike , user interface designer . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : the the method ? well i used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . project manager : yeah . user interface : um marketing : these are already in use ? user interface : yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . marketing : alright , okay . user interface : um this one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : um marketing : well project manager : i like user-centred . marketing : yeah , me too . user interface : i like user-centr centred uh uh also the best . project manager : yeah . we also do that . user interface : um well , i thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the d_v_d_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . uh so i thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . marketing : but we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? user interface : but yes . project manager : yeah . user interface : th that 's why this mm is not relevant any more i feel . project manager : marketing : alright . user interface : um i think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we 'll need . marketing : yeah , right . user interface : i um i kinda like the shape . i think this is what we talked about . but industrial designer : you ca n't really see uh the differ from different sides . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but i think uh user interface : no i 've well i showed it somewhere . um industrial designer : uh you can draw it if you yeah . user interface : oh yeah . i think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so we can can uh yeah customise the project manager : well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . so we can not just uh make someone w user interface : mm ? yeah . it 's a front . it 's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . project manager : no but that 's th the side they look uh look at is the front . user interface : you can marketing : but it project manager : so if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . marketing : yeah , that 's right user interface : or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . marketing : yeah , that 's a must . user interface : so l like ericsson does every uh project manager : yeah , we must . industrial designer : we can put it on the on the back side . marketing : we must have that . project manager : yeah well and and user interface : s something like this . it 's recognisable . project manager : 'kay . user interface : um marketing : we can make a symbol of the company right here . and if you put a front on it , there 's a hole on the front . so the symbol 's always on user interface : yeah ? industrial designer : yeah , so that you do n't replace the symbol , yeah . project manager : yeah yeah yeah . user interface : yeah yeah . something like that , project manager : or the th the the lowest part of the remote is n't changed by the front . user interface : in the yeah . marketing : yeah . yeah , yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : those kind of things . user interface : yeah . marketing : but let 's not focus on the front . project manager : yes . okay . user interface : um well so uh uh like i said i thought we 'd we 'd use more function . if we we had to include more functions . but we do n't . so um project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . i think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . marketing : alright . user interface : maybe some less . like eject we do n't need , and some other buttons we do n't need . i think uh industrial designer : mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the word documents file ? in map ? user interface : yeah , i will . i think uh for the remote um uh less is more . the less buttons the better the design . um project manager : yeah . user interface : we should go with that concept i think . marketing : yeah , i agree . user interface : i know . project manager : alright . marketing : i 've i 've got another point . project manager : yeah ? marketing : um there are two target audi audiences , and we 've uh chose for the younger one . um , research has shown that um it 's a high interested uh in features . they are high high interested in feature . but they are more critical . fo yeah , critical . industrial designer : the younger uh marketing : so the younger audience . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : so we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . project manager : well what if we um i at i at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : a f a little uh you can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people do n't use but s some do do . industrial designer : mm-hmm . i think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh marketing : clip are n't used much . project manager : well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , industrial designer : no um mm usually marketing : yeah right . industrial designer : but project manager : but not user interface : yeah , but what kind of features ? like lcd screens and voice recognition . industrial designer : yeah i think m most marketing : yeah but yeah . user interface : but i 've industrial designer : most uh marketing : here , look at these numbers . the newest features are , like i said , are uh lcd and uh speech uh control . our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . uh . marketing : you see ? so we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . project manager : competitors . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . our competitor . yeah . marketing : the concurrent ? competitors , right . project manager : marketing : so , i do think we have to uh have some features . project manager : yeah . well maybe w we could uh s marketing : even though they cost a little more . project manager : on um some uh calculators you have lo those little little lcd th that you can click on or something , marketing : right . right . project manager : or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . and if if that 's gives you a little bit of sta status information . marketing : like a ticker-tape . project manager : yeah . marketing : which programme you are l watching or something . user interface : yeah , that 's nice . project manager : those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your v_ v_c_r_s . and uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you 're currently watching . marketing : yeah , right . yeah right . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . so it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your lcd screen . project manager : for example . it it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . user interface : yeah , we should keep that simple too . project manager : yeah . user interface : it will industrial designer : but should it uh really be uh clickable , uh project manager : well maybe . marketing : no not clickable . user interface : no , it should be uh integrated . industrial designer : or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . marketing : nah , no no no . user interface : i think marketing : yeah , just at at the top . so when you s you sit like this you can can watch . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah , marketing : i think it should be at the top . user interface : something like on um some radios in car . you where it 's , yeah , walking to yeah . marketing : yeah right . it 's a ticker-tape idea . project manager : r_d_s_s or something . industrial designer : but that 's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing . user interface : wa yeah . project manager : well i think it 's you got it just means it 's a script that 's uh keeps it uh rolling , marketing : well it 's just one script . project manager : and it 's not uh that 's five minutes off uh implementing time i think uh marketing : yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . project manager : yeah . user interface : marketing : so i do n't think that 's the issue . industrial designer : alright . marketing : alright , we go with the lcd screen ? project manager : uh well i think so , yes . um user interface : yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . marketing : 'kay . right , i do n't know if i can find that , but project manager : we 're g no but we 're we 'll have to look into that . user interface : or maybe you will get that information uh project manager : um we can use this board again , i think . marketing : next time . yeah right . user interface : yeah . project manager : uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . where is my presentation ? uh marketing : yeah , i understand what you 're saying . project manager : uh marketing : we should have a general idea of how it 's gon na look . project manager : well i mean we 're all here now , i think . these i 've already given you . so we have to decide on the different remote control functions . so we want to have a small lcd screen that 's special . marketing : right . at the top . industrial designer : should n't we start with the most important parts ? user interface : at the top or at the bottom ? industrial designer : the lcd screen alright but we should start with the power button ? marketing : i think the top is more uh project manager : yeah . industrial designer : uh user interface : yeah but marketing : when you s how do you zap ? project manager : marketing : you just sit in your chair ? project manager : user interface : yeah but with with the lcd screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . marketing : with the remote ? project manager : that thing is terrible . user interface : 'cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . marketing : yeah but that 's where your hand ball might be . project manager : uh user interface : yeah , no mm . marketing : yeah , i dunno . industrial designer : and then uh marketing : we 'll draw two , and then we 'll see uh industrial designer : maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . i dunno what uh you were talking about but marketing : no industrial designer : we are busy with something . marketing : um he thinks yeah , right . he thinks it 's better to put the lcd at the bottom , and i think it 's better at the top . project manager : well industrial designer : uh-huh . why do you think it 's better at the bottom ? user interface : uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . marketing : but your industrial designer : but you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there 's room for the for the interface . marketing : yeah . user interface : well i d i think that 's that 's ugly but marketing : the the ticker the lcd is like like small . it 's it 's wide . industrial designer : uh-huh . marketing : it 's not not high . but project manager : well i th i think mike mike has a point , user interface : i th industrial designer : and and we can project manager : because um when when uh when i use a remote i l i hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . user interface : yeah . power button always yeah . yeah . industrial designer : bottom . project manager : so and and i i like to use the ones on the top . user interface : yeah , y you got ta zap like this or you want to yeah . project manager : so when i u when i have to have an lcd s scr window marketing : yeah right . but we 're making a remote with with a few functions you know . industrial designer : well that 's a bit exaggerated . well , i agree with you . it 's it 's also more recognisable . it looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . marketing : project manager : yes but we we we we do n't want that . user interface : yeah you do n't want project manager : we do n't want them to look like a calculator . user interface : you want uh yeah it it it must be a remote . project manager : we want to look it like our original but familiar industrial designer : yeah w well , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : but uh you do n't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , marketing : high-tech . project manager : yea industrial designer : uh because i think it 's uh marketing : project manager : maybe a bic uh better uh white uh we white ? industrial designer : i think it 's still important to have it at the top , marketing : width . project manager : width . uh format yeah format ? line width ? width ? industrial designer : because it 's uh it 's more familiar that way . marketing : th that 's not a problem . project manager : yeah ? marketing : when i draw here it user interface : marketing : oh . huh ? project manager : it 's a bit off . marketing : yeah , it 's off . project manager : well . industrial designer : a little a little bit . marketing : it it needs to be calibrated again . well project manager : well uh let 's uh talk about that later uh industrial designer : maybe you should another pen . user interface : industrial designer : maybe that 's uh better . you e you only have one pen for that screen . yeah . marketing : where ? project manager : it 's special pen . marketing : alright , we have to make a decision now , project manager : yeah . marketing : because we do n't have much time . um i think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the lcd above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . industrial designer : yeah . i i agree . project manager : i think it should be at the button , bottom . bottom . the lcd . user interface : at the bottom ? industrial designer : well i 'm the i i 'm the designer , so um user interface : in a few minutes marketing : at the bot user interface : oh yeah , oh yeah , i totally agree . yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : so we are two uh v_s_ two . project manager : well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , user interface : he 's the boss . project manager : and then look at the design . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : right . great . industrial designer : uh we uh we were busy with that . project manager : because we have to decide this . industrial designer : uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so , we have the power button . marketing : and moreover i think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the lcd s . it 's uh your it 's your job . project manager : well we have a power button . industrial designer : yeah of course . uh it 's uh . yeah . w wh user interface : no it 's our job . project manager : guys ? user interface : for all of us i think . industrial designer : while you have to agree , i can say it 's like this and you must agree . yeah . marketing : yeah , right . project manager : guys ? marketing : alright , let 's keep it central . project manager : we have a power button , setting buttons , lcd window , the number buttons user interface : the ten numbers ? yeah ? industrial designer : channel , yeah . project manager : uh user interface : volume ? industrial designer : volume control . um"
