    "answer": "marketing : yeah yeah user interface : marketing : so a lot of people have to be able to use it . industrial designer : no but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh marketing : so user interface : easy to learn . marketing : yeah . yeah that 's right . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise . user interface : yeah . project manager : i 'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well i 'll put it in the project uh folder when i 'm done uh just now . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : i also think we should not add too many buttons . industrial designer : alright . marketing : right . project manager : no that 's right . user interface : modern day uh remotes have too much buttons i think . project manager : y y you do n't use uh the half of them that 's that 's user interface : precisely . project manager : culture uh international . marketing : maybe we could make one button to switch between d_v_d_ player and tv user interface : yeah . marketing : and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . user interface : yeah indeed . industrial designer : yeah so it does n't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh marketing : yeah right . project manager : yep , and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a d_v_d_ player . do n't we have uh other uh ou user interface : yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ? industrial designer : and stereo uh s uh audio installations . project manager : we also uh just uh released a t_f_t_ uh thing i saw . marketing : yeah so but th that 's kind kind of standard t_ television so it also works on that . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . and i think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . so we can keep that in mind . industrial designer : most people do , yeah . project manager : well yeah . industrial designer : it does n't project manager : it does n't have to be , but we can . user interface : industrial designer : it does n't have to be user interface : w well it 's a n it 's a new remote and you do n't buy a remote if you do n't have anything to uh to control with it . project manager : well except if we deliver it together with our d_v_d_ . marketing : yeah but industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah alright , but marketing : we need to to keep it consistent with other d uh project manager : yeah because we look at competitors industrial designer : well . project manager : and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design marketing : yeah but it 's it has to be useable . industrial designer : it has to be different and familiar at the same time . user interface : yeah . yeah marketing : yeah . user interface : we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . industrial designer : yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . i thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing project manager : yeah . industrial designer : you can make it uh triangle shaped , user interface : well we we could make more more oval or something , and and industrial designer : but that 's not uh very recognisable . marketing : no . industrial designer : oval ? project manager : n we can use uh it as a as a game pad . user interface : yeah or so industrial designer : i project manager : so one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh user interface : well yeah it 's new . industrial designer : mm . marketing : . not with two hands . user interface : marketing : yeah yeah yeah , right . user interface : but young people want something different marketing : no user interface : and it is project manager : well i we already uh marketing : yeah but it 's quite important that it fits . project manager : one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : oh but it ha it has to be m marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . but you still have to know it 's a remote and not another project manager : well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh user interface : yeah alright . project manager : because it 's a long time uh on the market . so the the form will have been uh tested out so industrial designer : yeah . yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful project manager : yes . well industrial designer : or else uh they would have been ano another shape . project manager : for me personally i have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle i do n't like to use them . i have uh have to it has to fit my hands . marketing : yeah . project manager : when it falls over it and i just have and then the button that i use most has to be here . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah marketing : it should n't be boxy . industrial designer : a lo the long box shape yeah . you have to use one hand . project manager : it f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb . marketing : nah i do n't agree with the long box uh shape industrial designer : why not ? marketing : it it has to be custom made for the hand . user interface : yeah it does n't fit . project manager : tho tho those new d_v_d_ players on the market do have those . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , marketing : yeah but if you shape it industrial designer : but then you have user interface : no if y if you look at new phillips uh d_v_d_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes are n't box shaped . marketing : if project manager : d_v_d_ players . yes . marketing : industrial designer : w no w what else ? marketing : no that 's ol old fashioned . user interface : well yeah . industrial designer : yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ? user interface : yes uh marketing : i can imagine that us user interface : well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . marketing : yeah right . it fits in your palms . industrial designer : hmm . well but it 's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand , user interface : yeah it project manager : well a it h it has it it has a that 's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . industrial designer : but it 's it 's still yeah yeah al alright project manager : that 's industrial designer : but but it 's still it 's still sort of box , yeah . marketing : . user interface : yeah yea industrial designer : it it has round forms marketing : well industrial designer : but it in the end it 's still the box , so that 's what i mean . marketing : yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . industrial designer : yeah yeah i understand , but no no i do n't mean an entire box like completely square marketing : it should n't be too boxy , you know . it 's project manager : marketing : no no no . user interface : industrial designer : but a also with round edges of course , user interface : . industrial designer : but in in in at the end it 's still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit . marketing : yeah . project manager : marketing : right maybe something like this industrial designer : yeah yes marketing : and then a button here to switch between different systems like d_v_d_ player industrial designer : i thought about something like that . yeah . marketing : and so you can i 've industrial designer : a big recognisable button on top or something . marketing : yeah right , and i do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and user interface : yeah . project manager : we have five minutes left . industrial designer : the buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , marketing : right . user interface : industrial designer : and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . project manager : uh that 's yep . marketing : but it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . industrial designer : uh-huh . marketing : so there has to be some space between the buttons . industrial designer : yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . marketing : yeah . yeah right right , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and maybe we should use colours . user interface : yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them , industrial designer : colours , yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs marketing : that 's kinda trendy . yeah right . project manager : sound nice . yes . user interface : i dunno but industrial designer : i think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um project manager : well it 's just uh about our first ideas now user interface : well industrial designer : . project manager : so i think individually we 'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . industrial designer : marketing : right . but industrial designer : already thought about something tha marketing : i think it 's uh it 's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , so we project manager : well thirty minutes we have . so um user interface : industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : this is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . you 'll get specific instructions when you 're back in your room so uh it 's uh logical uh . i think . marketing : yeah . user interface : . marketing : no problem . project manager : oh and uh that 's uh that 's all . so we 'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . industrial designer : yeah now we can still talk about the material , project manager : yeah yes say . industrial designer : we have some some minutes left uh i w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery i think uh . marketing : yeah . yeah it should n't be too heavy . user interface : . project manager : well i have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons user interface : . industrial designer : no n n project manager : and when i 've had use it much it was gone . so it has to be made in the buttons i think . user interface : yeah that 's bad , yeah . marketing : yeah yeah yeah . project manager : it has to uh not be loose . user interface : yeah that 's important . industrial designer : mm . alright . and of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other . project manager : yeah . is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it 's all about uh industrial designer : i think so . marketing : yeah it 's univ yeah yeah yeah . industrial designer : it 's a a common stan standard way project manager : it 's not that in china it 's different ? industrial designer : infrared beams an infrared beam i think . project manager : yeah . but y you can have uh of course different between d_v_d_s and televisions and between marketing : and you can use industrial designer : it it 's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . but our tvs are mostly made in china and that sort of country , so project manager : probably yes . marketing : project manager : china rules . user interface : industrial designer : and have well yeah i 've wrote something down about how it works . the user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , project manager : marketing : but are industrial designer : but that 's pretty obvious , i think . project manager : user interface : marketing : are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ? project manager : well i think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . marketing : i think we should make it universal project manager : yeah . marketing : and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? you can use it just plain user interface : . marketing : but you can to make it more trendy . project manager : well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the user interface : yeah . marketing : right . user interface : yes . yes . marketing : right . project manager : and we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh marketing : yeah . user interface : well you can make profit with them , and it 's a way to make them trendy . project manager : well th those fifty million do n't uh do n't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh . industrial designer : well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something user interface : yeah alright . marketing : yeah right . user interface : yeah normal . industrial designer : uh b a simple colour not not very flashy . project manager : yes . yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and d_v_d_ set we are going to sell , user interface : no a colour everyone accepts . project manager : so if they are uh black and black black and silver we 'll make them black and silver so industrial designer : pink television sets pink remote , . marketing : yeah yeah yeah . user interface : yeah . standard . marketing : but people of often do n't like bright colours or something . project manager : . marketing : we have to make it grey or s or black . user interface : well young people s li marketing : yeah but then you can use a a front . user interface : yeah yeah , yeah . industrial designer : alright . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i must not forget my pen the next time . project manager : well if if you yeah . user interface : project manager : if you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they 'll they 'll love it . i think . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah that 's right . project manager : but that 's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . marketing : yeah or a t teletubby front . yeah yeah yeah . i will investigate . project manager : yes . well our user interface you can uh maybe uh i do n't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . and you will look into the technical design and um form , i think . industrial designer : mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote 's also my task , yeah ."
