    "answer": "hefin david am : but do you anticipate a capacity problem with the \u00a34.50 in those areas , compared to , say , the cynon valley ? huw irranca-davies am : we ca n't anticipate it yet , hefin , but that 's exactly the reason for going into that area and then assessing how it works . we 're reasonably confident that the \u00a34.50\u2014 . we 're reasonably assured by the feedback that we 're having that the \u00a34.50 might work as a universal amount . but if we learn , when we roll it out in cardiff and newport , that there needs to be some variation , we can look at that , because we 're not doing a big-bang approach . so , that is part of why we will move to roll it out within cardiff and newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it , but at the moment , i have to say , the \u00a34.50 amount has been welcomed\u2014it 's appropriate . you touched on the other aspect , though , of the wider aspects of beyond the \u00a34.50 , because the \u00a34.50 does n't cover everything . the \u00a34.50 is a contribution towards the wraparound childcare element but it does n't cover\u2014and we agonised over this\u2014the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this . now , we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are . i have to say , this has n't been ivory-tower stuff ; it 's been in discussion with the providers but also parents . one : parents are quite used to\u2014with childcare settings and play care settings and so on\u2014the idea that providers are quite different . some providers charge a fee that does everything in one ; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents\u2014and i 'm used to this as a parent myself , although mine are older now\u2014'mr irranca-davies , when you sign on , just to be aware , if we do take your kids down to st fagans , there 's going to be a little bit of a charge for that ' and so on . hefin david am : that 's fair enough , but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that , because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons , the lower income ones wo n't . is n't that a concern ? huw irranca-davies am : if money was absolutely no object , then i think you 'd be looking at quite a different offer , but it has to be affordable within what we 've got as well . the fact that parents , including those who are on lower incomes , are used to currently discriminating between providers , not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well , where very often schools now will say , 'we 're doing something extra'\u2014 hefin david am : that may be the case , but it 's not fair , is it ?"
