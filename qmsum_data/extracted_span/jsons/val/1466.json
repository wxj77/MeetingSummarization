    "answer": "project manager : now let 's talk about uh interface . user interface : okay . uh participant number three . project manager : three . industrial designer : three . user interface : uh project manager : which one ? industrial designer : marketing : hmm . user interface : mm mm uh have a look at this project manager : industrial designer : user interface : no it 's yeah . project manager : okay . user interface : uh so the concept of the interface . generally i developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user 's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your tv and remote controls . so let 's start with this . we got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons marketing : user interface : and uh we got explanation for every button industrial designer : user interface : and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the lcd is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , i do n't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm i i do n't remember project manager : mm . industrial designer : marketing : user interface : so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? or no ? i can see nothing . so that 's our concept . it 's called the millennium remote control . project manager : marketing : let 's change millenniums . industrial designer : so user interface : yeah . industrial designer : maybe you can use in the end and marketing : does n't make sense . this is very ugly . user interface : really ? project manager : user interface : i thought you like it . ah okay marketing : oh no , user interface : just press the button , please uh . marketing : too much concept . industrial designer : uh marketing : user interface : yeah , we will not use this . we will not use this . project manager : user interface : but instead of this i will devise that 's our concept . industrial designer : marketing : ah , back today . industrial designer : user interface : and it 's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . project manager : mm-hmm . 'kay . user interface : and uh what will people say ? they 'll say it 's perfect . or what will say ? uh they will say it 's splendid . and uh e everyone will say i 'll buy it . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : do you think it can come in several colours ? user interface : and everyone 's gon na be satisfied . marketing : or did the user interface : i would make a backlight of the lcd screen with different colours . marketing : um but not the case . user interface : not the case . marketing : uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , user interface : yeah . marketing : like project manager : because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , well they like uh something which is uh user interface : okay , so let 's remember there 's a nokia phone which changeable panels . marketing : mm yeah , okay , user interface : do you like it ? marketing : so that would be the option . i do n't know i do n't have a nokia phone , project manager : industrial designer : but it 's uh marketing : but i do n't use that but again , uh i might user interface : that 's why you do n't have it . that 's why , marketing : yeah , user interface : 'cause it 's nasty . marketing : bu but project manager : industrial designer : but it would be expensive , no ? if you use colour lcd . uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . user interface : um , i am here . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so users have different i mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so we can just if they want they can just pay another two euro . project manager : uh-huh , okay , so user interface : 'kay . project manager : you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on lcd , industrial designer : yeah . yeah yeah yes . if they want like uh so that we can yeah . marketing : kind of upgradable uh remote control . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . marketing : wow , wow . industrial designer : just they 'll get few more things and few more colours . user interface : okay , what uh there 's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , industrial designer : lights , yeah . project manager : and thermodynamic also . mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : like a chameleon . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah . user interface : we can make it in fact . project manager : yeah but that 's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah . user interface : if if if the okay . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version , user interface : mm-hmm , mm-hmm , project manager : but industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so marketing : because uh i think there are two kinds of people . those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh i 'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it 's like a signature . my remote control is pink . nobody else than me has a pink remote control . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : uh-huh . industrial designer : marketing : and that makes me special . project manager : and you think that we do n't have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is industrial designer : marketing : i think i think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . project manager : okay , so marketing : those who wanted to have it pink . project manager : so i it 's not uh a s base service industrial designer : uh marketing : no mm no . project manager : it 's a user interface : be an option , yeah . marketing : it might be optional , yeah . project manager : okay . industrial designer : but those people will be really few , no ? so like we can those marketing : the the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . although similar but have something just slightly better . pink project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so m so industrial designer : mm . project manager : maybe that 's if that it 's a selling point maybe it has to be the base . user interface : yeah , yeah , marketing : mm . yeah . user interface : yeah . but you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time . project manager : and you 'll be different . user interface : and it makes you different , industrial designer : marketing : yeah , yeah . user interface : you know ? marketing : you always have your remote . project manager : uh in the train uh , hello uh no . want to change my neighbour . user interface : anyone has their remote controls here ? marketing : oh , you do n't ? yeah . you do n't have your remo user interface : no ? industrial designer : marketing : wh you you know like for instance take the ipod . it 's a kind of remote control . uh it 's white user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : and it 's so white that you see it from any anywhere . it has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like user interface : okay . marketing : just because it 's a colour that we do n't usually see in a remote control . white . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : uh-huh , uh-huh . could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ? marketing : seems important . user interface : that they can use it in darkness , like . hand light , marketing : mm glow in the dark , project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : so industrial designer : maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something marketing : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so that like at least um project manager : iradium ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : okay . okay . industrial designer : yeah , marketing : project manager : ah sorry . mm . industrial designer : that project manager : okay . so mm user interface : okay . s well , marketing : okay . user interface : let 's go on maybe with the presentation . marketing : yeah . uh-huh , yeah sure . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : and um the remote control 's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? project manager : user interface : and uh industrial designer : user interface : i dunno marketing : user interface : that 's a question to you and to mm to marketing : well so i heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that 's the smartness of the thing . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : currently we do n't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition industrial designer : marketing : but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . user interface : okay , okay . industrial designer : marketing : i dunno . project manager : mm , that 's a nice world . user interface : so just just just just think about it um . marketing : user interface : thank you . marketing : do n't touch the remote . project manager : okay . marketing : but yeah . are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? so for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father does n't want . user interface : uh yeah i just want to say it should be real smart . marketing : like with some maybe fingerprint recognition or user interface : voice recognition is quite tough . i say do n't use it , and the control just looks . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : 'cause i ordered jus to l to l lock it . marketing : um mm . industrial designer : uh that mm that could be feasible i guess , like so since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use marketing : okay . so it could be smart in that way . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : mm . okay . marketing : but for instance th i i 'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . s since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you 're more often uh things like that industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , sure . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : and provide you ways of using them , i dunno , somehow , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i dunno , that might be expensive project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh it 's marketing : that might also be a good sales pitch again . project manager : marketing : the remote that knows you . project manager : user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : project manager : okay ."
