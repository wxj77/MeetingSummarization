    "query": "<s> how did the prime minister debate about the delaying of the government 's response towards covid-19 ?",
    "answer": "right hon . justin trudeau ( prime minister ) : mr . chair , we knew from the beginning of this pandemic that we did need to move extremely quickly , and that 's what we did . we rolled out the canada emergency response benefit extremely quickly . eight million canadians have had that as a replacement for paycheques lost because of covid-19 . we also moved forward on the wage subsidy and a range of other programs to support workers and small businesses . what we 've done in terms of helping small businesses with the canada emergency business account has had a massive impact on small businesses across the country , but we understand that certain companies and businesses have particularities that mean it 's a little more difficult for them to qualify . we are working with them through their regional development agencies , and we encourage them to approach their local rdas , which will be able to help them get the money they deserve . hon . andrew scheer : mr . chair , these are very simple technical fixes that can be made by this government . there 's no excuse for the delay . it 's may 27 . they 've known about these problems for weeks . they 're trying to get patted on the back for actions they took back in march , and yet they are letting so many canadians down by not making these very simple changes . for example , companies that have acquired another company in the last year have employees whose jobs are threatened . the businesses are not allowed to qualify for the wage subsidy because their revenue is now counted together . we have identified this gap . again , it 's a simple question . will companies that have acquired another company still be allowed to use the wage subsidy to keep workers on the job , yes or no ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , i know that there are many different types of businesses across this country that need support . we have moved forward on supporting as many of them as we possibly can , and we continue to work on filling gaps . i know the member opposite has talked to me a number of times about a tractor company in his riding . i can assure you that finance officials are engaged with that company to see if there 's a way to make sure we 're getting them the support they need . hon . andrew scheer : it 's actually a very simple fix . i can save him and his officials a lot of time . the government used the word amalgamation when it announced the changes to that program . he can make this very clear , and save a lot of work , just by including the word acquisition . will he do that ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , i can assure you that finance officials are working closely with brandt tractor . they 're continuing to work with a range of businesses across the country that , for various reasons , are not able to apply for the help we have now . we will continue to work to make sure people who need the help get it . hon . andrew scheer : mr . chair , it 's literally one word . we can email him the text . we can send him the page in the dictionary where that word is defined , if that would help . another gap that is letting people down is in the rent relief program . the government has set the parameters to qualify for the rent relief program for companies that have experienced a 70 % revenue loss . there are untold thousands of businesses that have experienced a 50 % , 55 % , 60 % or 65 % loss that are ineligible but have no capacity to pay the rent . we called on the government weeks ago to have a more flexible sliding scale to allow more companies to access this program to keep more people on the job and more businesses open . will the government introduce some flexibility to this program to help more businesses survive ?"
