    "query": "<s> what did grad f think about intermediate categories ?",
    "answer": "grad f : right . well , i was , um , i think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while i was thinking that i had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away . but what i 'm thinking now is , i would start with with a reasonable set . something something like , um , um like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to just to start off that way . and do some phone recognition . um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . look at then i would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , ok , well , i could probably reduce the errors if i included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . that would that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . and then and then reiterate . um , build the intermediate classifiers . uh , do phoneme recognition . look at the errors . and then postulate new or remove , um , intermediate categories . and then do it again . phd a : so you 're gon na use timit ? grad f : um , for that for that part of the the process , yeah , i would use timit . phd a : mm - hmm . grad f : and , um , then after after , uh , um , doing timit . right ? phd a : mm - hmm . grad f : um , that 's that 's , um that 's just the ph the phone recognition task . phd a : yeah . grad f : uh , i wanted to take a look at , um , things that i could model within word . so , i would mov i would then shift the focus to , um , something like schw - switchboard , uh , where i 'd i would be able to , um to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes , phd a : mm - hmm ."
