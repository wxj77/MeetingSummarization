    "query": "<s> what did the group talk about the touch screen under the limitation of the budget ?",
    "answer": "project manager : right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , i figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . um . based on what nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um i think , i dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? marketing : i think it 's our most marketable feature just because it 's so new and it 's something that is showing up in other places . project manager : 'kay . 'kay . marketing : but can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : right ? industrial designer : my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it 's gon na cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote , project manager : to produce each one . user interface : industrial designer : yeah that 's just an estimate though . marketing : piece . user interface : oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects . industrial designer : marketing : i know user interface : you industrial designers . industrial designer : i know . project manager : hmm . industrial designer : it 's fun . marketing : and our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? project manager : well . marketing : do we remember ? industrial designer : i thought there was some flexibility with that . marketing : okay . project manager : there is , it 's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we 're gon na have to increase the price to make money . marketing : can we justify it ? project manager : um , from twelve fifty if we d wan na get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five . if you multiply seventeen fifty by two that 's thirty five . marketing : right . project manager : so user interface : where do you guys come up with these numbers ? industrial designer : that 's just off the top of my head , project manager : from the board , industrial designer : it is pending further emails . user interface : marketing : user interface : industrial designer : right . project manager : um , well marketing : though i think that 's what people would pay for , user interface : marketing : i mean if you 're gon na pay for an expensive high class remote , you 're gon na expect it to do something project manager : that 's true , i mean industrial designer : it is the new it would be in a class of its own . marketing : yeah . project manager : and that 's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we 're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we 're gon na make i mean we we 're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just could n't , not for twenty-five euros , marketing : right . project manager : so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that 's something that we can have finance deal with . um , i say that we provisionally go with the touch screen marketing : yeah . project manager : or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter ron ? user interface : i 'm thinking that 's uh definitely a good idea and i also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh marketing : see if we can cut some corners . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : right . well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . industrial designer : it 's true . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : we could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on marketing : right . it 's a starting point anyway , so . project manager : no we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there 's always the opportunity , if it 's gon na be about the size of the ipod or whatever , you know , w we yeah , i guess we can play around with it a bit . alright , let 's let 's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here . so user interface : i mean i think that we really have two main selling points , i think that our casing and the voice recognition marketing : yeah 'cause with voice recognition i mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . project manager : the voice rec thing , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : i mean , if if we 're looking at bottom line , now we 're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , user interface : project manager : i think we might have to drop the voice rec . marketing : i think we 'd have to decide between 'em definitely . project manager : yeah . user interface : to be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , marketing : price-wise . user interface : i mean we 've we 've come up with this , with this new voice marketing : true . user interface : we 're using it for our coffee machines already . marketing : we 've already got it . user interface : i can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall . sounds good . project manager : hmm . what do you think on it nathan ? about the voice rec ? industrial designer : i think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it 'd become the rolls royce of remote controls basically . it would be very nice . marketing : pretty much . user interface : i mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . marketing : right and they said they wanted voice recognition . course , maybe they had n't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we 're not gon na use it even though we know it 'll sell is a call i do n't think i can give the highs ups . like really i ca n't go in and say no we 're gon na just ignore everything we know . project manager : yeah . user interface : does having both really up our costs ? project manager : i ca n't see how it would n't , i mean , there 's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . you know , you ca n't you ca n't have all three . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . project manager : it 's just impossible . marketing : yeah . project manager : well if we 're gon na pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . um . otherwise , yeah , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive . what which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? marketing : well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . but uh i i i personally would tend to another direction but if that 's what 's gon na sell i think that 's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . industrial designer : i would have to side with that , project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : i think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it 's ready to go , it 's packaged , it 's project manager : what does the cost look like ron ? is it cheaper to do the v_r_ or to do the uh touch screen ? user interface : well my p is project manager : nathan ? industrial designer : um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but i think the voice recognition would they 're both mm they 're both gon na push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we 're not gon na have to do as much design work marketing : right . industrial designer : and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what i mean . project manager : right . marketing : right . project manager : user interface : um , i definitely have to agree with that last comment . marketing : and we 're still not then we do n't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we 've already got . in a lot other ways too . project manager : okay . so i 'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . okay . marketing : i think it 's our lower risk option project manager : yeah . marketing : which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option . project manager : okay . sorted . industrial designer : project manager : we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition ."
