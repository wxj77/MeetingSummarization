    "query": "<s> why did the marketing think they should have lcd when presenting the market trends ?",
    "answer": "industrial designer : i dunno if it is the right point to take it up . w uh lcds are basically for feedback , right , to the user who 's pressing buttons , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an lcd on the remote ? marketing : depends how fast your television runs , really , do n't do n't you think ? i mean we 've got one of those um telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the tv and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . and if you get the number in wrong , then it 's a bit of a pain , industrial designer : right . marketing : so i think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . but like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit . industrial designer : right . project manager : it it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you do n't interrupt the picture on the screen , marketing : you know ? yeah . project manager : so if you 're watching something industrial designer : that 's true , yeah , that 's also marketing : and i it would be like i mean if you could make it integrate with the tv then it could come up with new information about what 's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than project manager : yeah . rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : right . marketing : but um i think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen 's protected so it does n't actually get scratched . industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : so you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . project manager : yeah . marketing : so you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that industrial designer : mm right . marketing : and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , project manager : and then you can flip it open . industrial designer : okay . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so now we seem to have a consensus that lcds are definitely the way to go because of style and project manager : yeah , i think so ."
