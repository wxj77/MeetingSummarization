i i did n't s see anything about it , marketing : yeah . project manager : so i already uh thought you uh you were to do that . industrial designer : project manager : so the you 're uh . marketing : project manager : i 'll show you how we 're going to do with financing this uh design . industrial designer : yeah , that 's important too . yeah . project manager : and then we 'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . user interface : bit late . project manager : because uh well we 'll see about the costs . um we 'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close . industrial designer : alright . project manager : well the finance uh we 'll do later , so um firstly uh i 'll show you the notes . i do n't think it 's very interesting . user interface : i think it is . project manager : oh nei . uh no . alright . this is copy paste . so industrial designer : from me of course , yeah . project manager : of course . you had some very strange layout . industrial designer : well from us all , yeah , from all of us . yeah . it 's a nice chorus , yeah . project manager : well um user interface : marketing : project manager : we ge we went through the agenda , industrial designer : project manager : and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . and uh i summarised what you said to us . so uh i do n't think it 's very interesting and go through it again . industrial designer : repeat it yeah . alright . project manager : so uh this is what we decided . it 's also copy paste from what we made together . so we still know that . marketing : okay . project manager : and then uh we can we can uh use the time better . well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . industrial designer : alright , we both uh will ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : or one of us will ? user interface : alright . industrial designer : uh user interface : no you go and i 'll uh supplement you . industrial designer : alright . if i make mistakes uh you 'll uh user interface : yeah . project manager : correct . industrial designer : right . uh well this is our design . marketing : industrial designer : uh it 's pretty uh much uh like uh mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . with uh the different uh perspectives of it . uh we 'll begin uh with the front . we have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . um with uh the upper part being the front . th so there 's this part um which is made of hard plastic , the front . and uh we 're we 're using different colours . of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and later we 'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . fancy colours . um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device . uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it 's also titanium . you can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . user interface : yeah , it 's a double r_ , but industrial designer : yeah ? user interface : it 's a double r_ . industrial designer : it 's a double r_ . yeah the logo user interface : but it 's very difficult to to draw that in yeah . project manager : yeah , alright . industrial designer : uh uh it 's difficult to draw so small , but it 's our double r_ uh logo is in there . project manager : okay . yeah . industrial designer : um so that 's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . then we have the buttons . uh it 's difficult to draw again the little oval or round i think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . user interface : oval yeah . project manager : alright . industrial designer : so uh oval , n those are here . and then we have the m the m user interface : channel up and volume ? industrial designer : yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons . and also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . we have the okay button . oh nei we uh the okay button 's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and then we 've here the menu button and the project manager : alright . user interface : menu for the lcd screen . industrial designer : and the video button . the project manager : so marketing : mm right . user interface : industrial designer : yeah . and of course this low part , this is the lcd screen . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : uh this is what we made of it . you can make uh suggestions uh if you want . project manager : well if i look at it , the side the side view user interface : well , at the back industrial designer : maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and then you can add suggestions . project manager : oh yeah alright . yeah . industrial designer : maybe i i do n't want to i do n't want to suppress you but n i 'll uh finish this uh quick . um okay i 've had everything i guess on the front ? user interface : no the back . with the logo and our uh l uh industrial designer : yeah the back . yeah . we thought about yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . and we thought about the logo big in the middle . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : just so again the double r_ . we have then the logo on front and on the back . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : maybe that 's too much project manager : okay . industrial designer : but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . user interface : no i do n't think and the industrial designer : and the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : that 's basically what we were thinking about , project manager : okay . industrial designer : and user interface : and about the side view um this the front wo n't be as thick , industrial designer : user interface : but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh project manager : well i see , but industrial designer : oh and uh before i forget . yeah the the voice , of course , project manager : well . yeah i see it . industrial designer : the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . and you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . marketing : project manager : when i look at uh when i look at this side view , i think w when i have that in my hand , it 's terrible . user interface : well , it wo n't be visible . mm ? project manager : if if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . but industrial designer : why ? well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : mean uh the the the the project manager : well what what what i what i agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . marketing : yeah , i agree . user interface : if y if you handle a remote , you you usually do n't have your hand straight like this . industrial designer : in the middle in the user interface : you you have it a bit uh yeah . marketing : it depends on the size . if it 's kinda small , this is is great . but if it 's it 's larger , then you want to grab it . project manager : and how large is it ? user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , that 's the question . industrial designer : that 's the question . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : uh well yeah . h what do you suggest i mean we do ? this was mike 's prototype , project manager : well uh marketing : industrial designer : and y you seemed to agreed on it . project manager : well the sides i have n't seen yet , uh ? industrial designer : but now you have a totally different . user interface : well , they lay there all the time . industrial designer : the size ? yeah well the size does n't really matter w i mean project manager : they the the the the the side view , industrial designer : side ? uh oh the side ? project manager : we did n't uh industrial designer : w we we he drew the s the side , user interface : yeah yeah . industrial designer : but you d you were n't paying attention as usual . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : well any case , we 'll discuss it now . uh i think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea . marketing : yeah , i agree with the lcd screen . you have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . and if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . project manager : yeah . user interface : industrial designer : but you you hold it like this . user interface : yeah you you do n't you do n't grab it , industrial designer : you 're not holding it like this or something . user interface : you you industrial designer : you , yeah , y how do you call it ? yeah . project manager : industrial designer : well y y y you do n't have it like this . project manager : no no no . industrial designer : you have it more like this . user interface : industrial designer : you you you 're using buttons this way , or if you 're right-handed , this way . marketing : like you 're holding your telephone . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so you yeah . so marketing : because if you have a screen on it , you wan na look at your screen . user interface : hmm . that way , it it falls into your hand . i think . industrial designer : yeah well project manager : okay . industrial designer : and maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , marketing : yeah , i agree on this . industrial designer : so well project manager : marketing : no , i do n't think so . that 's not uh the point user interface : no but but industrial designer : well the the well that 's a reason to to to put the lcd screen uh of course on the upper side , but user interface : well f for as far as i can see , three of us agree project manager : yeah well user interface : and only nils project manager : uh i think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that 's it . user interface : but you 're the project manager , you can make the hard decisions . project manager : yes . so uh i c i c industrial designer : if necessary . project manager : well , we 'll we we 'll do it like this . industrial designer : but uh are d can you live with it ? uh project manager : alright , if you think that that 's the way it should user interface : yeah ? industrial designer : y yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . project manager : no no , industrial designer : but do you project manager : when i i my personal taste is that i want it to fall over my hands with a thick but in the market uh industrial designer : but d you do n't think this is completely unusable i guess . i think . project manager : no not totally . industrial designer : not totally , well project manager : for me , i i would n't buy it . let 's say it like that . industrial designer : yeah but of course y you are also human . we have to take uh every everyone into account . so project manager : no marketing : and you might be uh you might be target customer . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yes but industrial designer : well uh who who else thinks like you ? we do n't know . project manager : yeah , we do n't know , industrial designer : maybe a thousand people , project manager : but that 's uh that 's that 's that 's more market research . industrial designer : or a million people . marketing : project manager : so let it be like this at uh at this moment . industrial designer : let it be . user interface : project manager : okay ? industrial designer : alright . so that 's that . user interface : industrial designer : uh any other suggestions ? project manager : no , i think it 's great . marketing : yeah . user interface : but what about the redesigning ? project manager : comes to that later . user interface : okay . project manager : um you . uh c you can uh walter . you can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ? user interface : industrial designer : you 're very personal again . marketing : alright . great . user interface : project manager : that 's more useful than just speaking . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : well , this is just a short intro . i 'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . that 's gon na be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : so i made a i made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . well , i put some questions in a word file . see if i can find them . uh uh uh uh mm . project manager : 'kay . marketing : well i uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh i do n't have to explain it . uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . seventy five percent of them . so what do we think ? industrial designer : well d we designed it , so of course we are very project manager : yeah , we 're we 're not quite uh objective about this . marketing : yeah user interface : well we designed it to be good-looking . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : no , i know , but i have to uh evaluate it . so i have to take this questionnaire . project manager : to the customers ? industrial designer : so and we ha we have answer now ? project manager : to potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah yeah , but i ca n't can s project manager : nei . oh no . i know , i know , i know . but um well we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . uh do we find it good-looking ? well we think so . uh user interface : yeah . we designed it to be good-looking , so industrial designer : i yeah , i think it marketing : yeah , but uh , you know we dis we di we designed it to be perfect . project manager : yeah . user interface : marketing : so but we have to be critic critical about it . and i have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . so we we know where we stand . project manager : well , one . marketing : 'cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten . project manager : well so it 's point four . easy to find t industrial designer : well l well let 's start with the beginning , just one by one . marketing : right , so right . uh is it good-looking ? industrial designer : well , i guess uh i think uh it 's uh it 's it 's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . project manager : two . industrial designer : that was our target audience of course . but it 's also not completely um uh u unacceptable for older people i guess . uh it 's it 's not f a device that marketing : the titanium might be uh f for older people . industrial designer : yeah , that 's that 's uh for older people , it 's it 's more that classical look . so marketing : it you put uh put a black front on it or something . industrial designer : uh no . i think yeah they like black of course , but i think they 'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also uh i think it 's also good for them , so i think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . so i think it 's very good-looking marketing : right . industrial designer : and not only for youth uh young people . user interface : i think we should n't discuss any points points that long , because i do n't know how how many points there are but uh project manager : no . i totally agree . marketing : right . industrial designer : yeah , the fourteen yeah . project manager : we we have to get get on , go through this . marketing : right , a number please . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : is it easy to t change channels ? yeah well i think so . marketing : so the last one is seven . user interface : um , no it 's uh marketing : easy to change channels ? project manager : no , not false . it 's one . marketing : oh , sorry . user interface : marketing : yeah , right . project manager : well uh two ? y well we have to go through it . marketing : change channels ? industrial designer : i think it 's uh as easy as uh can be made . uh marketing : right . industrial designer : so i yeah . you how can you make it any easier ? marketing : user interface : with two huge buttons . marketing : the power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? industrial designer : yeah , huge is a yeah . marketing : two ? alright . the uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? project manager : well , no . we did n't implement anything about that . industrial designer : d we d we do n't we do n't have uh that s user interface : well it 's easier to find than a a normal black one or something , project manager : well six then . user interface : because of the colour . but industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . six ? right . industrial designer : well we do n't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , project manager : are the functions easy to learn ? industrial designer : but um um project manager : well w i we do want we have a l f f less of an user interface : we have so few functions , so yeah . marketing : yeah , i agree . project manager : and the device r_s_i_ sensitive ? user interface : well , i should i think two , project manager : yeah . user interface : because the voice recorder is n not self learning . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : alright . two ? project manager : yeah , but just do some we we marketing : yeah project manager : i th i th i think this is too time consuming . industrial designer : are we take too much time ? project manager : uh not not towards you , marketing : yeah , i agree . project manager : but towards this all . th this is industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : we you have to put it to the customers . marketing : right , r_ r_s_i_ sensitive ? r_s_i_ sensitive ? project manager : uh well well a bit , so four . marketing : four . um user interface : industrial designer : yeah , very much . one . project manager : one . and features included also one . and one . industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . uh we still think so . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : device fancy feeling . industrial designer : and i think fancy-feeling too , project manager : yeah , cool man . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : because of the titanium back . yeah . marketing : right . project manager : are there enough technology ? yeah well also we have two . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , that 's great . project manager : is the device easy to use ? user interface : the project manager : yes we have not many buttons . industrial designer : so well maybe two project manager : two , three . user interface : two two . industrial designer : because of the voice recorder . marketing : well , with the uh three . project manager : are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? well in our covers , in our fronts . user interface : yeah . project manager : so yes , one . industrial designer : yeah . one or two . yeah . user interface : one or two , another two . marketing : nah f four i think . industrial designer : four ? marketing : if you look at this industrial designer : well , it does n't really resemble any fruit , uh that 's true . project manager : industrial designer : but but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . project manager : oh okay . okay . user interface : well three . marketing : three , alright . industrial designer : and you can also have front with uh with fruit on it . marketing : yeah , that 's true . project manager : is the material attractive ? marketing : but user interface : mm . yeah . project manager : well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . so i would say at least two . industrial designer : marketing : right . project manager : okay . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : well yeah . user interface : this is the last meeting ? project manager : yes , but we we have to design much more , user interface : yeah . marketing : the average will uh come later . project manager : because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . um industrial designer : i knew things uh were going uh too smoothly . project manager : oh . uh industrial designer : there had to be some kind of trouble along the way . user interface : yeah . project manager : yes . well , look at the costs at this point . industrial designer : my god . project manager : i had to fit it in . marketing : it has to go to twelve , right ? project manager : i twelve and a half . marketing : twelve and a half . project manager : so well what costs a lot ? the sample spea costs four . industrial designer : the what ? project manager : the sample speaker , industrial designer : the project manager : the s sensor . marketing : that 's easy . kick it out . project manager : kick it out . user interface : the what ? project manager : we have to go to twelve and a half . marketing : yeah . the speaker . project manager : the speaker costs far , by far the most . industrial designer : yeah w tha that 's uh that 's a bit an optional option . marketing : that 's some wrong info , man . project manager : it it is n't worth it . industrial designer : no . no , d th no . project manager : we could make two different versions , one with and one without . marketing : it 's uh project manager : but for this marketing : it 's just extra . kick it out . project manager : so , zero . user interface : project manager : then we go to fourteen point six . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : well the titanium i do n't want to lose actually . marketing : what more ? batteries are uh quite project manager : l_c_ three ? yeah hand dynamo ? y t come on , marketing : uh no , no no no . project manager : w a remote control has a battery . user interface : um industrial designer : n uh well we have a bit of a problem i think . user interface : well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ? industrial designer : because uh project manager : well be for the lcd uh you had said . industrial designer : the lcd screen . yeah . user interface : yeah ? ca n't we do that with a regular chip ? why not ? industrial designer : because uh that uh y project manager : well what what 's the difference between simple and regular ? industrial designer : because my information says it . project manager : what 's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? user interface : yeah . regular is normal . marketing : yeah . project manager : and simple ? industrial designer : uh well yeah i i read something about it , but user interface : simple . project manager : nothing . user interface : elementary . industrial designer : project manager : well ? industrial designer : yeah , project manager : your part . industrial designer : i i read something about it , but it was n't very clear . i d i did n't in include it in my report . project manager : what happens if we do industrial designer : single well you have to use a chip . so well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the lcd screen . project manager : how much do we win ? one . user interface : we we we why ? we have very little options furthermore , for the project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but if you have a regular chip , you ca n't have the lcd screen . user interface : uh well we have to put that in . marketing : yeah , we need to have the the lcd screen . industrial designer : that that 's a fact . uh project manager : well , we could say , well this special colour , that is n't that that is n't there , marketing : no project manager : because the the fronts they will buy it . the special colour . industrial designer : yeah , but it 's only one half . marketing : yeah , but industrial designer : uh it d it does n't marketing : no , that 's n it 's not relevant . project manager : yeah , user interface : yeah , you must change the chip uh back . project manager : then you s then you only have one half left . user interface : you must change the chip back , nils . marketing : yeah . project manager : uh yeah . industrial designer : but we d then we have to lose the lcd screen . marketing : no , then the whole concept is uh industrial designer : yeah , i know but that 's what my information says . i di i did n't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . user interface : hmm . no we oh marketing : you you can make you can make it cheaper . industrial designer : you have to use it . marketing : but if you do n't sell industrial designer : marketing : project manager : yeah . user interface : you you we have an advanced chip-on-print , industrial designer : user interface : and we have an l_c_ display . i think that 's a bit double . project manager : yeah ? no , user interface : y we do n't need both . project manager : the advanced chip is needed to have an lcd display . industrial designer : for the lcd screen . yeah . yeah . user interface : says . project manager : says , his uh that was in the second meeting , i think . industrial designer : well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? because we you have uncurved project manager : well i i did single curve to well you said s double curved , uh he , user interface : ? project manager : because uh i thought it 's a b a bit cheaper already . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : we can also make it flat . industrial designer : well marketing : no industrial designer : but what what did what do n marketing : no no no . project manager : but industrial designer : sorry , but what do they mean with the curves ? project manager : curved ? industrial designer : is th is this a curve ? project manager : yes , that 's curved . industrial designer : one curve ? yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . project manager : no , it 's one curve . industrial designer : it 's how you it 's how you look at it . user interface : one curve . project manager : one curve , simple . industrial designer : well then we have a huge problem i think . w t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . project manager : we have a big financial problem . user interface : well we make it more expensive to buy . project manager : well , then we have two dollars less profit . come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they wo n't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh user interface : industrial designer : marketing : if if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . but because we we use a brand at the front and uh i dun at the back . if you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy . industrial designer : but uh i user interface : yeah or we could replace it marketing : if you if you make it cool to have project manager : by the way , we also have this one . marketing : oh , that 's just great . project manager : oh , costs nothing . that 's nice . marketing : oh , alright . industrial designer : hey but uh i think you 'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it 's it 's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . project manager : plastic is yes , but i just got it . industrial designer : well that 's pretty uh l user interface : why why do n't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , marketing : that is pretty stupid . industrial designer : n not very practical . well user interface : uh titanium-coloured plastic ? marketing : project manager : you want to dump the titanium ? user interface : yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper . project manager : and make all plastic , then we ha then we 're there . industrial designer : but i 'm n i do n't agree . user interface : but then we we 've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . industrial designer : i think project manager : th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . user interface : ah no no . marketing : user interface : it 's not ugly looking . the looks remain the same . project manager : no , i do n't think so . user interface : well , i do think so . industrial designer : i think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the project manager : yes . and the feel , user interface : feel . project manager : and th that it is strong , and industrial designer : and also the the older people will like it because of that . and because i marketing : yeah , i agree . industrial designer : alright it 's not our target audience , but it 's it 's useful if it 's uh important for old people . project manager : we still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : but not lose the one industrial designer : i think the titanium is very important . user interface : yeah alright but then we we wo n't get there . industrial designer : yeah we have a problem , yeah . w but you can better , yeah , dump the lcd screen then . user interface : we can dump the special colour . we l we use plastic . and plastic is already in colour i think . marketing : i do n't think you should dump the lcd screen . industrial designer : well what else ? user interface : no , nothing . industrial designer : w i mean uh marketing : or you shou it 's user interface : amen . marketing : or change the titanium or dump the lcd screen . but i think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the lcd screen . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : because you have lots of functions in it too . industrial designer : yeah , well yeah . alright . user interface : yeah . project manager : why ca n't i user interface : but industrial designer : i agree with that . so we u we use uh unfortunately . um . titanium-coloured plastic . project manager : i 'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that 's trendy d these days . marketing : yeah , i agree . industrial designer : so titanium-coloured plastic for the back . project manager : i i 'll talk to the managers . user interface : no no no no . w titanium stays there . project manager : titanium , i thi i think this this is this is e really good re remote . but user interface : industrial designer : yeah this is good , marketing : osl industrial designer : but it it 's not good enough . so we have to use the ditch the titanium , i 'm afraid . project manager : ah those those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? user interface : well project manager : come on . riot . user interface : industrial designer : what do we well what do we know ? all we want is a is a fancy design but we do n't really consider the costs . so project manager : yes , yes . user interface : no because we did not know anything about it . project manager : one and a half euros . hmm ? industrial designer : yeah al alright , yeah . marketing : if you do n't have the money , you ca n't make it . industrial designer : but we have to deal with it now . so marketing : so s if you do n't have the money , you ca n't make it . so this is too expensive . industrial designer : so marketing : so we have to make it cheaper . industrial designer : titanium gone and add plastic . user interface : yeah , but then we 've got money left . marketing : right . industrial designer : and on plastic times two and then we uh are there ? project manager : well , no it 's just uh all plastic . industrial designer : no project manager : well alright . huh . industrial designer : no yeah well project manager : industrial designer : oh six . marketing : it 's just free , man . industrial designer : a lot of plastic , yeah . project manager : four . so industrial designer : no two for the to make it clear . project manager : but then we can add the special colour ? as we have money over uh left . user interface : yeah . project manager : and we still have money left . user interface : yeah . w marketing : project manager : what do we want , guys ? industrial designer : i want gold plating . project manager : industrial designer : no no um marketing : yeah right . i want chrome . user interface : well i think uh the case is double curved then . because you y have that curve industrial designer : we have we have to uh fill user interface : and you have that curve . project manager : y oh no . marketing : well , th that that is the problem . user interface : yeah well uh industrial designer : w we ha project manager : alright . industrial designer : no no no , but th that 's not f um project manager : safe . user interface : well y we have curves in all directions . industrial designer : well you can you can double curve , if you do n't have titanium . and that we dropped , project manager : so alright . user interface : industrial designer : so it it can be done . but it 's pretty funny . we we do want to reach twelve point five . but it is n't bad to to to stay at eleven . project manager : finance ?
