    "answer": "project manager : next . let 's talk about money . user interface : just tr try to guess who is a user interface designer . marketing : yeah , well . industrial designer : project manager : user interface : according to the drawings . industrial designer : yeah , you 're project manager : marketing : not me . user interface : okay . project manager : so . marketing : so . twenty five euro for a remote control . project manager : yeah , mm that 's the price we want to that 's the aim for the price for the remote control . marketing : okay . project manager : we aim to do this profit . industrial designer : user interface : on the international market . marketing : 't is big number . project manager : yeah . mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , we 're to sell two million then . project manager : marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty euros maximum . 'kay . so any of you have experience in remote controls ? industrial designer : mm yeah . marketing : uh yes , we have plenty at home . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : in fact , my daughter likes l remote controls . industrial designer : project manager : that user interface : mm . to eat ? industrial designer : marketing : to eat ? yeah , mainly , and to break . project manager : so that could be a great um application . industrial designer : project manager : remote controls children proof . mm mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . yeah . user interface : children proof . marketing : ye ye yeah . so she likes uh buttons which make click , project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah , pret project manager : marketing : so it has to click . project manager : so they have to be waterproof maybe ? marketing : it has to be uh wha baby proof project manager : 'cause they eat she ate it . industrial designer : marketing : yeah but mainly it has to be very robust project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : because even if she 's not very tall she 's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it 's uh industrial designer : yeah . project manager : industrial designer : ah . marketing : so it has to be very robust . user interface : okay , unbreakable . marketing : unbreakable , yeah . user interface : uh-huh . industrial designer : yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and uh it has to be nice looking , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : colourful , maybe project manager : colourful , yeah mm . user interface : colourful ? that 's not practical . marketing : colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control industrial designer : yeah . project manager : no , that 's a good idea . industrial designer : yeah , it 's always black or yeah . marketing : , they 're always black , yeah , project manager : mm mm-mm . marketing : but this one could be i dunno , purple or b project manager : yeah . user interface : but how gon na okay , just uh but it 's uh monochrome it 's n it 's not like industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : because you think , why not . user interface : otherwise you will never find it . marketing : one colour . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : yeah even we can change colours , no ? like the uh marketing : oh like the phones , industrial designer : like the phones and these things we c yeah . marketing : yeah , it could change colours , yeah . user interface : cool . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : at least for children like one colour and . marketing : yeah . project manager : good idea . marketing : good . industrial designer : and it should be really small and . project manager : small also ? do n't you think industrial designer : huh not so big like yeah . project manager : no uh , not too much buttons or mm . industrial designer : yeah , not too much buttons and marketing : should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so y you can decide that now it 's the remote control for the television , then it 's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator industrial designer : uh . yeah . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : marketing : whatever project manager : that 's marketing : i dunno if it 's project manager : marketing : or if we should have a targeted re remote control . project manager : okay . marketing : so colour , robustness , easy to use , size , project manager : so , i think there 's marketing : yeah , size matters , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . colour , size , sh project manager : so you you think it 's better if small than bigger . industrial designer : yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this i guess . user interface : yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . okay . marketing : project manager : no , not too small , yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , like a palm sized . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : just to hold it . project manager : okay . marketing : but uh what would be different from this , from the others ? i dunno if industrial designer : uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame . mm . s so then it depends marketing : yeah , at least the colour would be different . industrial designer : you are to mm i mean you c you can easily remove the frame . marketing : i think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they 're they never find a good button in the right place . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : for some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : so there 's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , project manager : mm . so , some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what marketing : i dunno . user interface : no screens , it 's too complex . project manager : okay . industrial designer : mm . too expensive , yeah . marketing : too expensive for twelve euro ? user interface : and n maybe not too expensive , project manager : and too expensive . user interface : well it 's not my problem , but well okay . but no screens on remote controls . marketing : mm-hmm . i thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so ma i prefer to have the off button at the top right , industrial designer : ye yeah . marketing : so i would have my own design of the remote control because it 's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , if you if you like . industrial designer : i mean it it 's like marketing : i do n't know if it makes sense , but project manager : mm-mm . industrial designer : it 's like two types no ? people are right handed or left handed so y because i am left handed i use like this , say if you 're right handed you use like this marketing : yeah , for instance , mm . user interface : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . mm mm mm . industrial designer : or so tha your switch on and off should be on project manager : so adaptable yeah something user interface : adaptable . alright , good , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : maybe , if if it 's possible , yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm user interface : so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? on off ? industrial designer : maybe i think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if i 'm left-hander i use this switch to follow the main operations . user interface : i mean if it 's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a marketing : three buttons you mean ? user interface : like three mental states , project manager : three option . user interface : yeah you know what i mean , marketing : ah . project manager : user interface : we can just make it uh industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : controlled by a brain , huh ? project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : marketing : mm-hmm , yeah , sure . project manager : maybe if it 's more , if there is a software inside industrial designer : project manager : that ask you three user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : marketing : project manager : if it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah . user interface : sh sure , sure . marketing : yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time . industrial designer : mm yeah . yeah . user interface : but for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . marketing : yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . industrial designer : mm . yeah . project manager : mm . marketing : and that 's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : user interface : you do this ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : uh no . user interface : i usually just change channels . industrial designer : marketing : because i 'm only using three or four channels but industrial designer : yeah . but they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah , you can only have one bit . project manager : yeah . i change channel like this , m uh i want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah . industrial designer : dash . marketing : and then back to the one i was before , project manager : also we can be here marketing : so there 's whichever it was . user interface : uh-huh . industrial designer : yeah you can project manager : yeah , that would be cool . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : go back button is good . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . uh uh we had that in in other countries . user interface : i once had it . industrial designer : yeah yeah , the previous button is . project manager : mm yeah . marketing : yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh , okay . user interface : history . industrial designer : oh uh . project manager : marketing : then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions , project manager : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that becomes more complex , project manager : industrial designer : marketing : but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls . industrial designer : yeah yeah , what the which channels the viewer project manager : mm-mm . marketing : yeah project manager : okay . marketing : maybe it 's a project manager : so i think we have full of idea . marketing : okay . project manager : um we 're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh i want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones , make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we do n't want . and um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . um . so um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes . marketing : so what does m_e_ means ? m_e_ the user requirements ? or that 's uh that 's for us ? user interface : market expert . project manager : mm . industrial designer : marketing yeah . marketing : uh that 's me . user interface :"
