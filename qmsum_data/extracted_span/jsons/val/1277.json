    "answer": "project manager : true , if plastic is dead cheap and if we 're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we 'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what 's most important . um i think we 've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ? user interface : well have we confirmed that we 're gon na go ahead with a uh touch screen um project manager : yeah yeah okay . um user interface : interface ? project manager : yeah i think that would be best . let 's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let 's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that 's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and i think that 's a great idea . with a touch screen for the basic functions . um and we 'll yeah tha let 's provisionally let 's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . um do we have mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . marketing : true . 'cause it would have a docking base ? project manager : mm-hmm . but then again that costs as well . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : so these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ? project manager : do they ? okay . user interface : those new ones . industrial designer : can we afford to include one of those ? marketing : can we afford that ? user interface : marketing : and will somebody buy it if we do n't ? industrial designer : project manager : well i i do n't think yeah i ca n't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we 'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . marketing : right ."
