    "answer": "phd c : um well , i i sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with andreas ' help um andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams a bigram recognizer and that 's trained on switchboard which is telephone conversations . um and thanks to don 's help wh who don took the first meeting that jane had transcribed and um you know separated used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that jane had used and uh don sampled that so so eight k um and then we ran up to i guess the first twenty minutes , up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that that 's twenty minutes or so ? um yeah because i guess there 's some , grad e : or so . phd c : and don can talk to jane about this , there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh i 'm we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier . anyway so it 's twenty minutes and i actually grad e : i was that did that did that recording have the glitch in the middle ? postdoc g : i 'm puzzled by that . i oh oh , i see . phd c : there 's there 's a postdoc g : oh there was a glitch somewhere . phd c : yeah , so that actually um grad f : was it twenty minutes in , phd c : if it was twenty minutes in then i do n't know postdoc g : i forgot about that . grad f : i thought phd a : well it was interesting , postdoc g : well , i mean , they phd a : suddenly the the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent grad e : i do n't remember when it is . postdoc g : but i was able to can transcribe phd a : but i looking at the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the it was actually recognized grad e : oh no . grad f : yeah , that might be that might be that might be my fault . grad e : oh so that was just a parsing mismatch . grad f : i 'm not phd c : no actually it was yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um grad f : yeah , i was pretty certain that it worked up until that time , postdoc g : oh . that 's not good . phd c : so that 's what we have grad e : alright . phd c : but that that will be completely gone if this synch time problem postdoc g : yeah . grad e : the the glitch phd a : so so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to postdoc g : and the only glitch grad e : yeah . postdoc g : yeah . phd c : so you guys know . professor b : s sorry i have n't seen the email , phd c : yeah . grad e : th - the postdoc g : the the well wait professor b : what was the score ? phd c : so here 's the actual copy of the email postdoc g : we should say something about the glitch . he he can say something about the glitch . phd c : um oh ok grad e : yeah . postdoc g : cuz it 's it 's it 's h it 's it 's very small phd c : so does this glitch occur at other grad e : there there there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized postdoc g : very small . yep . phd c : right . grad e : so the that that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the ssh key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing doing click sounds . professor b : so phd c : and is it only once that that happens ? grad e : but yeah it right once in the middle . phd c : there 's the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong professor b : so so un unsurprisingly adam is the golden voice , grad e : um but that should n't affect anything phd c : ok so that 's actually postdoc g : s and it professor b : you see this here ? phd c : it y it 's grad e : yeah yeah `` bah `` phd c : ok no phd a : oh , and phd c : what happens is it actually affects the script that don i mean if we know about it then i guess it could always be checked for it grad e : well the acoustic one should n't do anything . phd c : but they grad f : yeah , i do n't know exactly what affected it postdoc g : i agree . i agree . phd a : i i have grad f : but i 'll i 'll talk to you about it , phd a : yeah . grad e : but i i do remember phd c : yeah . grad f : i 'll show you the point . postdoc g : yeah . it it had no effect on my transcription , you know , i mean i i had no trouble hearing it and and having time bins grad e : i do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect xml file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect . postdoc g : but there was a oh . phd c : well , the the synch time the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should , grad f : that 's what happened . phd h : yeah . grad e : where where they were n't monotonic . grad f : there was yeah , i mean phd c : right ? there 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame . phd h : yeah . postdoc g : oh , interesting . phd c : and so then , i mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that ca n't be right grad e : oh ok so that 's phd c : so anyway it 's it 's just grad e : yeah sounds like a bug . postdoc g : yeah . phd c : that 's why we only have twenty minutes but there 's a significant amount of grad f : non - zero ? um there are like more cuz there 's a lot of zeros i tacked on just because of the way the script ran , grad e : the other one i saw was that it yeah . grad f : i mean but there were there was a point . phd c : yeah that was fine . that that was ok . grad e : the other one i saw was non non - monotonic synch times and that definitely indicra indicates a bug . phd c : well that would really be a problem , yeah . so anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting . grad f : yeah . phd c : um and what 's which grad e : so that 's very encouraging . phd c : this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition , phd h : yeah . professor b : cool . phd c : there 's no i mean the language model for switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this trent lott which phd d : trent lott . phd c : um i mean these are sort of funny ones , phd d : it 'll get those though . phd c : there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references , i mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see grad e : i and as i said i would like to look at the lattices phd a : mm - hmm . phd c : but um it 's pretty good . grad e : because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ? phd c : well so i guess we can generate grad e : sounds likes ? phd a : there are a fair number of errors that are , you know where got the plural s wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong . postdoc g : mm - hmm . grad e : yeah , and who cares ? and and there were lots of of course the `` uh uh `` - s , `` in on `` - s `` of uh `` - s . phd a : mmm , so if phd c : there 's no those are actually phd a : yeah . phd c : a lot of the errors i think are out of vocabulary , phd a : mm - hmm . phd c : so is it like pzm is three words , it 's pzm , phd a : mm - hmm . phd c : i mean there 's nothing there 's no language model for pzm or grad e : right . ri - ri right . did you say there 's no language for pzm ? phd c : no language model , i mean those grad e : do you mean so every time someone says pzm it 's an error ? maybe we should n't say pzm in these meetings . phd c : well well there 's all kinds of other stuff like jimlet and i mean um anyway there grad e : yeah , that 's right , jimlet . professor b : well , we do n't even know what that means , phd c : so but this is really encouraging because grad e : yeah , that 's right . phd c : so , i mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of of r reasonable s you know switchboard this is like h about how well we do on switchboard - two data with the switchboard - one trained mostly trained recognizer grad e : right . phd c : and switchboard - two is got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic grad e : excellent . phd c : and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that 's great . professor b : yeah . yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did had the ninety - three workshop and we were all getting like seventy percent error on switchboard . phd a : mm - hmm . phd c : oh yeah professor b : you know phd c : i mean this is really , and thanks to andreas who , i mean this is a"
