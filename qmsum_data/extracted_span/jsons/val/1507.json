    "answer": "project manager : so , uh now marketing : hi christa . project manager : it 's the hi sammy . it 's the detail design meeting , so we 're going last meeting . so um , first uh mark and rama are going to present uh the prototype . uh then uh sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . then , w we user interface : yes . marketing : yes . project manager : and then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible user interface : and chocolate ? project manager : and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . and that 's all . okay . so first , let 's uh see the prototype . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : industrial designer : uh , here we have our prototype model . project manager : okay . and you have some slides then ? user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , we have also some slides . project manager : yeah . mm . user interface : yes , and place some slides . project manager : okay . uh so in which uh user interface : uh , participant three . prototype . industrial designer : in yeah . project manager : mm okay . mm . industrial designer : five . project manager : user interface : uh , so this is our remote control . project manager : user interface : it 's a r working prototype . you can use it now by switching all these buttons . so first , i present as we came to this perfect model , project manager : user interface : and then we 'll give some technical specifications . marketing : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : that 's well , so that 's that . please , next slide . we analysed all the fruits project manager : user interface : and contacted nasa , and uh made some real good project manager : masa ? user interface : yeah . if you can see this , and the stars are showing that . and um , s society will accept that . for sure . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . s please , next slide . but we still did n't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it 's the most of the moder the m the modern material we can p select . and it 's practical . and it 's still say it 's for our needs , so please press something . and as i said , it 's perfect . project manager : okay . user interface : please press it . industrial designer : experience . explanat user interface : everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an s such a r such a device . marketing : such a nice thing . industrial designer : see this . user interface : so you can touch it with your hands . marketing : can i ? user interface : sure . yes . industrial designer : you can marketing : ho-ho . imitating flatulence ] project manager : what do you say ? marketing : it says project manager : user interface : you must say it . industrial designer : spongy . marketing : i will uh project manager : one day . marketing : i 'll buy it . user interface : yeah . marketing : if i if i need so . project manager : he marketing : hopefully my daughter will like it . user interface : okay . y and we got the answer . uh , it is , yes , of course . marketing : yes , of course . of c course . user interface : , please next slide . um , this is a prototype . you can have a look at it , and that 's all i wanted to say . now it 's technical specification by our colleague . industrial designer : so marketing : oh , there is a button missing . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : this this is really flexible . you can add your buttons . marketing : it 's in option . industrial designer : yeah . so function , mm project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . and so , we have buttons and using lcd , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the lcd , and then do on and off . then you ha you 'll have volume control . so , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . project manager : industrial designer : and we have some lcd controls . like , m switching the lcd display if you want to use lcd , or you do n't want you can just use normal button . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and we have speech recognition . here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . project manager : industrial designer : and it can also do the action . project manager : industrial designer : and location finder . and we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . you can just say , where is my remote control . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like bobby . project manager : bobby . mm-hmm . marketing : hey , babe . industrial designer : and then , it will say hi . marketing : bob . hey bob . industrial designer : yeah , hi , and then you can use it . marketing : okay , project manager : hmm . 'kay . marketing : that 's good . industrial designer : so , um our team is now fruits . mainly strawberry . so , you can have marketing : oh , these are strawberries . industrial designer : and then you can see the look lcd and all the switches . project manager : are colourful . yeah . industrial designer : material , we want to stick to titanium . we will send , we want to marketing : fruit smelling spongy titanium . i did n't know it exist , but that 's great . industrial designer : yeah , or s so , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like i shown in these phones . you can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . and you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . project manager : ho-ho . that 's for the lcd or for the titanium ? marketing : you mean we can change the colour uh of th industrial designer : for the lcd . marketing : yeah . yeah okay , for the lcd . industrial designer : with titanium it 's it is silver . marketing : tit titanium is user interface : we are still working on titanium . project manager : mm-mm . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so , r we 'll start with lcd . marketing : uh , okay . project manager : industrial designer : mm , yeah . user interface : you can ask bob . it 's tuesday . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : hey , you know you 're theme today . marketing : yeah , bob , please . tuesday colour . industrial designer : yeah . even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s marketing : okay . mm-hmm . project manager : marketing : black for sunday . industrial designer : and you can have many colours on weekends . or project manager : and w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? wh wh marketing : on the lcd ? industrial designer : ah , these are like sensors . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : marketing : of course . user interface : that 's location sensors . marketing : what do you think ? strawberry sensors . very useful . project manager : okay . strawberries . industrial designer : so , marketing : industrial designer : after this meeting we 'll propose a party for our success for project manager : ah . marketing : lounge meeting . industrial designer : so , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know . marketing : user interface : yeah , and we can just some strawberry first . um industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . mm-hmm . marketing : alright . good . user interface : oops . marketing : so , huh . interesting . in interesting . mm mm . project manager : uh industrial designer : so , any specific questions for project manager : we 'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into user interface : marketing : it makes sense . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : let 's make a party first maybe . project manager : w who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in ? industrial designer : yeah . then we can discuss we can yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left . marketing : so uh , this is project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : what a design . project manager : okay . uh , so let 's uh , marketing : it 's my turn . project manager : yeah , let 's see if uh th it 's meet the evaluation criterium . marketing : mm-hmm . let 's see if this yeah , if you meet the evaluation criterion . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : oops . marketing : industrial designer : fudge . marketing : yeah . so , evaluation please . so . you made a very nice prototype , and um , i think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that . so mm uh , next slide , please . as you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control , it 's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . to so what i propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . one meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . and seven meaning , no it does n't fulfil at all . and we 're all l going to list all the criterion . i 'm going to go to that next slide , project manager : okay . marketing : and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . and then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . so , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? industrial designer : fancy . marketing : so these are the criterion uh i 'm i thought were important . of course , this can be discussed , but let 's let 's see , so let 's vote . so we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , what 's is really marketing : what do you think , is it fancy ? industrial designer : uh , it 's really project manager : uh , i think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . marketing : it is very very fancy . or have you ever seen something like that ? project manager : oh . i am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . marketing : yeah , of course . project manager : uh what do you think ? marketing : what do you think ? user interface : feel the weight . marketing : is it the weight is later . industrial designer : yeah . oh . user interface : really . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : now we 're user interface : okay . marketing : we 're on the fanciness now . i think it 's quite fancy . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : we can give at least five or six , seven . marketing : it 's uh yeah , so no it 's it 's one . project manager : it 's in the other . industrial designer : oh , oh . so oh , okay . yeah , okay . oh , okay . so marketing : yeah , o one means it 's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . project manager : mm . marketing : so it 's one or two . project manager : two . let 's say two , yeah . industrial designer : m maybe two . marketing : what do you think ? two ? user interface : two . two . marketing : okay . so here , two . up . industrial designer : technology . marketing : then we have uh technology . industrial designer : yeah . um marketing : so , what about technology ? we have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based , industrial designer : and we have lcd . marketing : we have lcd . project manager : change colour of t industrial designer : so you change colours . marketing : change colour , i mean that 's very industrial designer : useful . project manager : yeah , i think it 's a user interface : yeah , yeah , yeah . marketing : d i think it 's a one for that , at least . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . uh industrial designer : yeah , yeah . it 's silly . marketing : at least a one , yeah . project manager : mm-mm . marketing : robustness , uh-huh . industrial designer : uh , still we need to cha marketing : so let 's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away . project manager : um marketing : do you think it makes sense that it 's going to live again ? uh , maybe not the prototype . project manager : the strawberries industrial designer : yeah , it project manager : oh . marketing : let 's try . oh my god . industrial designer : maybe strawberry . marketing : okay , we just lost one strawberry . so user interface : no . how can i say this . marketing : not at all ? industrial designer : yeah , we can easily plug it . user interface : it 's still it 's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . marketing : it is yeah . yeah . user interface : a strawberry . marketing : so it 's not so bad . project manager : mm-mm . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : i um uh i would say three . project manager : yeah . but it 's too . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it 's um robust , yeah . marketing : yeah , that does make sense , yeah ? industrial designer : useful ? marketing : useful . well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? industrial designer : yeah , marketing : so i do n't know . these buttons are uh it not clear . project manager : oh , yeah , lets me try . marketing : but you have at least uh next produce . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : what is uh next , please ? industrial designer : yeah , channel . i this is volume control and channel changes . these are the main marketing : uh , it depends on the project manager : and you can uh do di two sites ? marketing : okay . industrial designer : you project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , and you can do on lcd using these going to scrolling all the option . project manager : okay , also . industrial designer : so if you do n't want marketing : so but , for instance , because the lcd is not uh touch control , touch screen , you can not go to channel twenty five directly . industrial designer : yeah , um yeah . project manager : you can , by using the user interface : you can . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : directly . user interface : you go you project manager : you c push here the the user interface : so , the basic mode project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . so that 's simple . the basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . marketing : yeah . user interface : with two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . marketing : oh , it 's a jog dial , okay . user interface : or if you go to the site , it 's channel up channel down . industrial designer : and channel . marketing : uh-huh . okay . user interface : and if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this . marketing : yeah . user interface : you select twenty , you select five . industrial designer : you can select . marketing : okay . user interface : that 's it . industrial designer : yeah mm . marketing : it 's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? do n't you think so ? may not okay , we can go . that 's uh you 're right . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , yeah . y you need to like press two and five and yeah . marketing : that 's it 's less uh yeah . but it 's it 's nice , because people anyway do n't go there . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . yeah mm . marketing : but so what do you think for it , usefulness ? industrial designer : so , d yeah , we need to address we want marketing : seems to be useful . industrial designer : we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on lcd . so project manager : let me understand well , industrial designer : so project manager : because i 'm not sure that 's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . marketing : both . yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . up . marketing : up down or left right . yeah . project manager : yeah . and which what is that ? user interface : it 's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the lcd screen . industrial designer : this is jog wheel . marketing : that project manager : okay , okay . it 's a kind oh , okay okay . user interface : like , selecting the menus . industrial designer : yeah . um , see in lcd , like you will have blocks and you select which one . marketing : cool . project manager : oh oh okay , great . marketing : i would say then uh project manager : now it 's looks us useful . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . marketing : two or three ? project manager : yeah . marketing : two or three ? industrial designer : two , maybe . project manager : yeah . marketing : okay , two . so size and weight . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : is it the the the effective size and weight that the is it uh real size , real weight ? or because it industrial designer : yeah , it 's size al almost marketing : size is going to be that , yeah ? industrial designer : yeah , because it is marketing : uh , and and industrial designer : the weight will be bit lighter . we will s we use titanium . user interface : sure , project manager : mm-mm . user interface : without titanium alloy , it 's going to be light . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . yeah . marketing : it 's going to be lighter , project manager : user interface : of course . marketing : because this seems to be very heavy f i mean , industrial designer : heavy . yeah . marketing : for my daughter , for instance . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : not sure if uh she can use it . industrial designer : but sides uh , the sides should be okay . . yeah marketing : so , should be okay . up to three for that , project manager : mm-mm . marketing : because i 'm have n't seen the weight so i must not uh user interface : okay . okay . project manager : marketing : colour and shape . project manager : uh-oh . marketing : well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the lcd . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : but um , it 's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : the case is silver titanium , no ? marketing : it 's a it 's going to be titanium . okay , okay . project manager : yeah , it 's . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that 's nice . project manager : let 's imagine . marketing : i think it 's good . okay . project manager : and what about the strawberries on the top ? i 'm not convince . but maybe i 'm not trendy . but , uh marketing : yahoo . well y you know , it 's this uh fruit and vegetable year . industrial designer : oh . yeah , yeah . yeah . project manager : yeah , but uh uh they 're not useful . marketing : so project manager : i i mean it that 's uh industrial designer : so maybe , i think marketing : uh , i think usefulness is m as as i rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , well marketing : whether it 's fancy or not now , it we have to decide . industrial designer : yeah . um marketing : but this project manager : i would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful . marketing : if it 's uh-huh . so , that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , well then it 's bit difficult to use . not like this d we 're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . project manager : mm-hmm . but the n yeah . industrial designer : so , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . so it 's marketing : so , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh industrial designer : even project manager : no , i 'm not sure uh why industrial designer : these buttons project manager : uh if it was like this industrial designer : but it looks really not really good . project manager : i it 's n no , it 's not fancy any more . industrial designer : i mean , the f yeah . so these are kind of rubber things . even if you lose one you can just put whatever . project manager : okay . user interface : and industrial designer : even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and project manager : uh-huh . and different routes . okay , i see what user interface : moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . even if it is , you know , it 's very rounded , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it 's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay , so you you you feel like it 's something uh a protection for the remote control . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah , we 've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here , project manager : also . industrial designer : so we just yeah , so even if you do n't put , it works . but this is really fancy . project manager : okay . marketing : i suggested three . project manager : okay . marketing : because uh , everybody s does n't seem to be convince , user interface : okay . okay . marketing : although it 's quite industrial designer : yeah . marketing : you have good arguments . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but project manager : okay . marketing : and uh the last one is adaptive . this is not r maybe not as important as the other one , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ? user interface : sure , sure , just look at it . it 's full adaptable . marketing : great . project manager : wow , that 's a marketing : fully adaptable . user interface : yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know . marketing : that 's yeah . so you can fit into your palm , okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that industrial designer : you can marketing : what else can we need ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : you do you think you are gon na be able to do that with ti titanium as well ? project manager : yeah , it 's fudge titanium . you know . marketing : it 's fudge , yeah , yeah . project manager : right , yeah . and uh user interface : mm , marketing : yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . well , i if if this is if you are ready to do that , then i think it deserves a one . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . let 's go for one . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : now we have to do the average . industrial designer : three , three , six , eight , eleven . marketing : who is good in math ? user interface : it 's two point one seven . marketing : okay . two point one seven . that 's nice . two point one seven out of seven . i think we have a good good thing . project manager : yeah . marketing : well , that 's all i had to say about the evaluation . project manager : so it 's a good evaluation . marketing : so it seems to be good , yeah . project manager : yeah . mm . industrial designer : yeah mm . marketing : we have uh industrial designer : yeah , two one one seven , we have . so marketing : yeah . project manager : mm-mm . marketing : yeah . okay . thanks . project manager : okay . so now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ? marketing : industrial designer : financi marketing : ah-ha . project manager : so , i have an here . um marketing : industrial designer : energy . marketing : so so how many batteries do we need ? industrial designer : uh , we use bat one battery . marketing : one battery ? project manager : okay , so two . marketing : good . why two ? industrial designer : oh , we just need one , i guess . marketing : say no . no , ne never install . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : two batteries or one ? project manager : oh . industrial designer : no , number is one . we need only one battery . project manager : yeah yeah , marketing : only one . project manager : but the price is two . oh , number . marketing : no , no . but no , no . no , no way . project manager : sorry sorry sorry . i 'm sorry . user interface : no , uh you just industrial designer : number , number . user interface : number . yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah . oh . marketing : yeah . you never use uh excel ? project manager : no , never . user interface : how marketing : good . user interface : what what 's the limit ? project manager : h marketing : it 's twelve bucks . user interface : uh , it 's it 's okay that i do n't know , 'cause uh it 's not my field . twelve bucks . okay , marketing : twelve bucks . user interface : now mm-hmm . marketing : twelve and a half , i think . user interface : check that number also . industrial designer : so we marketing : okay . okay , electronics . industrial designer : we have sample chip . marketing : so industrial designer : uh , like simple chip , yeah . marketing : it 's a simple chip ? industrial designer : so , yeah . marketing : simple chip , okay . one . industrial designer : yeah . four buttons at least . marketing : okay . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . project manager : and for the one also . industrial designer : yeah , one to one . marketing : one or two ? one ? industrial designer : yeah , one . marketing : okay . so the case , which one uh is it in the end ? industrial designer : yeah , i think we will go for a single curve , no ? marketing : let 's do a single curve . industrial designer : oh , is user interface : it 's it 's flat . industrial designer : oh . oh , okay . marketing : it 's flat , and curved . project manager : i thought you can curve user interface : it 's flat . project manager : somebody . user interface : but it is flat , marketing : it 's curvable . user interface : you look . it 's curvable , but it 's not curved . marketing : maybe there is a supplement for that , no ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : it 's only curve ? project manager : oh see , i i think that the the price is this one . marketing : okay , let 's go . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : this okay , project manager : yeah , yeah . marketing : you d project manager : do n't chip on me . marketing : we tried , we tried . project manager : user interface : oh , okay . industrial designer : oh . titanium . marketing : so , what is it ? t titanium ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : mm , that 's expensive . project manager : mm-mm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . but she wanted u the fudge titanium . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah , well marketing : let 's stick to s titan . project manager : i think it 's five , but you do n't say . marketing : special colour ? user interface : well , n why three ? industrial designer : no , only one , no ? marketing : no because uh user interface : why three ? project manager : oh , sorry . again , i 'm see it . industrial designer : um marketing : yeah . project manager : special colour , industrial designer : interface . project manager : or it 's only on the industrial designer : yes , in lcd display . project manager : yeah , but there is no colour here . industrial designer : ok yeah , an yeah . project manager : so i put it here . industrial designer : push-button . marketing : so the lcd project manager : how many push-button ? three or two ? industrial designer : uh , two . project manager : is there the scroll-wheel , okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : one scroll wheel . marketing : it 's going to be expensive . industrial designer : one lcd displayed . project manager : okay . um that 's that 's not marketing : that 's all ? project manager : we choose this one , and not this one . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : no . oh , i think , no it 's industrial designer : yeah , it 's cheaper . marketing : uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ? project manager : or only a scroll-wheel . industrial designer : yeah . only scroll wheel . marketing : or only only scroll wheel , okay . industrial designer : yeah mm . so project manager : you try to s marketing : you are trying to make make up make us up . project manager : no , no , no . industrial designer : it 's already project manager : because how do you do to y select ? industrial designer : ah . marketing : no , but you select with the two d the other two buttons , project manager : yeah , i mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel marketing : no ? that 's true . project manager : and then you industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes . and it will activate marketing : yeah . project manager : stay longer . okay . marketing : it should stay . yeah . project manager : oops . industrial designer : um , plus , yeah , it 's price is really project manager : okay , okay . um industrial designer : special colours , yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : for buttons . industrial designer : okay . yeah , buttons and strawberries . user interface : buttons just normal . industrial designer : yeah . special form . project manager : you you have all of these , no ?

project manager : yeah . mm . marketing : uh , until we get twelve fifty . project manager : mm-hmm . mm . industrial designer : oh . project manager : so think of what we can cut uh here . marketing : well , if i look at what is the most expensive things , uh it 's the lcd industrial designer : sample speaker . marketing : and the speaker . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : apparently , we have to choose one or the other . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . yeah . user interface : well , as you may know there 's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , i mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy . so , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy project manager : but you do n't need a battery ? user interface : to make electricity . yeah , that you do n't need a battery . so , it 's something like hand dynamo robot . a real high-tech version of it . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but um marketing : so that would project manager : it 's like the hand dynamo , no ? industrial designer : maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand marketing : so , but if we select the hand dynamo it 's okay , we only industrial designer : is marketing : we we win one . user interface : okay , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that 's already that . project manager : uh it 's a it 's a beginning . marketing : okay , let 's do that . project manager : okay . user interface : why not . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : let 's do that . project manager : so one here and here . industrial designer : yeah , just remo project manager : 'kay . user interface : and i propose to so uh , about chips . advanced chip on print , right ? project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : so , put minus one there , please . project manager : mm . marketing : i 'm not sure if this is legal . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : that 's right . user interface : why not ? industrial designer : uh , no . project manager : m maybe minus uh three , no ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : no . user interface : so , was there result ? industrial designer : no , no . it 's not marketing : okay , let 's see . project manager : mm-hmm . mm . user interface : let 's have a look . industrial designer : it 's not changing , no ? it you do n't marketing : yeah , yeah , yeah , if click somewhere , you 'll see features . user interface : oops . marketing : yes , it does . project manager : so marketing : maybe put minus two , so it looks uh more reasonable . user interface : yeah . why not . marketing : yeah , anyway project manager : oh , sorry . user interface : minus . marketing : no , minus two . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : nobody will know . project manager : mm . marketing : it 's not recorded , is it ? user interface : good . marketing : okay , we 're on time . project manager : okay . marketing : good . industrial designer : so now on , we can increase our still you have two more . project manager : oh , we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want . industrial designer : maybe we can use it for our party . project manager : oh . user interface : and a battery and a battery , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : both its it 's cool . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : no , now we are exp exceeding i think . user interface : now it 's fancy , let 's add one instead of two . industrial designer : yeah , that marketing : it is it ? project manager : yeah , yeah y industrial designer : marketing : i think we 're exceeding now . industrial designer : no , but point five point three . marketing : we have to remove the industrial designer : okay . marketing : uh , it 's better . i think they are counting uh project manager : yeah . mm . it 's maximum industrial designer : is really strict ? marketing : we would prefer , project manager : and do n't have to yeah , yeah . marketing : yeah . maximum is maximum . project manager : uh industrial designer : oh yeah . marketing : so , remove one of them . yeah . okay . okay , we 're uh on target . project manager : uh , mm-mm . yeah . mm . okay . mm . so target reached . marketing : i 'm just curious to see this industrial designer : ho marketing : uh my address chip on print . project manager : it 's um english uh yeah . marketing : trick . uh , i would say it 's the russian trick , but project manager : yeah , but uh is uh english . so marketing : anyway no , industrial designer : oh . uh project manager : mm . user interface : well , i do n't know . marketing : they may have some their origins , strange origins user interface : i do n't know . i am not sure who was programming this calculator , you know .
