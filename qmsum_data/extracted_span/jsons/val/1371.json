    "answer": "mark reckless am : minister , as a parent who 's been researching childcare options , it 's obvious to me that in cardiff , and to a degree in newport and monmouthshire , costs are substantially higher than this , and i haven't been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for \u00a327 , which is implied by your rate . is n't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you 're going to need a higher rate to make it work ? is n't that already obvious ? why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future ? huw irranca-davies am : chair , my biggest fear is a parent who 's actually involved in this area already , but , having been one myself\u2014 . mark , you may be right , that 's exactly why we 're piloting it and that 's why when we pilot in cardiff and newport , we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability and the \u00a34.50 per hour rate . mark reckless am : but you 're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that i 've referred to . huw irranca-davies am : no . we will be . we are going to be . mark reckless am : when are you starting ? huw irranca-davies am : cardiff and newport\u2014september . owain lloyd : this september . mark reckless am : this september ?"
