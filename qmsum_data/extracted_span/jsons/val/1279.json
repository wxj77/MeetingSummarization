    "answer": "marketing : okay . oh i totally yeah 'cause i moved it . 's put it over here . then we do n't have to worry about it . user interface : ready for this ? project manager : all set ? cool . alright , it is powerpoint time . i 've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i 've ever done in my life before this experiment industrial designer : yeah . project manager : which is kind of fun . user interface : oh man . project manager : so uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um right so um , i finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . it means i 'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . industrial designer : oh really ? project manager : i think . industrial designer : okay . project manager : i do n't know . otherwise it 's just saying i 'm the secretary marketing : project manager : and i 'm therefore i 'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , i will open them slowly , no ? wait for it , wait for it . marketing : yeah that 's not you . project manager : no . that 's how the industrial designer : project manager : wait . user interface : project manager : this is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . so um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the industrial designer , uh or from nathan , and ron and from sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we 're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we 're operating under , what kind of risk we 'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , i_e_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you did n't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . that would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . um , and uh the uh uh the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . so . that 's sorted , back to the main meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys . industrial designer : well . uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . what 's to be said about it ? um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . this is going to be the on off button project manager : industrial designer : and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . and then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . but this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it 's all put away , um . as far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , user interface : project manager : nice . user interface : industrial designer : why not ? marketing : fair enough . user interface : industrial designer : of course , if that 's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . um . project manager : perfect . industrial designer : go ahead . user interface : no it 's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we 've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity marketing : right . industrial designer : user interface : if you will . um . right , um , marketing : appropriate , okay . user interface : of course that 's uh interchangeable industrial designer : user interface : and uh i think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued marketing : mm 'kay . user interface : but this is kind of something that can be done marketing : it is an option . user interface : um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . project manager : oh , right . industrial designer : that 's this here . project manager : marketing : ah . i see . user interface : um . so that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , project manager : user interface : um , so i think that will work well with regards to our market . um and uh let 's see , well clearly there 's gon na be some more colours and what not available . um uh do you have anything else to add to that ? industrial designer : um i worried about the materials , it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it 's very durable uh , it 's not gon na break like some types of plastic that 's dropped . um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . user interface : it 's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there 's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . project manager : industrial designer : user interface : marketing : industrial designer : fact , i dunno if you noticed , but i wrote the uh the company 's name on the telephone screen , project manager : oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok industrial designer : i thought that was kinda nice . marketing : nice . industrial designer : this was actually an apple on the inside . marketing : project manager : industrial designer : this user interface : marketing : do we need to worry about um rot factors ? project manager : user interface : um it 's encased in a new uh type of uh marketing : oh okay , there 's preservatives involved , project manager : industrial designer : yeah . user interface : polymer yeah . marketing : we do n't need to worry , industrial designer : we got a bit ahead of ourselves , user interface : it 's fine . marketing : okay . industrial designer : i know we 're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but marketing : fair enough . project manager : edible televisions , it 's a wave of the future . marketing : no but user interface : it 's pos a possible new product . marketing : it 's a couple years off at least . okay . user interface : um , but i think that 's i think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , project manager : brilliant . industrial designer : right . user interface : um i dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . um , did we come in under budget ? industrial designer : uh we did , yeah . this cost well to put this into um production , we 're looking at about what was our goal ? it was twelve fifty euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . project manager : industrial designer : um , so i was quite pleased with that . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : one thing that we did n't do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that we did n't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that 's what helped keep the cost down . project manager : brilliant . industrial designer : so even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , in a lot of ways it 's just a simple remote and um i think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . marketing : okay . user interface : mm . did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? industrial designer : and oh no , we have n't talked about that yet have we ? user interface : so uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console project manager : marketing : okay . user interface : and uh i think it 's nicely designed into the into the overall look . marketing : yeah . user interface : um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier marketing : mm 'kay . user interface : and um , i think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not . industrial designer : hmm . yeah . user interface : and uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so . marketing : right . project manager : cool . industrial designer : any questions ? project manager : no , no marketing : do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? covers ? project manager : i think that 's user interface : marketing : in play now or are those ones gon na be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? industrial designer : um , do you wan na answer this one marketing : do we know where we stand on that yet ? industrial designer : or do you want me to answer it ? user interface : well we did n't quite have enough material uh . marketing : oh i was n't expecting a prototype industrial designer : yeah , yeah . user interface : oh i see , marketing : i just did n't know if you guys had any in mind yet . user interface : right , um . industrial designer : um , well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it 'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like marketing : okay . just veneer really , user interface : right . marketing : yeah . okay . user interface : actually this bottom red ring here just unclips marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . marketing : and the whole thing project manager : user interface : so i mean there are i we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials marketing : yeah . there 's okay . user interface : which i think worked out fine . we also continued on with the ideas that f following uh apple 's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . marketing : mm 'kay . okay , very cool . industrial designer : it 's not it 's not quite a a face plate , it 's more like a pseudo-face plate because it 's simple enough marketing : okay . industrial designer : that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it 's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wan na go the other way it 's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way marketing : okay . industrial designer : if you know what i mean . marketing : yep . it 's still an option if we need it . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : very cool , nice job . project manager : right , yeah thanks guys that 's very , very good work . i like it , brilliant . um , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um i got me you 've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . um the trouble is i was just given this by finance . um , it 's a spreadsheet of the parts and i 've just tentatively put in what it 's going to look like um . i 'm just gon na clear this out real quickly , but it looks like so we 'll just if we can just itemize what 's in here , we 've got this it 's a solar cell thing right ? with a back-up battery ? industrial designer : uh we did n't really touch on that but it it 's in there , project manager : with the ba okay . um and user interface : the voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . yeah . project manager : clever , clever , well done . um so i guess that would mean we 've got a bit of a um it 's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time is n't it ? industrial designer : yeah , yeah . it 's just making use of the same space and the same materials , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay . um and the case , it 's more of a single-curved case , i guess would be that be the general industrial designer : yeah , one big curve i guess you could say . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : um and we 've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . um . push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we 've got two push button interfaces do n't we ? industrial designer : yeah , mm-hmm . project manager : um . and um a special i guess it 's uh we 've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , industrial designer : yeah , special . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : and s i guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , do n't you ? 'cause it i it is very unconventional , project manager : yeah , it 's it 's quite unique . industrial designer : i like to think of it as unconventional . project manager : i like it , yeah it 's so it looks like marketing : m come in at sixteen ? project manager : a bit over budget , um . industrial designer : oh . huh , does n't match up does it ? user interface : marketing : project manager : so what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells um or take out the back-up battery . uh industrial designer : how do you feel about that ? user interface : i mean i think that uh if we 're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so i 'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it 'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you 're gon na have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote is n't working user interface : project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : what am i gon na do ? marketing : mm k . industrial designer : people 'd be real upset . i think in the long-run it 's better to keep the battery , marketing : true . industrial designer : it 's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that 's so integral to the theme that we have . project manager : hmm . what 's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just ca n't back out of now , it would have to be seems like we 'd have to go back to square one in a way . um if we were gon na try to undo one bit we 'd probably have to undo most of it , um user interface : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : although we do n't wan na get rid of the whole environmental i mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we 're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we 're actually coming in under budget if i 've done my math correctly . user interface : i mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing marketing : i mean user interface : i mean that 's what sets us apart marketing : which , it 's user interface : right ? marketing : yeah that 's what setting us into this young market , i mean that 's where we started from , so i do n't know , and i mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . industrial designer : right . user interface : and the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , i 'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but i h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here marketing : right . yeah . industrial designer : right . user interface : and uh you know i think i think that i think that we need to come to a compromise here project manager : it 's either or . marketing : yeah . user interface : and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . industrial designer : yeah . i guess we might have to do that . marketing : i think unfortunately that 's our best option . industrial designer : it 's the only way we 're gon na get below our uh goal is n't it ? of twelve fifty . project manager : 'cause we ca n't remove the push buttons 'cause they 're industrial designer : yeah , . marketing : it kind of project manager : um and we ca n't get rid of the uh i mean removing the user interface : savings . marketing : yeah . project manager : changing the case would n't be so much of a mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials . marketing : mm-mm . project manager : um . so yeah that looks like to be the only thing . so that would be the marketing : yeah . project manager : it 's a major change but yeah . alright , so industrial designer : got ta do what you got ta do . project manager : we 're in agreement on that . marketing : unfortunately i think we are . user interface : no , i think that was a good compromise you brought forward sarah . project manager : right . moving along swiftly . um , so i guess now we just go to the project evaluation which i will allow sarah to take over . marketing : that would be me . um cord ? project manager : ah of course , sorry . marketing : no problem . project manager : whoosh . marketing : can you reach , that would be great , thank you . project manager : that 'd be great industrial designer : user interface : marketing : i did n't even do that one on purpose either , user interface : marketing : damn . okay , um , basically i was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product 's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they 're important . um so i was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? is the design what we wanted it to do ? i are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? um . basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? does it respond to voice recognition ? and overall , in general , it looks like it 's coming up to par . um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it 's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . industrial designer : really good . marketing : so i think overall we 're headed in the right direction . so . user interface : they like that spongy feel . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : yeah . it looks like it 's going over well , so user interface : and the paging function works well , that 's good to hear , marketing : we 're we 're good yeah . user interface : we worked hard on that one . project manager : brilliant . industrial designer : we did . marketing : yeah . it 's i think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we 've got is working in the range we need it for , so it 's all good . industrial designer : i am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel marketing : that 's everything from me . industrial designer : but it 's okay . user interface : marketing : yeah . yeah , it is a set-back , but industrial designer : marketing : okay , do you need the cord back ? project manager : um yeah , user interface : w we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again project manager : i was just go on . industrial designer : i know . user interface : that we 're project manager : well they do n't own tellys anyway do they ? industrial designer : true . user interface : i guess that 's true . project manager : right . so , um , this one 's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . i got this slide from the coach and i 'm not sure what it 's connected to . um so i guess we are going to discuss um our project process um marketing : industrial designer : user interface : project manager : and that is gon na go into my report . so i guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , i guess , um . industrial designer : okay . marketing : as in within the team or ? project manager : i think so yeah . industrial designer : right so it 's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or marketing : okay . project manager : i think it 's i mm-hmm , i think so . i think hope i 'm not screwing up an experiment . industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : it is now , industrial designer : user interface : marketing : you 're in charge there you go . so user interface : project manager : but i trust that she would jump in if i was so okay fair enough . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : marketing : whatever . project manager : um right , um so any thoughts ? industrial designer : are we considering these points here ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : i think they 're starting blocks yeah . project manager : what do you guys feel about the process ? marketing : um , you know i think in general , for a day 's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : considering the little amount of input we had going in . um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it 's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . user interface : we did n't use the whiteboard at all . project manager : no , no whiteboard . marketing : no , we did n't . we could now if that 'd make up for it user interface : and marketing : but really industrial designer : marketing : and i feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , does n't really matter . user interface : um , also had i not been intrigued about the pen , i do n't think i woulda used it at all , i did n't write barely anything . marketing : yeah i think i was taking notes more often than usual industrial designer : yeah , it 's true . marketing : just 'cause i liked the pen , yeah . project manager : was pretty cool tack though . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : definitely . marketing : mm . i am disappointed i did n't get a note back from my personal coach . project manager : user interface : industrial designer : as you write your personal coach . project manager : marketing : yeah , but i did n't get a response industrial designer : what if you get a response two or three months from now ? user interface : marketing : so project manager : marketing : we 'll see . project manager : industrial designer : that 'd be weird . marketing : okay that would be kinda creepy . project manager : attempts to contact coach ineffective . industrial designer : marketing : well user interface : industrial designer : marketing : what kind of coaching is that really ? what if i really needed something . project manager : industrial designer : user interface : i so n i think there was a lot of room for creativity , i do n't we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . marketing : i think so . and even then we did get a decent product turned out although it 's not everything we wanted it to be . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : with the natural look . project manager : very natural look . industrial designer : that 's very natural . marketing : organic , really . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : that 's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : marketing : and highly resourceful team mates might i add industrial designer : project manager : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : which is always a plus . project manager : yeah , i think , yeah re i thought it was like really creative actually , i mean . user interface : i think the teamwork was good as well . marketing : mm yeah , i 'm impressed . industrial designer : and to prove that we were n't wasteful we did n't waste a single bit of play-doh , we used every bit . marketing : nice . all four of those little containers . project manager : including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . industrial designer : yeah , user interface : industrial designer : i guess user interface : industrial designer : my one my one criticism is that we did n't have enough colours to work with , project manager : user interface : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we only had four , was n't enough . marketing : you could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . project manager : industrial designer : i know it could have been amazing . user interface : marketing : oh well . project manager : what did you guys think about the the the roles ? marketing : they were good . industrial designer : yeah it 's f kind of fun , it was marketing : yeah . industrial designer : i think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . marketing : true . industrial designer : at the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , project manager : marketing : do your own . industrial designer : which was kind of fun . marketing : though i did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i mean maybe it 's just me but i did n't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . project manager : that 's true , i i got this spreadsheet . marketing : nothing , i did n't even get an email , user interface : industrial designer : marketing : that was it . so , yeah , i feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . user interface : well i think that was i think that was an issue i kept finding with regard to marketing : whatever . project manager : of what to do . user interface : well no but also yeah when i was reporting about what each of us was doing i was often confused as to what you were doing marketing : mm-hmm . uh-huh , that was n't very much . industrial designer : you know user interface : um and then i also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion industrial designer : yeah . user interface : which was what the whole project was about project manager : mm , mm . marketing : hmm , very much so . user interface : but and then in the end i think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , industrial designer : yeah . that was fun . i think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the powerpoint slides already put together for you user interface : which was fine . mm-hmm . industrial designer : 'cause if we did n't have that there 's no way we could have got all that done in time . marketing : yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . very much so . project manager : cool . user interface : and i think your leadership was quite good . industrial designer : it was really good yeah . project manager : she said i i i she actually made a comment off boy you 're getting into this and i really i think it 's true i did get i i felt like i got way too into it . marketing : yeah . that 's kind of a good thing though , project manager : i felt like i slipped into it a lot . industrial designer : it 's kinda fun . marketing : you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . project manager : i dunno . user interface : an so is that the first time you 've taken on that kind of role ? project manager : the first time i 've ever done anything like yeah project project management . i usually organise crap , it 's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , user interface : project manager : you know ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : little different . project manager : but you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand industrial designer : yeah . user interface : marketing : and i knew we were all lying through our teeth , industrial designer : user interface : i had to admit , as soon as w we started i mean as soon as we got the play-doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . marketing : other than that industrial designer : marketing : i could only imagine . project manager : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : project manager : maybe in in legos you know ? be fun with legos too , user interface : possibly . project manager : like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with legos user interface : oh yeah , marketing : yeah . totally . project manager : everybody knows best spaceships ever . user interface : still have 'em . project manager : um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? industrial designer : yeah ? marketing : i think so . user interface : project manager : no i , no i dunno , i d i i dunno , industrial designer : you do n't . project manager : i do n't i i was just i marketing : though we did n't actually i mean other than minor discussion at meetings there was n't except for the actual building , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it 's true huh ? marketing : but i feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board well and this would have been six months ' worth of work , not like three hours ' worth of meetings . project manager : yeah . user interface : i think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . i mean industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that 's true . project manager : yeah . course i 'm i 'm conscious of the idea of the project manager asking if you guys feel like there 's a team you know it 's like , kind of like , like hmm . industrial designer : marketing : yeah that is kind of project manager : but yeah . interesting . it 's kind of fascinating was n't it ? i mean the whole process of industrial designer : wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? project manager : i do n't know . i i do n't know if there was a ri i th marketing : mine was the mics . i did n't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , industrial designer : yeah , that 's it marketing : i was afraid i was gon na break something actually . industrial designer : 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it 's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . marketing : yeah . project manager : mm . marketing : yeah . user interface : well i dunno what i woulda shown on that board . marketing : yeah . true , but it did n't even occur to me as an option , project manager : nor i . marketing : i mean i do n't know that i would have but i know that i consciously did n't . user interface : i mean it 's just like the paper i do n't know what i really needed the paper for . marketing : true . user interface : um , because i 've got this laptop . standard , marketing : yeah . user interface : i just used it 'cause it 's literally right in front of me . project manager : i wan na see the output files from these um , from the digital paper . marketing : yeah . well it looks really professional . project manager : i wan na see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized marketing : i know . project manager : because my handwriting is crap . industrial designer : yeah , project manager : i mean , just to see what it looks like in p_d_f_ format or something . industrial designer : that 's it . usually i would do a lot more doodling too but i did n't because user interface : marketing : i know , i felt like i needed to be professional so i did n't like draw all over my paper and stuff . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : okay , well not entirely , but still , i doodled less than i usually do . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : t i i 'm curious about what the de-briefing is gon na be like . you know , like what is the uh what exactly we 're looking for here . user interface : so is this all we need to get through ? project manager : i dunno , i 'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . marketing : i guess . industrial designer : new ideas . user interface : is it marketing : it did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? project manager : well , that 's the thing i got i in the email i got this powerpoint file but this slide was just there , marketing : that slide was like that ? project manager : mm-hmm . i did n't change this one at all . marketing : well . industrial designer : i guess we 're on the right track . project manager : yeah well . user interface : any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? project manager : w i kinda like th industrial designer : no , none . marketing : uh i think they still do their job . user interface : project manager : yeah you ca n't industrial designer : i think they 're fine actually . marketing : i am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , maybe a s a circle would be alright , different . marketing : i do n't yeah . project manager : does kinda make you wonder , i mean , how much can you do with a remote control ? it 's like inventing a new car . yeah yeah , you can marketing : it 's still got ta be technically car shaped or it wo n't fit on the road , project manager : yeah . marketing : you know ? do n't know . project manager : um .
