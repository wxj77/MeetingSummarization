    "query": "<s> what was the debate over the situation of long-term care ?",
    "answer": "the chair : we 'll now go on to mr. singh . mr. jagmeet singh ( burnaby south , ndp ) : thank you very much , mr . chair . the conditions of seniors as outlined by the military were appalling , but seniors need more than just compassionate words . they need action . will the prime minister stop hiding behind excuses and actually show leadership to fix long-term care ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , the constitution of canada is not an excuse . it lays out the divisions of powers and responsibilities , and we respect the provinces ' jurisdiction over long-term care facilities . however , from the very beginning , we have indicated our willingness to support the provinces on this very important issue . we need to make sure our seniors right across the country are properly cared for , which is why we sent in the military and why we are there to help the provinces . mr. jagmeet singh : the former federal health minister , dr. philpott , said , we need to stop using jurisdiction as an excuse to not have federal leadership . that is a former federal health minister . now , we know from the military report that staff were afraid to use vital equipment because of the cost . will the prime minister call for an end to profit in long-term care ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , over the past couple of days i 've had very good conversations with the premiers of both quebec and ontario on this important issue . i look forward to discussing issues around long-term care with all the premiers of the provinces and territories tomorrow evening as well . this is something that canadians have seen needs concerted action . we will be there to support the provinces . mr. jagmeet singh : needles were reused and expired medication was used , according to military reports . will the prime minister call for an end to profit in the care of our seniors ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , the contents of that report were deeply disturbing and troubling for all canadians . that is why we are committed to working with the provinces to fix this situation . ontarians and indeed people right across the country are deeply preoccupied by what they 've seen going on . we need to fix this , and we will do that together . mr. jagmeet singh : the military report found that cockroaches and flies were present and that food was rotten . will the prime minister call for national standards so that long-term care is governed by the same principles as the canada health act ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , our priority right now is ensuring that we are supporting the provinces in their need to make sure that all seniors are protected right across the country in all those institutions . going forward , we absolutely will need to have more conversations about how we can ensure that every senior across the country is properly supported . mr. jagmeet singh : the military report found that respecting the dignity of patients was not a priority . will the prime minister call for national standards and for long-term care to be governed by the same principles as the canada health act ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , all canadians know we need to do better by our seniors . this is something we all take very seriously , and all orders of government will work together to make sure that right now , and going forward , we improve our systems . the federal government will be there to work with the provinces on making that happen . mr. jagmeet singh : mr . chair , the prime minister has said that he 's willing to work with the provinces . i 'm saying that we need to see federal leadership . we need a commitment at the federal level that the prime minister will push for things that people need , which is to remove profit from long-term care and to establish national standards . will the prime minister go beyond working with provinces and show some leadership ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , i will always be here to stand up for canadians in all different situations . we are going to work with the provinces , fully respecting jurisdictions , to make sure that , all across the country , canadians in long-term care are supported as required and receive the services and the care they deserve . the chair : mr. singh , we have 30 seconds . ask a brief question , please . mr. jagmeet singh : thank you very much . the covid-19 crisis should not be used as an excuse to avoid presenting solutions to the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls committee , in particular by delaying action on the calls for justice . this is the same government that would not recognize it as a genocide , the same government that delayed the united nations declaration legislation and the same government that is still taking indigenous kids to court . will this government commit to core funding for indigenous services to help women and girls and ensure that the calls for justice are implemented without delay ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , we continue to work very closely with partners on the calls for justice even as we act in many areas , including better funding for shelters and for victims of domestic violence . we will continue to work with those partners , but people will understand that many of those partners are very focused right now on helping front-line workers , not on establishing the report . we will continue to work with them on the report , but the covid-19 situation has made that more difficult ."
