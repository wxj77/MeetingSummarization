    "answer": "professor d : alright . so this is i was thinking all this was worse . ok so this is all better phd b : yes , better . professor d : because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two . phd a : mm - hmm . phd b : yeah . professor d : ok . i 'm i 'm all better now . ok , go ahead . phd a : so what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . professor d : yeah . mm - hmm . phd a : uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . we j jump to ninety percent . phd b : nnn , we do n't know exactly . professor d : yeah . phd a : and and um whatever the normalization , actually . if we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . so professor d : so we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to to ninety , or something . phd a : well , ninety no , i i mean ninety it 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight . professor d : eighty - nine . phd a : well , there are minor minor differences . phd b : yeah . professor d : and then adding the msg does nothing , basically . yeah . ok . phd a : uh for italian , yeah . professor d : for this case , right ? alright . so , um so actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding msg , if you uh does not help in that case . phd a : mm - hmm . professor d : um phd a : but w yeah . professor d : the other ones , we 'd have to look at it , but and the multi - english , does uh so if we think of this in error rates , we start off with , uh eighteen percent error rate , roughly . phd a : mm - hmm . professor d : um and we uh almost , uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net . and the msg does n't however particularly affect things . and we cut off , i guess about twenty - five percent of the error . uh no , not quite that , is it . uh , two point six out of eighteen . about , um sixteen percent or something of the error , um , if we use multi - english instead of the matching condition . phd a : mm - hmm . yeah . professor d : not matching condition , but uh , the uh , italian training . phd a : mm - hmm . phd b : yeah . we select these these these tasks because it 's the more difficult . professor d : yes , good . ok ? so then you 're assuming multi - english is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gon na have matching , uh , data for the uh for the new for the other languages and so forth . um , one qu thing is that , uh i think i asked you this before , but i wan na double check . when you say `` me `` in these other tests , that 's the multi - english , phd a : that 's it 's a part it 's professor d : but it is not all of the multi - english , right ? it is some piece of part of it . phd a : or , one million frames . professor d : and the multi - english is how much ? phd b : you have here the information . phd a : it 's one million and a half . yeah . professor d : oh , so you used almost all you used two thirds of it , phd a : yeah . professor d : you think . so , it it 's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this french and spanish . phd b : yeah . professor d : i wonder why yeah . uh ."
