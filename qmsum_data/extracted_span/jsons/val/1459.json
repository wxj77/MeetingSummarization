industrial designer : big buttons , positive . project manager : positive . industrial designer : all all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you wo n't know what they 're working for . project manager : okay . what are your experiences ? user interface : uh well i think the the the goal of a remote control is that it 's it it has an influence on the tv set . and that it controls the channels and the the volume . and uh i i i think it 's positive if there 's a a led uh uh a led on the corner of the of the remote . so that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it . and that if you push the button the led uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it 's working . and uh yeah . uh project manager : so and do they always have that ? user interface : yeah , but no no no . but i my my experience is that it it it 's convenient to have that . project manager : it 's easy to you . user interface : yeah . yeah . project manager : okay . 'kay . marketing : uh at home we have a tv , a video uh recorder , a d_v_d_ player , and a satellite receiver . we have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . industrial designer : thank you . marketing : that 's not really ea easy . industrial designer : help also . thank you . marketing : so it would be nice if we have one for all . and we also had a remote control for our radio set . but um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you did n't know which one was what . and it was uh uh v not easy to use . so we n barely used it . project manager : okay so they have too much . so next . for our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . so what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? what what does it have to have ? industrial designer : the weight . not not too heavy . project manager : not too heavy . yes . industrial designer : not much buttons . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : bust-free . that when you drop it , it wo n't break . like uh some kind of rubber on it . or hard uh hard plastic . uh buttons not too small . uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . uh it between the couch and you ca n't find it . when you push a but a button on the tv , then you hear some uh some sort of bleep . user interface : project manager : like a phone . industrial designer : and then you uh , hey there there 's remote control . project manager : okay . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : user interface : yeah . industrial designer : next . project manager : that 's . user interface : yeah well that 's that are good ideas . uh yeah well the led on the corner , that that indicates that it 's working . if you push a button . um yeah . and looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . so probably plastic or something . uh project manager : okay . industrial designer : marketing : yeah i think it uh from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . or you wo n't sell it . and um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . and it should work with as many uh as possible of them . project manager : okay . this is it has to be compatible with other things . okay . industrial designer : i have one more idea . just popped up . uh it it wo n't take a lot of batteries . so you do n't wo n't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . project manager : no battery use . so more ideas ? user interface : mm no . project manager : no okay . it 's only the first ideas . so uh what are we going to do now is next meeting is in half an h hour . uh okay . next meeting , half an hour . um , what you have to do . well look on your . and next instructions you 'll get in your email . so this is the first meeting . see you later in half an hour . industrial designer : okay . thank you ."
