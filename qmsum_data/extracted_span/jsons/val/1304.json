    "answer": "angela burns am : well , following on from what you said , i 've just got two really specific technical questions , then , to ask , because you said that you look across the whole scope to make sure that they are meeting all of their correct liquidity ratios and so on . so , considering how much is invested in their estates , are you happy that each university 's estates strategy and its financing is prudent and has appropriate governing-body oversight in place ? dr david blaney : yes , so the estates strategies that institutions operate are overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution , so there is proper governance oversight . and in all of those instances , there is staff and student engagement as well in the strategic approach on estates . so , the machinery is in place\u2014 angela burns am : because it 's the big thing that drives most of university borrowing , is n't it ? dr david blaney : indeed , it is . angela burns am : so , if our universities are on a sticky wicket , we just need to know that the borrowing that they 're undertaking is absolutely prudently assessed and is appropriate . so , as long as you 're content , if i can hear you say that\u2014 [ laughter . ] dr david blaney : okay . we 're content on two fronts : one is that the governance machinery within the institutions is structured appropriately to look at that , but also that if the institutions are wanting to engage in anything other than relatively trivial borrowing , they have to get our consent as well . and what we do n't do is second-guess everything , but what we do do is make sure that the governing body , or its relevant committees , have been asking the right questions . so , there are two bits to this . angela burns am : and then\u2014sorry . bethan owen : can i just add to that , then ? angela burns am : yes , of course . bethan owen : in asking for the forecasts , we have reinforced this year the importance of universities looking at different scenarios . so , to be looking at the demographic and maybe in the past , where there 's potentially been growth in the system and universities have built that into their forecast , we have explicitly asked this year that we are provided\u2014not just the governing body\u2014with the scenario where there is no growth in the income . that 's not the core forecast , but a scenario , so that it 's quite clear how reliant the forecasts are on that growth , and if that growth does n't come through , what the contingency plans are for ensuring that all the cost commitments can be met . and we should probably just differentiate between\u2014we have a role before borrowings are entered into , but all the best forecasts in the world can never quite predict , certainly what 's happened in the last two years , probably , in universities . so , there are significant borrowings that are now committed to and the key measures we are looking at are universities ' capacity to meet their covenants and their repayments under those borrowings , because that 's essential for maintaining their liquidity . angela burns am : which actually , neatly , thank you , brings me to my last question , which is : have any universities broken those loan covenants or been close to breaking them , unable to pay their borrowings as and when they fall due ?"
