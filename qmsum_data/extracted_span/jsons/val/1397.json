    "answer": "industrial designer : i 'm proud of it . user interface : project manager : okay . this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . and again i 'll take minutes . the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you 've been working on so diligently . user interface : yeah . marketing : it does look very cool . project manager : um then industrial designer : project manager : then cat 's going to present the evaluation criteria that we 're going to be evaluating this against . user interface : project manager : then i need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it 's within the finance criteria . um and then we 'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits . um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we 've been through . so we 've got forty minutes . s marketing : and then do we get to make a remote control ? industrial designer : project manager : 'cause we missed out . user interface : marketing : yeah . industrial designer : project manager : it 's now i guess that we 're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we 've got until four fifteen . industrial designer : uh-huh . how how much do we have , forty minutes ? project manager : is that right ? user interface : yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : until about four fifteen . so yeah . industrial designer : okay , so . project manager : go for it . do you want user interface : so , you said um are are we starting with the the industrial designer : presentation . user interface : so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then i will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and industrial designer : okay . okay . so um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . project manager : user interface : marketing : you think bananas are a safe thing to use ? project manager : industrial designer : um marketing : it 's a bit um phallic . industrial designer : yeah . um project manager : user interface : well , but it 's it 's just an a approximation . project manager : dual use , perfect . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : dual use , perfect . user interface : marketing : oh , your remote control ? oh that 's just bad . project manager : does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? industrial designer : um so basically it 's the it 's the flip open thing again . project manager : sorry , sorry . user interface : industrial designer : so now we we have the okay , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so ma maarika will explain you the user interface there . and it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . and we have the user interface o in here project manager : mm-hmm . wow . industrial designer : and uh the the lcd and and the scroll are inside . um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . yeah , yeah . project manager : and it 's the whole thing 's made of rubber , is that user interface : uh yeah . industrial designer : oh yeah . yeah , it has , yeah . user interface : rubber . marketing : is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? user interface : yeah , . um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be and marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , industrial designer : yeah , user interface : so we said the back side round , yeah . industrial designer : well , but i since it 's made of rubber anyway . i i think it 's it 's uh project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : it l does look like the curvy user interface : yeah . marketing : and then the whole shape 's curvy , so i would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm . hmm . user interface : yeah . and it 's spongy as well . industrial designer : marketing : i was n't very keen on that , but yeah . project manager : user interface : so so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . industrial designer : project manager : huh . mm-hmm . user interface : so we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . project manager : yeah . user interface : so it 's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . project manager : six seven eight nine . i like that . user interface : yeah . and then , well this is on off button . it 's it 's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it 's it 's kind of user friendly . project manager : yeah . user interface : and then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . project manager : uh-huh . user interface : and and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . marketing : so where 's the volume ? project manager : yeah . user interface : the volume is is scrolling . industrial designer : it 's on the side . user interface : on the side , marketing : ah , you did get that in then , user interface : this one . yeah you just do it like this . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and and and it 's it 's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . marketing : oh okay , . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : see ? so the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen project manager : yeah . user interface : and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : you can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : cool . oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . industrial designer : uh no , we we 'd not put user interface : a mute button . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . user interface : well , we 'll have this on the screen , on the display . project manager : y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you marketing : on the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . industrial designer : uh on the lcd we r you know , the main menu will have various options . user interface : well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? project manager : but if you hold it in , marketing : yeah , but it 's a scroll and click , is n't it ? project manager : if it 's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? marketing : okay , cool . user interface : okay , yeah , okay . marketing : so that that solves the whole mute issue . user interface : yeah . and okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . project manager : no . user interface : you ca n't really see it in the interface . industrial designer : yeah , it 's hidden in there somewhere . user interface : yeah . and we do have the logo on it as well . project manager : mm-hmm , very good . user interface : so i think it project manager : and it 's with the the black and yellow you 're even in the right colours . user interface : yeah . marketing : . industrial designer : cool . user interface : yeah , i think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : we ran out of resources here , so . marketing : yeah . user interface : in the actual one . project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : industrial designer : you can have a look . user interface : so if you have questions . project manager : very good , let 's have a look . user interface : project manager : test it out . marketing : . industrial designer : project manager : user interface : project manager : uh it 's a sort of intermediate colour , i guess . marketing : yeah , oh , we hold the remote . industrial designer : marketing : oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : i hate play-do , it 's just minging . industrial designer : marketing : but yeah , uh that 's cool , cool . project manager : very good . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria marketing : okay . project manager : and then we 'll there industrial designer : yeah , see the budget . project manager : i suspect we 're gon na have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we 'll se i 'm sure we can get around them somehow . marketing : industrial designer : project manager : we 'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country industrial designer : project manager : and cut some of the prices that way . user interface : marketing : wales . industrial designer : project manager : wales , for example . marketing : mm . cool , okay . right , okay . fabulous , project manager : marketing expert . marketing : yeah . okay , cool . so what we 're gon na do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design . um so we 're gon na be using a seven point scale , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really does n't , we need to go back and start again . um , you know . basically , what i did was i went through all the like user requirements and things that we 've done and we 've worked on and like made a list of them . um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : cool , so these are what they are . oh project manager : so for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . is that right ? marketing : yes , i did have a_ , b_ , c_ , and d_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . project manager : mm dots , never mind . marketing : okay . but if you can imagine that they say a_ , b_ , c_ , and d_ , then that would be really good . industrial designer : i guess we 'll give it maximum points in everything . user interface : yeah , the yeah , it 's definitely attractive . industrial designer : project manager : yeah , i agree . user interface : oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . marketing : well , i thought we 'd um kinda said that you 'd have a little thing to stick on the tv ? project manager : yeah , just prepare one now . user interface : yeah . shall i just prepare it now ? marketing : yeah . user interface : it will be red , too . marketing : cool . okay . so , be attractive to look at . that 's this one . what do you all say ? project manager : i reckon it user interface : s seven was th the maximum , yeah ? marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : i i go for seven . industrial designer : yes . marketing : oh we 're all so proud of the . project manager : seven , yeah , it 's terribly sexy . yeah . marketing : okay , so that 'll be a seven for a_ . user interface : marketing : could oh no , you ca n't whilst that 's up there . okay um uh what i 've done on the next page is i 've set it up so we just put the marks in . project manager : ah , okay . industrial designer : okay . project manager : excellent . except we ca n't marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but we can we can marketing : but that 's alright . project manager : uh we can if we industrial designer : i can i can take note uh uh marketing : if you take a note of them , and then i 'll put them in in a minute . project manager : then yeah , i 'll take a note , it 's fine . marketing : okay , so we 're all agreeing on seven for a_ ? project manager : yeah . marketing : cool , okay . does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? industrial designer : um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , project manager : i think it does . user interface : i would think yes , yeah . marketing : yeah . i mean industrial designer : so if you 're left-handed you 're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . user interface : yeah , project manager : alright . user interface : so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . marketing : yeah . project manager : but that 's gon na be a problem , industrial designer : but then yeah . project manager : 'cause you do n't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so bu it 's it 's not a huge problem , marketing : i th i think it 's not it 's not like it 's a pen . industrial designer : because i i it is operatable . user interface : but then then i think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , project manager : yeah . user interface : so they just marketing : yeah , but i mean because it 's not like it 's a pen , you know , left-handed people ca n't normally write right-handed , user interface : yeah . marketing : but they can normally do most things right-handed , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : right . marketing : so i would say it 's not such a big issue . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , because i mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . project manager : yeah . user interface : so i if the majority are right-handed , it 's uh project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so i mean that does kind of negate the whole r_s_i_ issue . project manager : yeah . marketing : so maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , i would say ? project manager : um marketing : what do you what do you all think ? user interface : or maybe six , because it 's just one one i one among the issues , project manager : yeah , i think i think for um user interface : i mean . yeah . project manager : i mean most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , i think it 's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to um user interface : yeah . industrial designer : one more thing is that i marketing : okay . industrial designer : it might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , project manager : they industrial designer : so it opens on the side . so project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : no , yeah , but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah , i mean yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : so it wo n't be a problem , marketing : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : so you guys can decide wh whether user interface : it will be and it will be it wo n't be heavy . industrial designer : oops . marketing : i th i think the alternative is flipping from the top . industrial designer : yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah . user interface : yeah well yeah , project manager : the length is gon na be difficu user interface : but it 's it 's a bit long . it 's a little bit long . marketing : yeah um user interface : well , i mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . marketing : but you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? industrial designer : uh this this kind of uh makes it more marketing : because user interface : s uh slightly smaller . industrial designer : and two , it might interfere with the i_r_ channel . marketing : so you have to keep that side flat . user interface : yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . industrial designer : okay . marketing : so it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side 's flat , than that will work . industrial designer : right . okay . marketing : okay . um okay , so c_ . are are we admitting defeat on c_ or are we saying we 're gon na stick a locator on the tv ? industrial designer : no , we have a locator . project manager : no , we 're gon na put it like we 've got th there 's the locator dot . marketing : there 's a locator . cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , user interface : mm that you stick on tv . marketing : does n't it ? to make it beep . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : or a buzzer . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds , so yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so that 's two , so that 's seven , yeah . it 's locatable ? fabulous . d_ . industrial designer : intuitive , completely intuitive . marketing : project manager : user interface : yeah . if uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things project manager : yeah . user interface : and it 's i th i think it 's project manager : i 'd say six , 'cause the i mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you 've got it . i really like the way you have it , marketing : yeah . project manager : but it 's not the immediate thing that you 're used to . industrial designer : intuitive . marketing : yeah , and i mean d industrial designer : and uh even the scroll , it 's a it 's a new technology project manager : so industrial designer : so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni project manager : might be industrial designer : so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it 's a good technology , i mean once they get used to it . project manager : but it and it 's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , project manager : five ? marketing : but it 's different , so , do you know , i mean it 's obvious how to use it , project manager : yeah . marketing : but you might have to think about it first . so we give that one a five , you think ? industrial designer : yeah , okay . i 'm gon na give a seven in everything , so . project manager : i 'm happy with five ? user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : i 'm glad you 're accepting this . it has taken a little while , has n't it ? um intuitive but sorry , it 's really hard to write on those . industrial designer : mm . marketing : i just went a bit mad , did n't i ? project manager : marketing : um okay , cool , e_ , okay . um i would guess this comes back from this whole b_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . investigate . project manager : yep . but otherwise it 's superb . marketing : so , should we give it a six ? user interface : um uh the ergonom ergonomic design project manager : yeah . user interface : well mm i mean i d uh i dunno , i mean the the repetitive stress things , industrial designer : . user interface : but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , industrial designer : yeah . yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting . user interface : yeah ? see . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , so it 's kinda industrial designer : yeah , i i think it is ergonomic . marketing : i used to send fifty texts a day , you know , project manager : well we 've banned them from marketing : and i never got repetitive strain injury from that , project manager : industrial designer : mm yeah . marketing : so i find it quite hard to believe to be honest . industrial designer : and moreover it it has um lcd and everything , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , it 's varied . marketing : okay , so we give that a six , project manager : yeah . six ? marketing : yeah . okay , f_ . user interface : yeah , it does have yeah . industrial designer : absolutely . project manager : voice control have seven . marketing : hang on , how come it 's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? that 's just project manager : ah , that 's the second one . so you must have changed it on this one where it 's got score , but not on the previous slide . marketing : oh okay , cool . um right , so . industrial designer : so it has voice control . marketing : yes , so that 's a seven then . um , cool . industrial designer : project manager : g_ technologically innovative . industrial designer : anyway it ha yeah , user interface : technologi well industrial designer : it 's the most sophisticated remote that i ever seen . marketing : project manager : but in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . user interface : yeah . well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it 's kind of new . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , but i mean you do n't project manager : all of the components have been used in other things before . industrial designer : yeah , but they 've been brought together in a remote . user interface : but at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . marketing : they 're never been used i they 've never been using remote remote control before i do n't think . project manager : but do yeah , yeah . yeah . marketing : . project manager : what do you reckon , five , six ? marketing : yeah , what do you all think ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : well , that 's it , i mean user interface : it still has to do what i what it has to do . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , but i mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , has n't it ? project manager : marketing : so , i do n't think many peop project manager : space remote . industrial designer : marketing : that 's it , they can take it with them . user interface : project manager : put fashion in electronics . industrial designer : absolutely . user interface : yeah , is n't it fashionable ? project manager : industrial designer : the carrot banana remote . user interface : yeah , sure . project manager : user interface : it 's the maximum fashion . marketing : so , we give it seven , and we write user interface : fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : there we go . industrial designer : i think that 's a . user interface : so i think we 've done very well , but industrial designer : yeah . marketing : cool . project manager : very good . user interface : what 's the assessment ? marketing : so , we need the average here , so we got user interface : the average is about six and something . project manager : yeah , one . user interface : a little bit over six . marketing : seven industrial designer : there are how many sixes ? project manager : or a seven . industrial designer : one , two , three . marketing : so we 've got four sevens , user interface : no , wait , a little bit under six . marketing : so that 's twenty eight , industrial designer : three . user interface : no , wait . marketing : three sixes , industrial designer : and one five . marketing : eighteen . user interface : oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . project manager : fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . industrial designer : okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . forty six and five , fifty one . project manager : six point point industrial designer : fifty one divided by user interface : six point something , yeah . marketing : two three four seven eight . project manager : about six point five . user interface : six point five , yeah . project manager : close enough . marketing : okay , that 's pretty good , i think . project manager : now wait until we get to finance and then we 'll see if we can afford it . marketing : project manager : that 's all you 've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? marketing : um no , that 's it , project manager : that 's it ? marketing : yeah . project manager : alright . so , finance . and we 'll see if we can unscrew this first . industrial designer : marketing : cool , there we go . project manager : sorry , this is i 'm just um marketing : . there we go and there are the marks . project manager : beautiful . user interface : yeah . project manager : not anymore . marketing : user interface : project manager : computer no signal ? industrial designer : mm i guess it 'll have to wait for a bit . project manager : adjusting . there we go . okay , so we 've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . and now we have to calculate the production costs . so i 've got an excel spreadsheet to help us do that . can you read that ? almost . industrial designer : project manager : more or less . um i started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . no hand dynamo , right ? marketing : yeah . project manager : one simple battery . user interface : yeah . project manager : no kinetic energy , no solar . the chip , we 're going for an advanced chip on print . industrial designer : advanced , yeah . project manager : we also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . user interface : yeah , yes . project manager : case material we said rubber . user interface : rubber . project manager : i do n't know what special colour means . industrial designer : mm anything uh i think which is not more . project manager : user interface : i think something coloured , yeah , probably . so i think this is probably special co no ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it could be marketing : yeah , but rubber comes coloured , does n't it ? you know . project manager : rub rubber comes coloured , user interface : yeah . project manager : it 's i would maybe it 's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it 's different . user interface : or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , project manager : yeah , let 's leave it as zero , 'cause it 's easy . user interface : yeah yeah , okay . marketing : yeah , user interface : yeah . marketing : you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . project manager : we we 're definitely going to have to user interface : we have pushbuttons , project manager : so we 've got pushbutton , and then we 've user interface : scro we have scroll wheel as well . project manager : scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? industrial designer : no uh we we have uh yeah . user interface : s yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : and we have l_c_ display project manager : and button supplements . user interface : and yeah . industrial designer : mm no . user interface : um marketing : . no . industrial designer : we do n't have project manager : no . no ? industrial designer : we 're not using any of that . user interface : yeah , but what do we ha we have l_c_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel project manager : but the the spinning wheel 's not there . i have think maybe it 's integrated with the l_c_ display ? user interface : yeah . marketing : we 've got more than one pushbutton though , user interface : okay , let 's yeah . project manager : marketing : have n't we ? project manager : i think the pushbutton oh . marketing : 'cause then you have project manager : i do n't know if that 's one marketing : that means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total does n't it ? not counting anything , we 'd still be in budget . project manager : yeah . that seems unlikely . push what uh industrial designer : wh wh what is the limit ? uh . marketing : twelve point five . project manager : whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we user interface : we have to count all of them , or yeah . industrial designer : mm i do n't think so , no . project manager : i do n't think that makes sense . industrial designer : no it says what what is the kind of interface , marketing : well it does n't , but it uh industrial designer : if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it 's a scroll wheel so we we 've put it 's pushbutton and scroll wheel and lcd display , project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : and l_c_ display . industrial designer : so that 's that 's the three kind of interfaces that we have . project manager : yeah . yeah . so , as we can see , that 's way too expensive down here . industrial designer : wh wh what 's our criteria ? marketing : this sample sensor . project manager : our budget 's twelve point five . industrial designer : uh okay . marketing : yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that 's the most expensive thing on there . project manager : yeah , so that has implications though for the . industrial designer : uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello . marketing : yeah . project manager : for the locator . marketing : but that 's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , is n't it ? industrial designer : mm and the locator also goes away . project manager : yeah . marketing : we can afford to get rid of it . user interface : but it was very no innovative project manager : yeah . marketing : so that means no locator , does it ? user interface : innovativeness . well um yeah . marketing : i mean does project manager : what else does it need ? user interface : well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . project manager : yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , i think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . user interface : this would be yeah , yeah yeah marketing : yeah . user interface : there you record your samples your speech samples and marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , okay , so we industrial designer : a also i in the case i 'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it 's just rubber , so it 's probably a flat surface rubber . uh i mean uh um yeah . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : okay , yeah . industrial designer : um project manager : right , so we need one fifty off . marketing : see , i was gon na say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause project manager : take it down to just a scroll wheel . we could do industrial designer : so tha that mean that we can not press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the lcd ? user interface : yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . industrial designer : if in the lcd we can scroll , right ? but how do we make a selection if we d can not push the button . user interface : yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we do n't have a pushbutton uh we ca we do n't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . marketing : but that 's well you would just have to to spin it down . project manager : yeah . you can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : no w w w but ha marketing : so that 's point three . industrial designer : it 's it 's the scroll wheel and i thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . user interface : but i mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . marketing : yeah , user interface : if you marketing : i mean that would n't actually cost any more . that 's the spin wheel though , is n't it ? did n't that come with the l_c_ project manager : that 's with the l_c_ industrial designer : that comes with the lcd ? marketing : yeah . project manager : we decided , 'cause it 's not on our list . industrial designer : oh so so the the this is marketing : yeah . project manager : the scroll wheel is on the side . industrial designer : . so we 're adding costs for right , okay uh i mean i think this is good . marketing : s so we 're point three over . user interface : so project manager : we 're point three over at the moment . marketing : unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether project manager : it 's nothing n marketing : and just have pushbuttons for the volume . could b still put them on the side . but yeah . project manager : yeah , marketing : i mean the scroll wheel 's pretty cool , but project manager : i have industrial designer : instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : on the side . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : okay , yeah . project manager : rather than having three different things that people have to do . industrial designer : . user interface : okay . project manager : there we go . oh look , we 're way under budget and we 'll make huge profits and we 'll all get bonuses . marketing : yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , could n't we ? industrial designer : project manager : or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . marketing : yeah , but project manager : so that 's alright . we we 'll leave it at that marketing : yeah . project manager : and then i 'll take i can send it back to management and say we were n't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we 've still got some space for it , industrial designer : we have , yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : excellent . alright . so did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? industrial designer : not really , no . marketing : no , i do n't think so . industrial designer : because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep lcd display . we instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : we just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , industrial designer : um yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : and the scroll wheel is i mean essentially the two buttons that was it 's not a great difference i do n't think . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but we lose the locator . project manager : alright then . marketing : really ? project manager : we 're gon na have a beep . user interface : well we 're going to have a beeping thing . industrial designer : so instead of speaker , . project manager : yeah . user interface : but yeah , it 's it 's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : cool . that 's not a very exciting colour . i think you should make it more vegetable-like . industrial designer : project manager : tha user interface : which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the industrial designer : marketing : oh the the beeper thing . project manager : . marketing : it user interface : but it can be yellow as well . it can come in the same colour as the the case . project manager : 'cause we we wo n't have run out of our pot of play-doh . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , i think jen wants it to vibrate . industrial designer : project manager : yeah , i know i know , my pen vibrates . user interface : marketing : you know , your pen vibrates ?

ideas ? user interface : yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah i think there was there was room for creativity . the only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : i think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um we kap kept a adding things randomly . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so , had we known project manager : yeah . marketing : if we 'd had that sheet at the beginning should 've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let 's just throw it together and do what we can . industrial designer : yeah , that or not , yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . so d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : mm . project manager : but in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . industrial designer : yeah , mm . marketing : i think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . it was n't like we were alone for very long , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so you did n't st go off and think , would n't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : banana . industrial designer : marketing : and then , you know , come back three days later and jen 's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . industrial designer : project manager : user interface : yeah . marketing : um yeah , so yeah . user interface : yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . project manager : mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens . user interface : and the pens . marketing : uh i like the pens . project manager : we like the pens . marketing : i want one . that would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s project manager : yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah , project manager : and have it printed out when you got back to the office . user interface : yeah , yeah . industrial designer : that 's it 's it 's project manager : they great ?

industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the marketing : yeah . the thing flew in , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : you did n't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there was n't time for that , so yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . that 's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah . marketing : not that you can do that on the board , either . we could make some little user interface : but yeah , but i mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . marketing : yeah , totally , i mean that was fairly tight anyway , i mean especially with that last-minute alteration . project manager : mm . yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : mm yeah . marketing : back it , this is just had to be changed user interface : marketing : . and yeah , so cool . project manager : yeah . marketing : are we supposed to say nice things about jen now ?
