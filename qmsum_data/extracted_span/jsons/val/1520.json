    "query": "<s> what was the questioning about the reports on long-term care facilities ?",
    "answer": "mr. james bezan : thank you , chair . my question is to the prime minister . he was just talking about the tragic conditions in long-term care facilities in ontario , and there was a report out from quebec today . i want to commend the canadian armed forces for witnessing these appalling conditions , putting it in the context of a report , and providing care to our loved ones in these long-term care facilities . the government is saying they did n't receive the report from the department until may 22 , but this report came out on may 14 . what happened to that report for eight days ? the chair : we will go to the honourable minister . we seem to have a technical issue , mr. sajjan . we ca n't hear you . you might want to put down your bar and keep it down while you 're speaking . hon . harjit s. sajjan ( minister of national defence ) : mr . chair , i want to thank our canadian armed forces members for the tremendous work they are doing . they did their duty , noted down their observations and reported them . while those observations were being reported directly to the managers , a report was being compiled . this report was given to me on the 21st . i then forwarded it to the minister of public safety on the 22nd , and that report was then given to the provincial authorities very quickly afterwards . mr. james bezan : i trust that you got the report on the 21st , but the report was written on the 14th , so what happened with that report for seven days ? why was n't it acted upon ? could you just explain that ? our loved ones were at risk during that entire time . hon . harjit s. sajjan : mr . chair , as we stated , this report was done and given up through the chain of command , and the appropriate leadership did their due diligence . once we received this report , it was forwarded to the appropriate authorities . again , i want to commend our canadian armed forces members for not only the tremendous work they are doing but also for doing their duty . mr. james bezan : that report from ontario documented appalling conditions , horrific care that was being given to the clients , and also the way that the staff conducted themselves . we know that there are 39 members of the canadian armed forces currently infected with covid-19 . minister , do you believe that the infection could have been transmitted from staff to our soldiers serving in long-term care facilities because proper protocols were not being followed ? hon . harjit s. sajjan : mr . chair , when it comes to any type of activities that we send our canadian armed forces on , we do our due diligence to make sure that we have the right protocols in place and the appropriate training . this is why we have taken the time to make sure our folks not only did the appropriate training but had the appropriate equipment . we have the right protocols in place , and we will make sure that our members who are infected by covid will get the appropriate treatment as well . mr. james bezan : does the minister of national defence believe that our soldiers serving in operation laser , who have put themselves in harm 's way in battling the covid virus as a war , deserve to have hazard pay benefits ? hon . harjit s. sajjan : mr . chair , when it comes to looking after canadian armed forces personnel , yes , we are actually in the process as we speak of making sure that our members have the appropriate hazard pay . this is currently being drafted , and we will have more to say on this shortly . mr. james bezan : i hope that means it 's a yes . i do encourage the government to provide that compensation to our soldiers and troops serving in operation laser . i would finally like to come back to the issue of the timeline from may 14 to may 21 , when that report was in the department for one week . under our parliamentary system , ministers are accountable for the conduct of their departments . will the minister take responsibility for that report sitting on someone 's desk for seven days and not being turned over to the proper authorities ? hon . harjit s. sajjan : mr . chair , i want to make it very clear : when it comes to the observations that were made , those were immediately reported to the appropriate management of the care facilities and to the appropriate links within the province . at the same time , this report was being compiled and pushed up to the chain of command , and they did their due diligence . as i stated , it was given to us , and on the same day it was forwarded to the minister of public safety , who immediately then sent it to the provincial authorities . mr. james bezan : was one of those authorities that this was sent to the rcmp ? hon . harjit s. sajjan : mr . chair , as stated , this will not only be given to the proper authorities but the appropriate steps will be taken now ."
