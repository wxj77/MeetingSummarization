    "answer": "project manager : alright . so , finance . and we 'll see if we can unscrew this first . industrial designer : marketing : cool , there we go . project manager : sorry , this is i 'm just um marketing : . there we go and there are the marks . project manager : beautiful . user interface : yeah . project manager : not anymore . marketing : user interface : project manager : computer no signal ? industrial designer : mm i guess it 'll have to wait for a bit . project manager : adjusting . there we go . okay , so we 've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . and now we have to calculate the production costs . so i 've got an excel spreadsheet to help us do that . can you read that ? almost . industrial designer : project manager : more or less . um i started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . no hand dynamo , right ? marketing : yeah . project manager : one simple battery . user interface : yeah . project manager : no kinetic energy , no solar . the chip , we 're going for an advanced chip on print . industrial designer : advanced , yeah . project manager : we also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . user interface : yeah , yes . project manager : case material we said rubber . user interface : rubber . project manager : i do n't know what special colour means . industrial designer : mm anything uh i think which is not more . project manager : user interface : i think something coloured , yeah , probably . so i think this is probably special co no ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it could be marketing : yeah , but rubber comes coloured , does n't it ? you know . project manager : rub rubber comes coloured , user interface : yeah . project manager : it 's i would maybe it 's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it 's different . user interface : or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , project manager : yeah , let 's leave it as zero , 'cause it 's easy . user interface : yeah yeah , okay . marketing : yeah , user interface : yeah . marketing : you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . project manager : we we 're definitely going to have to user interface : we have pushbuttons , project manager : so we 've got pushbutton , and then we 've user interface : scro we have scroll wheel as well . project manager : scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? industrial designer : no uh we we have uh yeah . user interface : s yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : and we have l_c_ display project manager : and button supplements . user interface : and yeah . industrial designer : mm no . user interface : um marketing : . no . industrial designer : we do n't have project manager : no . no ? industrial designer : we 're not using any of that . user interface : yeah , but what do we ha we have l_c_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel project manager : but the the spinning wheel 's not there . i have think maybe it 's integrated with the l_c_ display ? user interface : yeah . marketing : we 've got more than one pushbutton though , user interface : okay , let 's yeah . project manager : marketing : have n't we ? project manager : i think the pushbutton oh . marketing : 'cause then you have project manager : i do n't know if that 's one marketing : that means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total does n't it ? not counting anything , we 'd still be in budget . project manager : yeah . that seems unlikely . push what uh industrial designer : wh wh what is the limit ? uh . marketing : twelve point five . project manager : whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we user interface : we have to count all of them , or yeah . industrial designer : mm i do n't think so , no . project manager : i do n't think that makes sense . industrial designer : no it says what what is the kind of interface , marketing : well it does n't , but it uh industrial designer : if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it 's a scroll wheel so we we 've put it 's pushbutton and scroll wheel and lcd display , project manager : yeah . yeah . marketing : and l_c_ display . industrial designer : so that 's that 's the three kind of interfaces that we have . project manager : yeah . yeah . so , as we can see , that 's way too expensive down here . industrial designer : wh wh what 's our criteria ? marketing : this sample sensor . project manager : our budget 's twelve point five . industrial designer : uh okay . marketing : yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that 's the most expensive thing on there . project manager : yeah , so that has implications though for the . industrial designer : uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello . marketing : yeah . project manager : for the locator . marketing : but that 's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , is n't it ? industrial designer : mm and the locator also goes away . project manager : yeah . marketing : we can afford to get rid of it . user interface : but it was very no innovative project manager : yeah . marketing : so that means no locator , does it ? user interface : innovativeness . well um yeah . marketing : i mean does project manager : what else does it need ? user interface : well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . project manager : yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , i think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . user interface : this would be yeah , yeah yeah marketing : yeah . user interface : there you record your samples your speech samples and marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah , okay , so we industrial designer : a also i in the case i 'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it 's just rubber , so it 's probably a flat surface rubber . uh i mean uh um yeah . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : okay , yeah . industrial designer : um project manager : right , so we need one fifty off . marketing : see , i was gon na say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause project manager : take it down to just a scroll wheel . we could do industrial designer : so tha that mean that we can not press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the lcd ? user interface : yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . industrial designer : if in the lcd we can scroll , right ? but how do we make a selection if we d can not push the button . user interface : yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we do n't have a pushbutton uh we ca we do n't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . marketing : but that 's well you would just have to to spin it down . project manager : yeah . you can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : no w w w but ha marketing : so that 's point three . industrial designer : it 's it 's the scroll wheel and i thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . user interface : but i mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . marketing : yeah , user interface : if you marketing : i mean that would n't actually cost any more . that 's the spin wheel though , is n't it ? did n't that come with the l_c_ project manager : that 's with the l_c_ industrial designer : that comes with the lcd ? marketing : yeah . project manager : we decided , 'cause it 's not on our list . industrial designer : oh so so the the this is marketing : yeah . project manager : the scroll wheel is on the side . industrial designer : . so we 're adding costs for right , okay uh i mean i think this is good . marketing : s so we 're point three over . user interface : so project manager : we 're point three over at the moment . marketing : unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether project manager : it 's nothing n marketing : and just have pushbuttons for the volume . could b still put them on the side . but yeah . project manager : yeah , marketing : i mean the scroll wheel 's pretty cool , but project manager : i have industrial designer : instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : on the side . marketing : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : okay , yeah . project manager : rather than having three different things that people have to do . industrial designer : . user interface : okay . project manager : there we go . oh look , we 're way under budget and we 'll make huge profits and we 'll all get bonuses . marketing : yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , could n't we ? industrial designer : project manager : or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . marketing : yeah , but project manager : so that 's alright . we we 'll leave it at that marketing : yeah . project manager : and then i 'll take i can send it back to management and say we were n't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we 've still got some space for it , industrial designer : we have , yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : excellent . alright . so did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? industrial designer : not really , no . marketing : no , i do n't think so . industrial designer : because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep lcd display . we instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : we just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , industrial designer : um yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : and the scroll wheel is i mean essentially the two buttons that was it 's not a great difference i do n't think . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but we lose the locator . project manager : alright then . marketing : really ? project manager : we 're gon na have a beep . user interface : well we 're going to have a beeping thing . industrial designer : so instead of speaker , . project manager : yeah . user interface : but yeah , it 's it 's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : 'kay . marketing : cool . that 's not a very exciting colour . i think you should make it more vegetable-like . industrial designer : project manager : tha user interface : which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the industrial designer : marketing : oh the the beeper thing . project manager : . marketing : it user interface : but it can be yellow as well . it can come in the same colour as the the case . project manager : 'cause we we wo n't have run out of our pot of play-doh . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , i think jen wants it to vibrate . industrial designer : project manager : yeah , i know i know , my pen vibrates . user interface : marketing : you know , your pen vibrates ? industrial designer : marketing : yeah . project manager : but only for a very short time . um okay . so looks like we 've designed a banana . industrial designer : marketing : user interface : project manager : well done , team . um we need we 've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they 're designing a product . industrial designer : i think it mm marketing : cool . project manager : feedback ? ideas ? user interface : yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah i think there was there was room for creativity . the only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : i think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : um we kap kept a adding things randomly . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : so , had we known project manager : yeah . marketing : if we 'd had that sheet at the beginning should 've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let 's just throw it together and do what we can . industrial designer : yeah , that or not , yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . so d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . marketing : yeah ."
