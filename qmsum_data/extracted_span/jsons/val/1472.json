    "answer": "grad e : i guess . grad a : ok , we 're on . so just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless . grad e : check one . check one . grad a : and you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change . grad b : so , which is my bar ? mah ! number one . grad e : sibilance . sibilance . grad a : so , actually , if you guys wan na go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright . grad e : are we supposed to read digits at the same time ? grad a : no . no . grad e : oh , ok . grad a : each individually . we 're talking about doing all at the same time but i think cognitively that would be really difficult . to try to read them while everyone else is . grad e : everyone would need extreme focus . grad a : so , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on . professor c : other way . we m we may wind up with ver we we may need versions of all this garbage . grad b : for our stuff . yeah . professor c : yeah . grad a : um . so the first thing you 'd wan na do is just say which transcript you 're on . professor c : yeah . grad a : so . you can see the transcript ? there 's two large number strings on the digits ? so you would just read that one . and then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . and the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . and i 'll give i 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . um . again , i 'm not sure how much i should talk about stuff before everyone 's here . professor c : mmm . well , we have one more coming . grad a : ok . well , why do n't i go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there . professor c : ok . well , we can start doing it . grad a : thanks . so , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . all of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . and that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you do n't breathe into the mike . um . yeah , that 's good . and uh so , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . and the short form i mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . so , if you say things and you do n't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you do n't like . um . on the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . if you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . so , do n't worry too much about it . the it 's just self rating . um . and i think that 's about it . i mean , should i do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ? professor c : um , yeah . grad a : or ? professor c : no . there was there was let 's see . oh grad e : does nancy know that we 're meeting in here ? grad b : i sent an email . professor c : she got an emai she was notified . grad e : oh yeah , she got an e yeah , yeah . professor c : whether she knows is another question . um . so are the people going to be identified by name ? grad a : well , what we 're gon na we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . um , but not in the audio . professor c : right . grad a : so the professor c : ok . so , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . since it it does is n't attributed . oh , i see , but the a but the but the grad a : right , so if i said , `` oh , hi jerry , how are you ? `` , we 're not gon na go through and cancel out the `` jerry `` s . professor c : yeah . sure . grad a : um , so we will go through and , in the speaker id tags there 'll be , you know , m - one o seven , m - one o eight . professor c : right . grad a : um , but uh , professor c : right . grad a : um , it w uh , i do n't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data . professor c : ok . mm - hmm . no , i i was n't complaining , i just wanted to understand . grad a : right . grad b : well , we can make up aliases for each of us . grad a : yeah , i mean , whatever you wan na do is fine , professor c : right . grad a : but we find that we want the meeting to be as natural as possible . so , we 're trying to do real meetings . and so we do n't wan na have to do aliases professor c : right . grad a : and we do n't want people to be editing what they say . grad b : right . grad a : so i think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash microsoft . professor c : right . grad b : mm - hmm . grad a : you know ? professor c : right . um , ok . so why do n't you tell us briefly grad a : ok . so th professor c : your give give your e normal schpiel . grad a : um . so this is the project is called meeting recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . um . so my particular interest is in the pda of the future . this is a mock - up of one . yes , we do believe the pda of the future will be made of wood . um . { comment } the idea is that you 'd be able to put a pda at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . so that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . um . so the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . and so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . what the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who are n't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . so , for people who are more interested in language , we did n't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . and then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . um . and so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . so we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . so that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . and then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the ldc . and , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . um . there 's other work going on in meeting recording . so , we 're we 're working with sri , with uw , um . nist has started an effort which will include video . we 're not including video , obviously . and uh and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from ibm . is also involved . um . oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . um . so because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . and it 's exactly the same digit strings as in ti - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus . so we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made . anything else ? ok , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . it should be on already . um . either one of those . and uh , read the digit strings and and fill out the forms . so , the most important form is the consent form , so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent . grad b : i 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late , grad a : yeah . grad b : so you will have to leave what you set . grad a : right . and uh , just give me a call , which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over . and i 'm going to leave the mike here but it 's n uh , but i 'm not gon na be on so do n't have them use this one . it 'll just be sitting here . grad b : input ? yeah . there we go . professor c : by the way , adam , we will be using the , uh , screen as well . so , you know . wow ! organization . so you guys who got email about this oh f uh , friday or something about what we 're up to . grad b : i got it . grad e : what was the nature of the email ? professor c : oh , this was about um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words , like `` s go to see `` , or `` visit `` , or some grad b : wel - we i uh i i professor c : you did n't get it ? grad e : i do n't think i did . professor c : i guess these g have got better filters . cuz i sent it to everybody . you just blew it off . grad b : it 's really simple though . so this is the idea . um . we could pursue , um , if we thought it 's it 's worth it but , uh , i think we we will agree on that , um , to come up with a with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , and do some implementation work , and do some some research , and some modeling . so the idea is if you want to go somewhere , um , and focus on that object down oh , i can actually walk with this . this is nice . down here . that 's the powder - tower . now , um , we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do . um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it . and touch it . but you can not enter or do anything else . unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it wo n't do you no good standing there . it 's just a dark alley . but you can touch it . if you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . if you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , { comment } you have to go this way , and go up here . and there you have a vre really view it exploded , the during the thirty years - war . really uh , interesting sight . and um , these uh these lines are , um , paths , or so that 's ab er , i the street network of our geographic information system . and you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part . because otherwise we could n't get our gis system to take to lead people this way . it would always use the closest point to the object , and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall , but it would do them absolutely no good . so , what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . maybe you want to enter a building . maybe you want to see it , take a picture of it . or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . for whatever reason that may be . grad e : what 's it what 's it made out of ? grad b : um , r red limestone . grad e : so maybe you would wan na touch it . grad b : yeah , maybe you would want to touch it . um . okay , i this , um these intentions , we w w we could , if we want to , call it the the vista mode , where we just want to eh s get the overview or look at it , the enter mode , and the , well , tango mode . i always come up with with silly names . so this `` tango `` means , literally translated , `` to touch `` . so but sometimes the the tango mode is really relevant in the in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh if you do n't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . consider , for example , the post office in chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code . so the entrance could be miles away from the closest point . so sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there . so , um , i 've looked , uh , through twenty some uh , i did n't look through all the data . um , and there there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people uh , the ways people phrase how to g get if they want to get to a certain place . and sometimes here it 's b it 's a little bit more obvious um . maybe i should go back a couple of steps and go through the professor c : no , ok come in , sit down . if you grab yourself a microphone . grad b : you need to sign some stuff and read some digits . professor c : well , you can sign afterwards . grad b : o or later . grad e : you have to al also have to read some digits . professor c : afterwards . grad d : ok . { comment } ok . afterwards is fine . grad b : they are uncomfortable . mm - hmm . grad d : really small ? ok . i see . ok . thank you . grad b : ok , but that was our idea . professor c : and it it it it it also has to be switched on , nance . grad b : is i i think grad e : no , that one 's already on , i thought he said . professor c : it 's on ? ok , good . grad d : ok . it 's on . grad e : yeah . grad b : ok . that was the idea . um , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it . sometimes they want to enter it . and sometimes they want to get really close to it . that 's something we found . it 's just a truism . and the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different . i i gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where if you want to enter it . so , this is sort of how people may , uh may phrase those requests to a a a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . and we get tons of of these `` how do i get to `` , `` i want to go to `` , but also , `` give me directions to `` , and `` i would like to see `` . and um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the the data that was the wrong one . um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . first of all , very important , and um , that i 've completely forgot that when we talked . this is of course a crucial factor , `` what type of object is it ? `` so , some buildings you just do n't want to take pictures of . or very rarely . but you usually want to enter them . some objects are more picturesque , and you more f more highly photographed . then of course the the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . um . sometimes i found in the uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , i found some s sort of modifiers that that m may also give us a hint , um , `` i 'm trying to get to `` nuh ? `` i need to get to `` . sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . and this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . that whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of of a phrase . so , this is , uh , really uh , uh , uh my suggestion is really simple . we start with , um now , let me , uh , say one more thing . what we do know , is that the parser we use in the smartkom system will never differentiate between any of these . so , basically all of these things will result in the same xml m - three - l structure . sort of action `` go `` , and then an object . grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : yeah ? and a source . so it 's it 's it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . so , i thought , `` mmm ! maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . `` where we can start it and n sort of look `` ok , we need , we gon na get those m - three - l structures . the crude , undifferentiated parse . interpreted input . we may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries . we 'll see . and i will try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . so this is not something which we can actually monitor , now , but just is something we can set . and then you can all imagine sort of a a constrained satisfaction program , depending on on what , um , comes out . we want to have an a structure resulting if we feed it through a belief - net or or something along those lines . we 'd get an inferred intention , we we produce a structure that differentiates between the vista , the enter , and the , um , tango mode . which i think we maybe want to ignore . but . that 's my idea . it 's up for discussion . we can change all of it , any bit of it . throw it all away . grad f : now @ @ this email that you sent , actually . professor c : what ? grad f : now i remember the email . grad e : huh . still , i have no recollection whatsoever of the email . i 'll have to go back and check . professor c : not important . so , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is . and , the the i uh , robert and i talked about this some on friday . and we think it 's well - formed . so we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain . grad f : so , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ? like i mean , s is it before the bayes - net ? is it , uh professor c : well , it 's the it 's it 's always all of it . so , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere . uh , so the notion is that , uh , this is n't real deep . but it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . and , so that 's that 's the quote `` deep `` that we 're trying to get at . and , robert 's point is that the current front - end does n't give you any way to not only does n't it do it , but it also does n't give you enough information to do it . it is n't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on . so , uh , and this is bu - i in general it 's gon na be true of any kind of deep understanding , there 's gon na be contextual things , there 're gon na be linguistic things , there 're gon na be discourse things , and they got ta be combined . and , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gon na work better . um , the idea would be that you , uh , take your you 're editing your slide ? grad b : yeah . as i a sort of , as i get ideas , uh w uh . so , discourse i i i thought about that . of course that needs to sort of go in there . professor c : oh . i 'm sorry . ok . so . this is minutes taking minutes as we go , in his in his own way . um , but the p the anyway . so the thing is , i uh , d naively speaking , you 've you 've got a for this little task , a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , that the person wants to uh , to view it , to enter it , or to tango with it . um . so that the the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed . and , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things . and , then the question is there are two questions is , uh , one , where do you get this i { comment } information from , and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? so what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? and you probably need intermediate nodes . i we do n't know what they are yet . so it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether oh , another thing you want is some information abou i think , about the time of day . now , they may wan na call that part of context . grad b : mm - hmm . professor c : but the time of day matters a lot . and , if things are obviously closed , then , you grad b : people wo n't want to enter it . professor c : pe - people do n't wan na enter them . and , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they do n't have the option of entering it . so another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a more of a dialogue . so if someone says something you could ask them . grad e : yeah . professor c : ok . and now , one thing you could do is always ask them , but that 's boring . and it also w it also be a pain for the person using it . so one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , `` whenever you got a question like that i 've got one of three answers . ask them which one you want . `` ok . but that 's , um , not what we 're gon na do . grad b : but maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call . professor c : oh yeah . you want the you want the ability to a you want the ability to ask , but what you do n't wan na do is onl build a system that always asks every time , and i that 's not getting at the scientific problem , grad b : mm - hmm . professor c : and it 's in general you 're you know , it 's gon na be much more complex than that . a this is purposely a really simple case . grad b : yeah . professor c : so , uh yeah . grad b : i have one more point to to bhaskara 's question . um , i think also the the the deep understanding part of it is is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling . we can start , you know , basic from human beings , model that , its motions , going , walking , seeing , we can mem model all of that and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives . that will be extremely deep in the in in in my understanding . professor c : yeah . s so so the way that might come up , if you wan na suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , `` um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a source - path - goal schema involved ? `` ok ? and if so , uh , is there a focus on the goal ? or is there a focus on the path ? or something . and that could be , uh , one of the conditiona you know , th the in some piece of the belief - net , that could be the the appropriate thing to enter . grad f : so , where would we extract that information from ? from the m - three - l ? professor c : no . no . see , the m - three - l is not gon na give th what he was saying is , the m - three - l does not have any of that . all it has is some really crude stuff saying , `` a person wants to go to a place . `` grad f : right . grad e : the m - three - l is the old smartkom output ? professor c : right . m - three well , m - three - l itself refers to multimedia mark - up language . grad e : ok . it 's just a language . right , yeah . professor c : so we have th w we we we have to have a better w way of referring to grad b : the parser output ? professor c : mm - hmm . grad b : `` analyzed speech `` i think it 's what they call it , professor c : yeah . the well , ok . grad b : really , oder professor c : yeah . grad b : o th no , actually , intention lattices is what we 're gon na get . professor c : is - i but they c they call it intention lattice , but tha grad b : in - in a intention lattice k hypothesis . professor c : anyway . grad b : they call it intention hypotheses . professor c : right . so , th they 're gon na give us some cr uh or we can assume that y you get this crude information . about intention , and that 's all they 're going to provide . and they do n't give you the kind of object , they do n't give you any discourse history , if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else . grad b : well , they keep it . we have to request it . professor c : right . grad b : nuh ? but it 's not in there . professor c : well , they they kee they keep it by their lights . it may it may or may not be what what we want . grad b : yeah , or i professor c : yeah . grad e : so , if someone says , `` i wan na touch the side of the powder - tower `` , that would basically , we need to pop up tango mode and the and the directions ? professor c : if i if yeah , if it got as simple as that , yeah . grad e : yeah . professor c : but it would n't . grad e : ok . but that does n't necessarily but we 'd have to infer a source - path - goal to some degree for touching the side , right ? grad b : well uh , th the there is a p a point there if i understand you . correct ? um , because um , sometimes people just say things this you find very often . `` where is the city hall ? `` and this do they do n't wan na sh see it on a map , or they do n't wan na know it 's five hundred yards away from you , or that it 's to the your north . they wan na go there . that 's what they say , is , `` where is it ? `` . where is that damn thing ? grad e : and the parser would output grad b : well , that 's a a question mark . sh a lot of parsers , um , just , uh that 's way beyond their scope , is of interpreting that . you know ? but um , still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure , with the town hall and maybe saying it 's a wh focus on the town hall . but to interpret it , grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : you know ? somebody else has to do that job later . professor c : yeah . grad e : i 'm just trying to figure out what the smartkom system would output , depending on these things . grad b : um , it will probably tell you how far away it is , at least that 's that 's even what deep map does . it tells you how far away it is , and and shows it to you on a map . because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where where it is . grad d : people no might not be able to infer that either , right ? like the fact like , i could imagine if someone came up to me and asked , `` where 's the city hall ? `` , i might say , g ar `` are you trying to get there ? `` because how i describe um , t its location uh , p probably depend on whether i think i should give them , you know , directions now , or say , you know , whatever , `` it 's half a mile away `` or something like that . grad b : mm - hmm . it 's a granularity factor , professor c : yeah . grad b : because where people ask you , `` where is new york ? `` , you will tell them it 's on the east coast . grad d : uh - huh . yeah . exactly . right . right . grad b : y y eh you wo n't tell them how to get there , ft you know , take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah . grad d : yeah . grad b : but if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there . grad d : right . mm - hmm . grad b : so th they have done some interesting experiments on that in hamburg as well . grad d : right . right . professor c : but i go go back to the the uh , th grad b : so i w this is `` onto `` is is knowledge about buildings , professor c : yeah , that slide . grad b : their opening times , and then t coupled with time of day , um , this should you know . grad d : so that context was like , um , their presumed purpose context , i like business or travel , as well as the utterance context , like , `` i 'm now standing at this place at this time `` . professor c : yeah , well i think we ought to d a as we have all along , d we we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context , which is what you have as context , and discourse context , grad b : mm - hmm . professor c : which you have as dh , i do n't know what the h means . grad b : history . discourse history . yeah . professor c : ok . whatever . so we can work out terminology later . so , they 're they 're quite distinct . i mean , you need them both , but they 're quite distinct . and , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics . except to find out what seems to be useful . so , the the the reason the belief - net is in blue , is the notion would be uh , this may be a bad dis bad idea , but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way , given these we have all these transcripts and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net . saying , `` aha ! here 're the things which , if you get them out of out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . `` and if to actually do that , build it , um you know , run it y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe the parameters . and see how that goes . if that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . so where would you get this information ? and , expand it to to other things like this . but if we ca n't do that , then we 're in trouble . i mean th th i i if you ca n't do this task , um grad b : we need a different , uh , engine . machine , i mean . professor c : uh , uh , yeah , or something . well it i i if it if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing , but i do n't think that 's gon na be the case . i think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it . the real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ? and i do n't know . grad b : hmm . but , only w professor c : hold on a s hold on a second . so , i know . uh , uh , is it clear what 's going on here ? grad d : um , i missed the beginning , but , um i guess could you back to the slide , the previous one ? so , is it that it 's , um these are all factors that uh , a these are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now ? or that we want to take into account ? you were saying n professor c : take them into account . but but you do n't worry about h grad d : take the the linguistic factors too . oh , how to extract these features . professor c : how to extract them . so , f let 's find out which ones we need first , grad d : ok . got it . professor c : and grad d : ok . and and it 's clear from the data , um , like , sorta the correct answer in each case . grad b : no . but professor c : let 's go back to th let 's go back to the the the slide of data . grad d : that 's that 's the thing i 'm curious ab grad b : um grad d : like do we know from the data wh which ok . so grad b : not from that data . but , um , since we are designing a a a an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , { comment } um , we will definitely take care to put it in there , grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad b : in some shape , way , form over the other , grad d : mm - hmm . professor c : yeah . grad b : to see whether we can , then , get sort of empirically validated data . grad d : right . grad b : um , from this , we can sometimes , you know an and that 's that but that is n't that what we need for a belief - net anyhow ? is sort of s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ? but it does n't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still grad d : mm - hmm . right . grad b : you know ? grad d : right . grad b : but then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net . so , um , this is exactly what grad d : right . grad b : because y you can never be sure . and i 'm sure even i the most , sort of , deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say , `` well , if it 's phrased like that , the intention is this . `` grad d : sure . grad b : you know , because then , uh , you grad d : u u i mean , the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task . right ? where you have where your , uh , current goal is to grad b : we yeah ! that 's what we 're doing . but but we will still get the phrasing all over the place . grad d : so that 's what you want ? ok . so you will know . grad b : i 'm sure that , you know professor c : yeah . grad d : mm - hmm . the no , that 's fine . i guess , it 's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject . professor c : yeah . grad b : mm - hmm . professor c : from that task , yeah . so , uh , i think you all know this , but we are going to actually use this little room and start recording subjects probably within a month or something . so , this is not any lo any of you guys ' worry , except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need . so our job is to figure out how to solve these problems . if it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then the sort of data collection branch can be , uh , asked to do that . and one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing uh , recording of subjects . so , yeah y you 're absolutely right , though . no , you you will not have , and there it is , and , uh but you know , y y the , um grad d : and i think the other concern that has come up before , too , is if it 's um i do n't know if this was collected what situation this data was collected in . was it is it the one that you showed in your talk ? like people grad b : no , no . no . grad d : but ok . so was this , like , someone actually mobile , like s using a device ? grad b : uh , n no , no not i it was mobile but not not with a w a real wizard system . so there were never answers . grad d : uh - huh . ok . ok . but , is it i guess i do n't know the situation of of collecting th the data of , like here you could imagine them being walking around the city . as like one situation . and then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that . grad b : mm - hmm . grad d : if they 're doing it in a you know , `` i 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions `` , i i would imagine that the data would be really different . um , so it 's just grad b : yeah . but it was never th th the goal of that data collection to to serve for sat for such a purpose . so that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality , grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : there was n there was no label , grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : you know , intention a , intention b , intention c . grad d : right . grad b : or task a , b , c . um i 'm sure we can produce some if we need it , um , that that will help us along those lines . grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : but , you know , you got ta leave something for other people to model . so , to finding out what , you know , situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s interesting thing . grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad b : u u sort of i 'm , at the moment , curious and i 'm i 'm s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with , grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that , grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : what suffices and what does n't . and then we can start worrying about where to get this input , what what do we need , you know ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it . grad d : mm - hmm . hmm . grad b : it 's a m pragmatic approach , uh , at the moment . grad e : how exactly does the data collection work ? do they have a map , and then you give them a scenario of some sort ? grad b : ok . imagine you 're the the subject . you 're gon na be in here , and somebody and and you see , uh , either th the three - d model , or uh , a quicktime animation of standing u in a square in heidelberg . so you actually see that . um . the uh , um , first thing is you have to read a text about heidelberg . so , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding german street names , like fischergasse and so forth . so that 's part one . part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know , and it understands you completely . and so you 're gon na pick up that phone , dial a number , and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve . first you have to know find out how to get to that place , maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there . maybe so , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild . the third one is to get information on the history of an object . the fourth one and then the g system breaks down . it crashes , and grad d : a at the third ? right then ? grad b : after the third task . and then or after the fourth . some find @ @ { comment } forget that for now . and then , a human operator comes on , and and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? now with a human operator . and so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects , and you go through it again , and that was it . oh , and one one little bit w and uh , the computer you are you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via gps . when the human operator comes on , um , that person does not know . so the gps is crashed as well . so the person first has to ask you `` where are you ? `` . and so you have to do some s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there . um , this is a a a a a bit that i d i do n't think we did we discuss that bit ? uh , i just sort of squeezed that in now . but it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people i know . so . grad d : so , in the display you can oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the grad b : yeah . a additionally , y you have a a a sort of a map type display . grad d : a w your perspective ? sort of ? grad b : uh , two - d . grad d : and so , as you oh , two - d . ok . grad b : two - d . grad d : so as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the for themselves grad b : yeah . b y you do n't that 's grad d : there . grad b : i do n't know . i but y i do n't think you really move , sort of . grad d : ok . so grad b : yeah ? i mean that would be an an an enormous technical effort , unless we would we can show it walks to , you know . we can have movies of walking , you walking through through heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there . grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : maybe we wan na do that . yeah . grad d : uh , i was just trying to figure out how how ambitious the system is . grad b : the map was sort of intended to you want to go to that place . you know , and it 's sort of there . grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : and you see the label of the name so we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that . grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . so your tasks do n't require you to i mean , uh yo you 're told so when your task is , i do n't know , `` go buy stamps `` or something like that ? so , do you have to respond ? or does your uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? like , w what you 're doing now ? or grad b : well , we 'll see what people do . grad d : there 's no ok , so it 's just like , `` let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances `` . grad b : yeah , and and we will record both sides . i mean , we will record the wi - the wizard grad d : uh - huh . grad b : i mean , in both cases it 's gon na be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case . grad d : uh - huh . grad b : and we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ? so , you first have to do this , and that , and and grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : see wh what they say . we can ins instruct the , uh , wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be . but um , maybe the maybe what you 're suggesting is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ? you wan na m have it more more steps , sort of ? grad d : yeah , i i do n't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction i mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system . grad b : mm - hmm . grad d : all they know is it 's this great system that could do s stuff . grad b : mm - hmm . professor c : oh yeah , but to some extent this is a different discussion . grad d : right ? so professor c : ok ? so . uh , we we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff grad d : uh - huh . professor c : and we do have , um , a student who is a candidate for wizard . uh , she 's gon na get in touch with me . it 's a student of eve 's . fey , fey ? spelled fey . do you do you grad d : oh , fey parrill . professor c : you know her ? grad d : yeah . uh - huh . professor c : ok . sh - is sh grad d : she started taking the class last year and then did n't um , you know , did n't continue . i g she 's a g professor c : she 's graduated . grad d : is she an undergradua she is a graduate , ok . professor c : yeah . grad d : yeah , i m i know her very , very briefly . i know she was inter you know , interested in aspect and stuff like that . professor c : ok . so , anyway , she 's looking for some more part time work w while she 's waiting actually for graduate school . and she 'll be in touch . so we may have someone , uh , to do this , and she 's got you know , some background in in all this stuff . and is a linguist st and , so so . that 's so , nancy , we 'll have an at some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gon na go . grad d : mm - hmm . professor c : and um , jane , but also , uh , liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff . grad d : mm - hmm . mmm . professor c : so , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing . grad d : ok . i guess the reason i was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , um , it 's one thing to collect data for , i do n't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers , but with intention um , obviously , as you point out , there 's a lot of di other factors and i 'm not really sure , um , how how e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that um , it 's ju it 's just hard . so , i mean , obviously it 's a grad e : yeah , uh , actually i guess that was my question . is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ? like , do the grad d : it is , if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to grad e : yeah , i just was n't sure to what level of detail the task was . grad d : to to give yeah , grad b : mm - hmm . grad d : uh grad b : n no one is , at the moment . grad d : right . right . professor c : so , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out . grad d : right . professor c : but , uh , grad d : mm - hmm . professor c : the the problem that i was tr gon na try to focus on today was , let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other , you were able to , uh , figure out both the intention , and set the context , and know what language was used . so let 's suppose that we can get that kind of data . um . the issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely . grad d : w what are the t three intentions ? is it to go there , to see it , and grad b : to come as close as possible to it . professor c : th - the terminology we 're using is to grad d : yeah , it 's @ @ . professor c : go back . to v to view it . ok ? to enter it . now those it seems to me those are cl you c you have no trouble with those being distinct . `` take a picture of it `` you you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it . grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c : and , for an object that 's at all big , uh , sort of getting to the nearest part of it uh , could be quite different than either of those . grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c : just sort of grad d : ok , so now i understand the referent of tango mode . i did n't get that before . grad e : see , i would have thought it was more of a waltz . grad b : s to `` waltz `` it ? grad d : yeah , like , how close are you gon na be ? professor c : well . grad d : like , tango 's really close . grad e : yeah , cuz a tango yeah . professor c : well , anyway . so grad f : all these so , like , the question is how what features can like , do you wan na try to extract from , say , the parse or whatever ? professor c : right . grad f : like , the presence of a word or the presence of a certain uh , stem , or certain construction or whatever . professor c : right . is there a construction , or the kind of object , or w uh , anything else that 's in the si it 's either in the in the s the discourse itself or in the context . so if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , ok ? that becomes a feature . now , how you determine that is another issue . but fo for the current problem , it would just be , `` ok , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , `` or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , `` pppt ! `` though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them , grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : and see ho how it worked , and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . from previous discourse or w any anything else you knew . grad f : right . so , how should what 's the uh , plan ? like , how should we go about figuring out these professor c : ok . so , first of all is , uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ? javabayes or something ? grad f : oh . no , not really . professor c : ok . well , anyway . f get one . ok ? so y so one of th one of the things we wan na do is actually , uh , pick a package , does n't matter which one , uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities , cuz a lot of what we 're gon na be d you know , we do n't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . d w these are not gon na get big in in the foreseeable future . but we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify . because i that 's a lot of what it 's gon na be , is , um , playing with this . and probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files . so that if if we have all these cases ok ? so we make up cases that have these features , ok , and then you 'd like to be able to say , `` ok , here 's a bunch of cases `` there 're even ones tha that you can do learning ok ? so you have all their cases and and their results and you have a algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the the probabilities for you . um , probably that 's not worth it . i mean , my guess is we are n't gon na have enough data that 's good enough to make the these data fitting ones worth it , but i do n't know . so i would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package . ok , and you wan na it s you know , the standard things you want it stable , you want it yeah , @ @ . and , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on . grad b : an - nuh . professor c : but it what i like about it is it 's very concrete . ok ? we we have a we know what the outcomes are gon na be , and we have some some data that 's loose , we can use our own intuition , and see how hard it is , and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need . so it if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to you know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . that 'd be really interesting . grad e : mm - hmm . grad b : and it and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis . i mean , w we have the for - framenet group here , and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already , that are contained in the data , um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features and um , maybe even means of s uh , extracting them . and and that altogether could also be uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it . and um when you said javabayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ? or that are in the program language java ? professor c : no , th it turns out that there is a , uh the new end of java libraries . ok , and it turns out one called grad b : mmm . ok . professor c : which is one that fair people around here use a fair amount . i have no idea whether that 's the obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other java packages for guis or whatever else you might want to do . grad b : mm - hmm . professor c : so that i that 's i think why a lot of people doing research use that . but it may not be i have no idea whether that 's the best choice an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe bayes - nets . so , uh , grad d : there 's the m tool kit that um , kevin murphy has developed , professor c : right . it 's ok . grad d : which might be useful too . grad f : right . professor c : so , yeah , kevin would be a good person to start with . grad d : and it 's available matlab code . professor c : nancy knows him well . i do n't know i do n't know whether you guys have met kevin yet or not , grad b : mm - hmm . professor c : but , uh grad f : yeah , i know him . grad b : but i but since we all probably are pretty sure that , um , the professor c : yeah . grad b : for example , this th th the dialogue history is is um , producing xml documents . m - three - l of course is xml . and the ontology that um , uh the student is is constructing for me back in in eml is in oil and that 's also in xml . and so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gon na come from . professor c : mm - hmm . yeah . grad b : um , so , if it has that io capability and if it 's a java package , it will definitely be able we can couple . professor c : yeah . so , yeah , we 're sort of committed to xml as the kind of , uh , interchange . but that 's , you know , not a big deal . grad b : who is n't , nuh ? professor c : so , in terms of of interchanging in and out of any module we build , it 'll be xml . and if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface . but that 's that 's fine an and um , all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind . so they they have worked very hard . it 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a and so forth . so , that i do n't think is even worth us worrying about just yet . i mean if we can get the core of the thing to work , in a way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , uh , xml , um , little descriptors . i believe . grad b : hmm . yeah . yeah , i like , for example , the what you said about the getting input from from just files about where you h where you have the data , have specified the features and so forth . professor c : i do n't i do n't see grad b : that 's , of course , easy also to do with , you know , xml . professor c : uh , you could have an x yeah , you could make and xml format for that . sure . that that um , you know , feature value xml format is probably as good a way as any . so it 's als yeah , i guess it 's also worth , um , while you 're poking around , poke around for xml packages that um , do things you 'd like . grad f : does n't does smartkom system have such packages ? grad b : yeah . professor c : sure . grad b : the the lib m - three - l library does that . it 's also professor c : and the question is , d you c you you 'll have to l we 'll have to l that should be ay we should be able to look at that grad b : no , u u y um the what i what sort of came to my mind i is was the notion of an idea that if if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own , um , probability factors based on on on on input professor c : yeah . grad b : which is in file format , if we , um , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some some corpora that other people made and , for example , if if they are in in mate , then we get x m l documents with discourse annotations , t you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level . grad f : mm - hmm . grad b : um , michael has a project where you know , recognizing discourse acts and he does it all in mate , and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data . so if we w if we think it 's worth it one of these days , not not with this first prototype but maybe with a second , and we have the possibility of of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that , that 'd be nice . grad f : right . professor c : it 'd be nice , but but i i i do i do n't wan na count on it . i mean , you ca n't you ca n't run your project based on the speculation that that the data will come , grad b : no , no , uh , just for professor c : and you do n't have to actually design the nets . grad b : nuh . just a back door that i i think we should devote m professor c : could happen . yeah . so in terms of of the , um the what the smartkom gives us for m - three - l packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh . you do n't you know , you do n't really like it . so we 're not we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages . we are required at the end to give them stuff in their format , but hey . grad f : right . professor c : um , it 's , uh it does n't control what you do in you know , internally . grad e : what 's the time frame for this ? grad b : two days ? two , three days ? professor c : huh ? yeah bu w i 'd like that this y yeah , this week , to ha to n to have y guys , uh , you know , pick the y you know , belief - net package and tell us what it is , and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something . grad f : sure . professor c : and , then as soon as we have it , i think we should start trying to populate it for this problem . make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on , and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way . i mean , you can f figure out whether you wan na make it a web site or you know , how grad b : uh i i i um , ok , i t yeah . i was actually more joking . with the two or three days . so this was was a usual jo professor c : ok , i was n't . grad b : um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that . professor c : yeah . right . grad b : but um , maybe it might be interesting if if the two of you can agree on who 's gon na be the speaker next monday , to tell us something about the net you picked , and what it does , and how it does that . professor c : well , y well , or both of them speak . grad f : sure . grad b : yeah , or you can split it up . professor c : we do n't care . grad b : so , y so that will be sort of the assignment for next week , is to to for slides and whatever net you picked and what it can do and and how far you 've gotten . pppt ! professor c : well , i 'd like to also , though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like . even if it 's really crude . ok ? so , you know , here a here are grad e : so we 're supposed to @ @ about features and whatnot , professor c : right . yeah . grad e : and grad f : mm - hmm . professor c : and , as i said , what i 'd like to do is , i mean , what would be really great is you bring it in if if if we could , uh , in the meeting , say , you know , `` here 's the package , here 's the current one we have , `` uh , you know , `` what other ideas do you have ? `` and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file . of , uh , you know , get a t a p tentative format for it , let 's say xml , that says , l you know , `` these are the various scenarios we 've experienced . `` we can just add to that and there 'll be this this file of them and when you think you 've got a better belief - net , you just run it against this , um this data file . grad f : so we 'll be like , hand , uh , doing all the probabilities . professor c : oh , yeah , unt until we know more . grad e : and what 's the relation to this with changing the table so that the system works in english ? grad b : ok . so this is whi - while you were doing this , i received two lovely emails . the the full nt and the full linux version are there . i 've downloaded them both , and i started to unpack the linux one uh , the nt one worked fine . and i started unta pack the linux one , it told me that i ca n't really unpack it because it contains a future date . so this is the time difference between germany . i had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before i was able to unpack it . now , um then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on swede and on this machine . and so that we have it . and then um hopefully that hoping that my urgent message will now come through to ralph and tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we i control p maybe that 's what i will do next monday is show the state and show the system and show that . professor c : yeah . yeah . so the answer , johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to english and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net . grad e : i guess my question was more about time frame . so we 're gon na do belief - nets this week , and then professor c : oh , yeah . i do n't know . n none of this is i n neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a there 's a deliverable . ok . s so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . if if you know , if we do n't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we are n't gon na sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they you know , just pppt ! go on and do other things . grad b : yeah , but uh but the uh this point is really i think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , ie , changing the table so it does exactly in english what it does in german , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , `` ok , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it `` , you know ? whatever , johno 's and bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gon na be a core domain of the new system , it all all of a sudden it does much better . nuh ? because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as i s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the vista point or a red line that goes to the tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . so not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building , which is what they do now . and we even had to take out a bit . nancy , you missed that part . we had to take out a bit of the road work . so that it does n't take you to the wall every time . grad d : oh , really ? grad b : so . um so this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have has because car navigation systems do n't really care . you know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number . but even that is problematic . grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : if you go d if you wan na drive to the sap in waldorf , i 'm sure the same is true of microsoft , it takes you to the the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance . because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . nuh ? grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : but the entrance where you actually wan na go is somewhere completely different . so unless you 're a mail person you really do n't wan na go there . grad d : right , yeah . professor c : probably not then , cuz y you probably ca n't drop the mail there anyway . grad b : probably neither e not even that . professor c : yeah . clear ? grad f : ok . sounds good . grad e : the powder - tower is made of red limestone . grad d : i was wondering . grad b : do you wan na see a picture ? grad d : ok . sure ! grad e : sure ! grad b : have to reboot for that though . grad d : um . so , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are are you gl will you be doing well , i mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ?
