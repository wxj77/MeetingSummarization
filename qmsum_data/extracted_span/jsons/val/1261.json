    "answer": "industrial designer : mm . i think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh ka kate cat cat 's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . marketing : cat 's . ca . industrial designer : so if we need to have a target group um then uh i think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . um . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah , i mean that 's the thing is that it did n't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , industrial designer : right . marketing : but i 'm assuming , you know , yes . industrial designer : right . bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , project manager : yeah . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it 'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , project manager : mm-hmm . yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : then again i guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket industrial designer : right , and project manager : and the i do n't know how often they 're buying televisions . industrial designer : right . mm . marketing : well , that 's when you go to uni , is n't it ? so , you know project manager : yeah , but you do n't have much money , generally . user interface : yeah . yeah , project manager : i would 've thought it 's it 's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they 've got their first job and they want their nice toys and user interface : you share a television or something that yeah . industrial designer : right . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but uh still , if if you can go back to that slide and uh , how popular was it ? project manager : o oh it 's on marketing : oh , i 've unplugged it . project manager : sorry , we unplugged it . industrial designer : oh , oh , okay . marketing : do you want me to project manager : here , let me industrial designer : that 's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : seventy six point three percent . industrial designer : so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . user interface : it was seventy something , yeah , yeah . industrial designer : so even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ? marketing : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah , i kn i mean i know what you 're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , project manager : yeah . marketing : but i mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they do n't have like i mean , you know , if you 're at university , you 're paying your rent , project manager : yeah , they 've got no commitments and marketing : but you do n't have a mortgage , you do n't have a life insurance policy , industrial designer : alright . marketing : you do n't normally have a car , project manager : usually not a car and all of those things . marketing : yeah , so . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : you 're still learning to drive actually , project manager : kids . yeah . industrial designer : so you 're more likely to b marketing : so that just costs more than a car , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : marketing : but yeah . um so i mean like it is an age group to target , really , i think . project manager : yeah , and if we 're if we 're talking twenty five euros as a price , that 's not unaffordable , even for young people . marketing : no , i mean that 's what , that 's like fifteen pounds ? you know , i think project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah this this is not unaffordable , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a tv to use its full project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah , i d i do n't know many people without a tv . we did n't have a tv last year , project manager : but do they user interface : yeah . marketing : and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know . project manager : but the tvs are often kind of someone 's old tv that 's blah blah user interface : common , the students yeah , yeah . the s the stu project manager : and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote . user interface : yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , it might not even function with the old tv . marketing : industrial designer : bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it 's quite popular , right ? project manager : marketing : yeah , i d well we 've we 've got quite a d decent tv . user interface : yeah , industrial designer : so mm uh are are are project manager : yeah . user interface : we 're still yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh marketing : i think i think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , i would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . project manager : yeah . marketing : you know , so i mean that and the disposable income and i do n't think it 's something to ignore , you know . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah , but at the same time i think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , project manager : yeah . user interface : because actually i mean they 're all still re young people . marketing : is not a massive difference , you know . no , do totally . project manager : yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , user interface : yeah . project manager : but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : um project manager : is that gon na have a an implication for the technical specs ? industrial designer : i was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself i 'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? uh and uh project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : you do have it in your mobile phone though , do n't you ? because you have like i mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . but how frequently do we use it anyway user interface : yeah . industrial designer : and um uh h ho how good is it , user interface : yeah . industrial designer : you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh marketing : i do n't know . project manager : yeah . with um but with a tv remote it 's gon na be quite limited if we 're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : right . marketing : s so project manager : louder , industrial designer : right . okay . project manager : tha that should be relatively simple . industrial designer : o marketing : y you 'd maybe need a code word . do you know what i mean ? industrial designer : right . marketing : so like when you say change , except that 's being said quite a lot on tv , so maybe like , you know , remote . i mean how often do people say remote on tv ? project manager : yeah . marketing : although i only watch charmed , so really i would n't know industrial designer : project manager : marketing : but like so you 'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . industrial designer : right . yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , but maybe if you wan na look into that just to just to check . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we 're going to get th anyone who 's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , user interface : yeah but uh um yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . project manager : then they 'll they 'll still go for the same advertising . user interface : yeah . marketing : i do n't think there 's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls . user interface : yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but i think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons project manager : yeah , user interface : and um , yeah it 's it 's kind of safer , so we we need both , industrial designer : mm . w project manager : i think we need both . industrial designer : what uh user interface : so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it would n't really reduce the size of the remote . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : what wh uh what i was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on tv and how they are numbered on the remote control . if we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , i want to watch uh i_tv one instead of saying that i want to go onto channel number forty five . project manager : uh-huh . uh-huh . industrial designer : yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , marketing : yeah , that would be another way to do it . project manager : so that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great . industrial designer : some kind of marketing : yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because i mean sky advertise on every channel , do n't they , you know , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . marketing : so then it would be you 'd be watching charmed , and then the sky advert would come on and it would change to sky . project manager : watch sky and yeah . industrial designer : alright . marketing : yeah , yeah , industrial designer : yeah , that 's marketing : and that would be really annoying . industrial designer : right . project manager : mm-hmm . but that 's definitely a possibility . user interface : yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control is n't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it project manager : yeah . user interface : and and the tv would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . marketing : yeah . do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? project manager : so that you can yell at it , industrial designer : marketing : yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . project manager : yeah . marketing : it 's more like if you lost it and it 's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it 'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . industrial designer : project manager : industrial designer : project manager : yeah . alright . user interface : yeah , but then the remote control i think i mean um the idea is kind of it 's it 's not that it 's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you would n't you you would n't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . marketing : yeah , yeah , i suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then industrial designer : mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you 're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control project manager : mm . yeah . user interface : yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer : being cl i mean it 'll it 'll mm . user interface : no , but i i i was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm . so uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the tv , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it 'll beep , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : so we we can probably come to know where it is . project manager : that 's marketing : yeah . project manager : but then if you 're buying the remote separately , user interface : okay . project manager : but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the tv or something , user interface : oh yeah , yeah . industrial designer : right , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager : some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the tv . user interface : okay , yeah , mm-hmm . marketing : yeah , 'cause it 's it 's quite important that you do n't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . industrial designer : alright , yeah . project manager : well that 's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises . marketing : yeah , definitely , yeah . project manager : yeah . okay , i think we 're gon na have to wrap this up um . but if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we 're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it 's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option user interface : the major ones , yeah . industrial designer : right . project manager : um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it 's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : okay . project manager : what we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you 'll get immediately by email . send me your presentations so that i can use them to make the minutes , and then we 've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : um i 'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but i 'll send you an email when i do it , so that you know . industrial designer : so where exactly is this i project manager : it should be on your desktop , so on the industrial designer : ah , okay . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : so i 'll put it i 'll put them there as soon as i 've written them . user interface : did you find it ? industrial designer : yeah , yeah in that one , user interface : it 's just yeah , yeah . industrial designer : right yeah . project manager : yeah , and email them round . marketing : oh , so y you want our um powerpoint presentations in there , hey ? project manager : yeah , that would be great . marketing : okay . user interface : oh so so we 'll just put them i there , project manager : oh yeah , put them in there . yeah , user interface : we we yeah , w we wo n't even okay . marketing : there you go . project manager : then you do n't have to email them . marketing : but is everyone 's called functional requirements ? project manager : no , they 're all called something slightly different . technical requirements and something something , yeah . marketing : okay , so that 's good . user interface : yeah . marketing : that 's me done . project manager : so , if you put them in there , we 'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . marketing : okay , cool . project manager : um as to where we 're going from here , you 're going to look at the components concept . industrial designer : right . project manager : yeah ? whatever that means . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : i guess i 'll find out . project manager : yeah . marketing : project manager : you 'll be looking you 'll be looking at the user interface concept , user interface : uh something conceptual , yeah . project manager : on something conceptual and you 're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition 'll fall off the map or something that marketing : project manager : um we 'll keep keep our options op hmm ? industrial designer : wha what was it again that i was supposed to look into ? con components , oh . project manager : components , user interface : hmm . project manager : yeah . user interface : sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our project manager : no , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , user interface : to prepare , okay , yeah , that 's good . project manager : so that 's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . user interface : okay . project manager : okay ?
