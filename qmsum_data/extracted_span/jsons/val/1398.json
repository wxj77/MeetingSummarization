    "answer": "project manager : okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria marketing : okay . project manager : and then we 'll there industrial designer : yeah , see the budget . project manager : i suspect we 're gon na have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we 'll se i 'm sure we can get around them somehow . marketing : industrial designer : project manager : we 'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country industrial designer : project manager : and cut some of the prices that way . user interface : marketing : wales . industrial designer : project manager : wales , for example . marketing : mm . cool , okay . right , okay . fabulous , project manager : marketing expert . marketing : yeah . okay , cool . so what we 're gon na do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design . um so we 're gon na be using a seven point scale , project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really does n't , we need to go back and start again . um , you know . basically , what i did was i went through all the like user requirements and things that we 've done and we 've worked on and like made a list of them . um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : cool , so these are what they are . oh project manager : so for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . is that right ? marketing : yes , i did have a_ , b_ , c_ , and d_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . project manager : mm dots , never mind . marketing : okay . but if you can imagine that they say a_ , b_ , c_ , and d_ , then that would be really good . industrial designer : i guess we 'll give it maximum points in everything . user interface : yeah , the yeah , it 's definitely attractive . industrial designer : project manager : yeah , i agree . user interface : oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . marketing : well , i thought we 'd um kinda said that you 'd have a little thing to stick on the tv ? project manager : yeah , just prepare one now . user interface : yeah . shall i just prepare it now ? marketing : yeah . user interface : it will be red , too . marketing : cool . okay . so , be attractive to look at . that 's this one . what do you all say ? project manager : i reckon it user interface : s seven was th the maximum , yeah ? marketing : yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : i i go for seven . industrial designer : yes . marketing : oh we 're all so proud of the . project manager : seven , yeah , it 's terribly sexy . yeah . marketing : okay , so that 'll be a seven for a_ . user interface : marketing : could oh no , you ca n't whilst that 's up there . okay um uh what i 've done on the next page is i 've set it up so we just put the marks in . project manager : ah , okay . industrial designer : okay . project manager : excellent . except we ca n't marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but we can we can marketing : but that 's alright . project manager : uh we can if we industrial designer : i can i can take note uh uh marketing : if you take a note of them , and then i 'll put them in in a minute . project manager : then yeah , i 'll take a note , it 's fine . marketing : okay , so we 're all agreeing on seven for a_ ? project manager : yeah . marketing : cool , okay . does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? industrial designer : um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , project manager : i think it does . user interface : i would think yes , yeah . marketing : yeah . i mean industrial designer : so if you 're left-handed you 're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . user interface : yeah , project manager : alright . user interface : so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . marketing : yeah . project manager : but that 's gon na be a problem , industrial designer : but then yeah . project manager : 'cause you do n't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : so bu it 's it 's not a huge problem , marketing : i th i think it 's not it 's not like it 's a pen . industrial designer : because i i it is operatable . user interface : but then then i think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , project manager : yeah . user interface : so they just marketing : yeah , but i mean because it 's not like it 's a pen , you know , left-handed people ca n't normally write right-handed , user interface : yeah . marketing : but they can normally do most things right-handed , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : right . marketing : so i would say it 's not such a big issue . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , because i mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . project manager : yeah . user interface : so i if the majority are right-handed , it 's uh project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so i mean that does kind of negate the whole r_s_i_ issue . project manager : yeah . marketing : so maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , i would say ? project manager : um marketing : what do you what do you all think ? user interface : or maybe six , because it 's just one one i one among the issues , project manager : yeah , i think i think for um user interface : i mean . yeah . project manager : i mean most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , i think it 's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to um user interface : yeah . industrial designer : one more thing is that i marketing : okay . industrial designer : it might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , project manager : they industrial designer : so it opens on the side . so project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : no , yeah , but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah . industrial designer : yeah yeah yeah , i mean yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : so it wo n't be a problem , marketing : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : so you guys can decide wh whether user interface : it will be and it will be it wo n't be heavy . industrial designer : oops . marketing : i th i think the alternative is flipping from the top . industrial designer : yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah . user interface : yeah well yeah , project manager : the length is gon na be difficu user interface : but it 's it 's a bit long . it 's a little bit long . marketing : yeah um user interface : well , i mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . marketing : but you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? industrial designer : uh this this kind of uh makes it more marketing : because user interface : s uh slightly smaller . industrial designer : and two , it might interfere with the i_r_ channel . marketing : so you have to keep that side flat . user interface : yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . industrial designer : okay . marketing : so it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side 's flat , than that will work . industrial designer : right . okay . marketing : okay . um okay , so c_ . are are we admitting defeat on c_ or are we saying we 're gon na stick a locator on the tv ? industrial designer : no , we have a locator . project manager : no , we 're gon na put it like we 've got th there 's the locator dot . marketing : there 's a locator . cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , user interface : mm that you stick on tv . marketing : does n't it ? to make it beep . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : or a buzzer . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds , so yeah . marketing : okay . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so that 's two , so that 's seven , yeah . it 's locatable ? fabulous . d_ . industrial designer : intuitive , completely intuitive . marketing : project manager : user interface : yeah . if uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things project manager : yeah . user interface : and it 's i th i think it 's project manager : i 'd say six , 'cause the i mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you 've got it . i really like the way you have it , marketing : yeah . project manager : but it 's not the immediate thing that you 're used to . industrial designer : intuitive . marketing : yeah , and i mean d industrial designer : and uh even the scroll , it 's a it 's a new technology project manager : so industrial designer : so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni project manager : might be industrial designer : so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it 's a good technology , i mean once they get used to it . project manager : but it and it 's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : so , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , project manager : five ? marketing : but it 's different , so , do you know , i mean it 's obvious how to use it , project manager : yeah . marketing : but you might have to think about it first . so we give that one a five , you think ? industrial designer : yeah , okay . i 'm gon na give a seven in everything , so . project manager : i 'm happy with five ? user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : i 'm glad you 're accepting this . it has taken a little while , has n't it ? um intuitive but sorry , it 's really hard to write on those . industrial designer : mm . marketing : i just went a bit mad , did n't i ? project manager : marketing : um okay , cool , e_ , okay . um i would guess this comes back from this whole b_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . investigate . project manager : yep . but otherwise it 's superb . marketing : so , should we give it a six ? user interface : um uh the ergonom ergonomic design project manager : yeah . user interface : well mm i mean i d uh i dunno , i mean the the repetitive stress things , industrial designer : . user interface : but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , industrial designer : yeah . yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting . user interface : yeah ? see . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah , so it 's kinda industrial designer : yeah , i i think it is ergonomic . marketing : i used to send fifty texts a day , you know , project manager : well we 've banned them from marketing : and i never got repetitive strain injury from that , project manager : industrial designer : mm yeah . marketing : so i find it quite hard to believe to be honest . industrial designer : and moreover it it has um lcd and everything , project manager : yeah . industrial designer : so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah , it 's varied . marketing : okay , so we give that a six , project manager : yeah . six ? marketing : yeah . okay , f_ . user interface : yeah , it does have yeah . industrial designer : absolutely . project manager : voice control have seven . marketing : hang on , how come it 's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? that 's just project manager : ah , that 's the second one . so you must have changed it on this one where it 's got score , but not on the previous slide . marketing : oh okay , cool . um right , so . industrial designer : so it has voice control . marketing : yes , so that 's a seven then . um , cool . industrial designer : project manager : g_ technologically innovative . industrial designer : anyway it ha yeah , user interface : technologi well industrial designer : it 's the most sophisticated remote that i ever seen . marketing : project manager : but in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . user interface : yeah . well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it 's kind of new . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah , but i mean you do n't project manager : all of the components have been used in other things before . industrial designer : yeah , but they 've been brought together in a remote . user interface : but at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . marketing : they 're never been used i they 've never been using remote remote control before i do n't think . project manager : but do yeah , yeah . yeah . marketing : . project manager : what do you reckon , five , six ? marketing : yeah , what do you all think ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : i mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? project manager : yeah . industrial designer : marketing : well , that 's it , i mean user interface : it still has to do what i what it has to do . industrial designer : marketing : yeah , but i mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , has n't it ? project manager : marketing : so , i do n't think many peop project manager : space remote . industrial designer : marketing : that 's it , they can take it with them . user interface : project manager : put fashion in electronics . industrial designer : absolutely . user interface : yeah , is n't it fashionable ? project manager : industrial designer : the carrot banana remote . user interface : yeah , sure . project manager : user interface : it 's the maximum fashion . marketing : so , we give it seven , and we write user interface : fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : there we go . industrial designer : i think that 's a . user interface : so i think we 've done very well , but industrial designer : yeah . marketing : cool . project manager : very good . user interface : what 's the assessment ? marketing : so , we need the average here , so we got user interface : the average is about six and something . project manager : yeah , one . user interface : a little bit over six . marketing : seven industrial designer : there are how many sixes ? project manager : or a seven . industrial designer : one , two , three . marketing : so we 've got four sevens , user interface : no , wait , a little bit under six . marketing : so that 's twenty eight , industrial designer : three . user interface : no , wait . marketing : three sixes , industrial designer : and one five . marketing : eighteen . user interface : oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . project manager : fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . industrial designer : okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . forty six and five , fifty one . project manager : six point point industrial designer : fifty one divided by user interface : six point something , yeah . marketing : two three four seven eight . project manager : about six point five . user interface : six point five , yeah . project manager : close enough . marketing : okay , that 's pretty good , i think . project manager : now wait until we get to finance and then we 'll see if we can afford it . marketing : project manager : that 's all you 've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?
