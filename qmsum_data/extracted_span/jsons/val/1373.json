    "query": "<s> what did huw irranca-davies think about the flying start scheme when talking about the impact on children ?",
    "answer": "huw irranca-davies am : yes , but the fact that flying start , we know , is leading to those outcomes where those children , in quite challenged circumstances very often , are more ready to step up to the foundation year , are more ready , then , to step through into mainstream education in later years\u2014those things tie together . so , there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family , by the way , within this offer , let alone the childcare . that does n't mean that everybody 's excluded , but it does mean , yes , that this offer is focused on working parents . and we do n't think that that 's a bad thing . in fact , it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election , which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags , which is , ' i ca n't afford to go back to work because i ca n't afford the childcare . do n't tell me to go back to work , i ca n't afford it . ' llyr gruffydd am : the majority of disadvantaged children do n't live in flying start areas , do they ?"
