    "query": "<s> what did bains say about the arts , culture , and tourism industry ?",
    "answer": "mr. john nater : mr . chair , the arts and culture industry has a massive impact on local economies . in my riding alone we have the canadian baseball hall of fame and museum , the stratford festival , drayton entertainment and stratford summer music . the postponement and cancellation of the seasons of these important cultural institutions is having a massive impact on the hospitality industry , including local restaurants , hotels and bed and breakfasts . many of these businesses are small businesses and owner-operated businesses that are falling through the cracks in the government 's programs that have been introduced . how will the government address the blind spot in their programs for small businesses in communities like this , which rely on the tourism and the arts and culture industries ? hon . navdeep bains : mr . chair , clearly , we understand how important these organizations are to these communities . that is why we allocated $ 500 million to respond to the specific financial needs of arts , heritage and sports organizations , to help them be more resilient through this difficult time . last week we rolled out the funding of this announcement , and we look forward to engaging with communities across the country ."
