    "answer": "marketing : so we 've listed a couple of uh user interface : functions . marketing : s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . project manager : marketing : people want to have a power button . channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant . project manager : marketing : ah now i remember what is r_s_i_ project manager : marketing : it 's repetitivity stress injury . we have to be careful with that word but uh anyway i continue my presentation so yeah , user interface : marketing : channel selection is um very important , very often used . volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . and n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . all of them . they 're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . it seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if i personally never use it but seems that it 's average relevant at least , so . project manager : i have been told that we uh do n't consider teletext , that it 's out of date now because of internet . marketing : i can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were had i think ten i think . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but but if you compare with these ones , uh i think they scored a one or two . not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it 's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant . project manager : mm-hmm user interface : mm-hmm ."
