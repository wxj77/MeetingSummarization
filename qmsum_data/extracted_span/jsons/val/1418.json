    "answer": "lynne neagle am : thank you very much . the next questions , then , are from dawn bowden on safeguarding and child protection . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair , and thank you , deputy minister , because one of the questions i was going to ask was around some of the work that you 've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection , and i think you 've covered that . but what i 'm particularly keen to find out is how you 're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round . i know the health minister raised this as a concern in plenary only recently , and it 's really how we are monitoring it , what concerns have been identified , and how we 're going to start to tackle some of those . julie morgan am : yes . thank you very much , dawn , for that question . obviously , it is difficult to monitor if there 's not easy access to the children that we 're referring to , and that 's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings . and there 's been a lot of encouragement for that happen . the minister , the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities , asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school . in fact , we 've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings , and that 's the highest number that we 've had at all since the opening of the scheme . but it 's still only a tiny drop in the ocean . but it 's very good , and it is progress that the numbers attending are now going up . but , of course , there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing . there has been a drop in safeguarding referrals to social services . those numbers are now beginning to go up , but there certainly was a significant drop , which is a great deal of concern . one local authority , in fact , reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year . so , i issued a written statement on 1 may , setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children , young people and safeguarding work stream , and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are . because , obviously , we are dependent on the public authorities\u2014you know , schools and health services\u2014to report any concerns , and at the moment , obviously , they 're not there to report them . so , we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other , and i was very interested in what si\u00e2n gwenllian told me about what was being done in anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen , and to raise their concerns , because , obviously , safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community . but i think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are , in fact , keeping close touch , as far as they possibly can , with all the children that are vulnerable . for those where it is very critical , face-to-face contact is still taking place , and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families . so , it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it , but i think as much as possible is being done . lynne neagle am : jean , you wanted to come in on that . professor jean white : just to add to what the deputy minister was saying , the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back . it has consolidated some of the ways that it does the healthy child wales programme , but , for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable , all the normal contacts have been maintained , so they 're not unseen to the normal health visiting service . that covers both flying start and general health visiting areas . thank you . dawn bowden am : thank you , jean , for that , and , deputy minister , would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current welsh government definition and guidance around vulnerable children , in terms of who we identify as vulnerable ? because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable . so , it 's just looking at the current guidance that we have . do you think that needs revisiting at all ? julie morgan am : the definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs , and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised . but we have now looked at this again , and we 've set out an expanded definition , and we intend to publish that this week . this does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services . because , obviously , the children that we know about , we know about , but there are those other children who may be on the edge of care\u2014the children that we 've been trying very hard , as part of our policies in the welsh government , to keep with their families , with a lot of support . those are the ones that we also want to support . so , we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility , and that will be published this week . dawn bowden am : thank you . thank you , chair . lynne neagle am : thank you . we 're going to move on now , then , to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care , with questions from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : thank you , chair . can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system , including edge-of-care services , and where have there been areas of concern ? julie morgan am : well , local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the covid emergency , so a red-amber-green rating risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services . this is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis , so every case that is known is being rag rated and services are being linked to that . also , there is very close contact between welsh government officials and the local authorities . there are weekly meetings between officials and the heads of the children 's services . i ca n't speak too highly , really , about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on . we 've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children , and the number of placement breaks are minimal . the other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus , and , obviously , that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce . so , there 's very close contact . the children are all being monitored individually , and i think in the circumstances we 're all doing what we possibly can . i know that albert heaney is able , probably , to respond in more detail to the contacts , if you 'd like to have that . lynne neagle am : i think we 'll move on to the next section . can i remind everyone again : sharp focused questions and concise answers ? janet . janet finch-saunders am : thanks . how is welsh government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks ? julie morgan am : it is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers , so that is part of our normal practice . we 're very keen as a welsh government that no children are left behind in their education during this period . so , last month , as you will know , the minister for education announced \u00a33 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they 've got access to the internet , so that they can fully participate in online learning . so , we do normally ensure that they 've got digital contact for social workers . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . can you set out the picture regarding children 's residential care ? what are the challenges these care settings are facing , and have any children 's homes closed ? julie morgan am : residential children 's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues , and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened . so , i 'm very pleased to report that . we obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported , and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings , and that is going on , although it may be by technology rather than face to face . we know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge , and i think it \u2019 s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult . so , there have been a few issues related to that , but , where that has happened , local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis , and really there are not any major issues . in terms of residential care , hillside is functioning well\u2014no reporting issues . the staffing levels are normal . there are fewer children and young people there , so , in fact , there 's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children , and i think we 've had very good reports about how that has happened . so , i am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be . i also meet with the children 's commissioner once a week , who is an independent source , and she said when i met her last week , 'well , as far as we know , it 's all good news ' . so , i do n't think we have any concerns at the moment about the residential care . janet finch-saunders am : okay . moving on to foster care , how is welsh government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the association of fostering and adoption cymru and its fostering guidelines ? julie morgan am : we have worked with the fostering organisations . we have had close communications with them , and we 've supported afa cymru to develop guidance for foster carers , and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector . we 're working with the third sector . i think i mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and , of course , care leavers . the fostering network has extended its helpline hours , and , of course , voices from care\u2014i mentioned them before\u2014have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers . i 've been reassured , as well , from voices from care that the young people appear to be more stable now\u2014that they have contact with . but that 's online help for them . so , we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services . janet finch-saunders am : so , the final point on that , then : the fostering network and others , as you know , have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer , with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses . what is your position on this , please ? julie morgan am : well , we have n't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers , but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people , i believe , have increased the amount of money that they are paying . they 've also given support for various activities and things\u2014have helped sometimes , i think , with broadband access and that sort of issue . and , obviously , foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you . albert , i just wanted to check there was n't anything you wanted to add , please ."
