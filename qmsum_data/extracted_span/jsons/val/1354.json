    "answer": "grad a : mm - hmm , hmm . grad e : ok , side one . grad f : i keep , uh , like , pointing forward to it . yeah . now we 'll go back to s ok , so this does n't include something which mi mi may have some effect on on it , which is , um , the discourse situation context record , right ? so i did n't i i meant just like draw a line and like , you know , you also have , uh , some tracking of what was going on . professor c : right . grad f : and sort of this is a big scale comment before i , you know , look into the details of this . but for instance you could imagine instead of having i i changed the name of um it used to be `` entities `` . so you see it 's `` scenario `` , `` referent `` and `` discourse segment `` . and `` scenario `` is essentially what kind of what 's the basic predication , what event happened . and actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ? um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : you know , specific x - schema frames . ok , whatever . the middle thing used to be `` entities `` because you could imagine it should be like really a list where here was various information . and this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about . so `` harry walked into the room `` , `` harry `` and `` room `` , you know , the room th but they would be represented in this list somehow . and it could also have for instance , it has this category slot . um , it should be either category or in or instance . basically , it could be a pointer to ontology . so that everything you know about this could be could be drawn in . but the important things for grammatical purposes are for things like number , gender , um ki the ones i included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth if it 's a group whether , um , some event is happening , linear time , linear spaces , like , you know , are are they doing something serially or is it like , um , uh i 'm i 'm not sure . because this partly came from , uh , talmy 's schema and i 'm not sure we 'll need all of these actually . but um , and then the `` status `` i used was like , again , in some languages , you know , like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status . so , th the the big com and and finally `` discourse segment `` is about sort of speech - act - y information structure - y , like utterance - specific kinds of things . so the comment i was going to make about , um , changing entity the entity 's block to reference is that you can imagine your discourse like situation context , you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to . and you might that might be sort of a general , i do n't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to . and i changed to `` reference `` cuz i would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it . and those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here . for instance , i know it 's going to be plural . i know it 's gon na be feminine or something like that . and and these could actually just point to , you know , the the id in my other list of enti active entities , right ? so , um , uh , th there 's there 's all this stuff about discourse status . we 've talked about . i almost listed `` discourse status `` as a slot where you could say it 's active . you know , there 's this , um , hierarchy uh there 's a schematization of , you know , things can be active or they can be , um , accessible , inaccessible . grad e : yeah . grad f : it was the one that , you know , keith , um , emailed to us once , to some of us , not all of us . and the thing is that that i noticed that that , um , list was sort of discourse dependent . it was like in this particular set , s you know , instance , it has been referred to recently or it has n't been , grad e : yeah . grad f : or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active . professor c : this uh yeah , well there there seems to be context properties . yeah . grad f : yeah , they 're contex and for instance , i used to have a location thing there but actually that 's a property of the situation . and it 's again , time , you know at cert certain points things are located , you know , near or far from you professor c : well , uh , uh , this is recursive grad f : and professor c : cuz until we do the uh , mental space story , we 're not quite sure { comment } th - th grad f : yeah . professor c : which is fine . we 'll just we 'll j grad f : yeah , yeah . so some of these are , uh professor c : we just do n't know yet . grad f : right . so i so for now i thought , well maybe i 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance , right ? everything else here is utterance - specific . um , and i left the slot , `` predications `` , open because you can have , um , things like `` the guy i know from school `` . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make . and it 's unclear whether i mean , you could just have in your scenario , `` here are some extra few things that are true `` , right ? grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : and then you could just sort of not have this slot here . right ? you 're but but it 's used for identification purposes . professor c : right . grad e : yeah . grad f : so it 's it 's a little bit different from just saying `` all these things are true from my utterance `` . grad e : yeah . right , `` this guy i know from school came for dinner `` does not mean , um , `` there 's a guy , i know him from school , and he came over for dinner `` . that 's not the same effect . grad f : yeah , it 's a little bit it 's a little bit different . right ? so or maybe that 's like a restrictive , non - restrictive grad e : yeah . grad f : you know , it 's like it gets into that kind of thing for um , but maybe i 'm mixing , you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence . grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : so you might imagine that the information you pass to , you know in identifying a particular referent would be , `` oh , some `` you know , `` it 's a guy and it 's someone i know from school `` . grad e : yeah . grad f : so maybe that would , you know , be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the , whatever , construal engine or whatever , discourse context , to find you know , either create this reference , grad e : mm - hmm . grad f : in which case it 'd be created here , and you know , so so you could imagine that this might not so , uh , i 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things . grad a : but to make it m precise at least in my mind , uh , it 's not precise . so `` house `` is gender neuter ? in reality"
