    "answer": "project manager : okay . so , this is uh first meeting of this design project . um and i um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , i do n't know if it was sent round to all of you . user interface : mm , yeah . project manager : maybe not . anyway , user interface : i did n't receive it yet . project manager : this is the the plan for today 's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although i 'm sure you 've actually got some of the information already . then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we 'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it . and then that 's it . so we 've got twenty five minutes to do that , that 's until eleven twenty five . industrial designer : so sh project manager : s so any any questions ? industrial designer : . project manager : is i not at this point . user interface : not at this point . project manager : so this is our project . what we 're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . the method that we 're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . there 's the functional design of the the remote control . we 're going the way we 'll do that i think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . um similarly with the conceptual design , we 'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we 'll bring what we 've done together . um and then the detailed design will come after that . we 'll pull it all together . industrial designer : i 'm a bit confused about uh what 's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as i understand it ? project manager : i think it th w we 're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you 'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer : right . project manager : and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . industrial designer : how how it will be done . so whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? uh i think it 's it 's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it 's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager : um i think we 'll we 'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer : okay . project manager : yeah . okay , so that 's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . um what i 'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we 're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . so each person in turn , i 'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen 's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you 're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you 're taking in this project . industrial designer : marketing : why are you looking at me ? user interface : marketing : project manager : would you like to go first ? marketing : do i have a choice ? industrial designer : marketing : okay . ooh ooh , things falling everywhere . project manager : oh , yeah , marketing : right , okay . project manager : p put them in pockets . marketing : cool . okay . project manager : you do n't have to hurry , we 've got plenty of time . marketing : so , my name 's cat and i 'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer : project manager : marketing : so um user interface : marketing : okay . user interface : industrial designer : project manager : it 's got no eyes . marketing : oh , good point . ah , the eyes always ruin it . right . okay , what do it 's eyes like ?

project manager : okay , here 's a space . marketing : user interface : it looks very very cute . project manager : yeah , i like the cow . i 'm jen . user interface : yeah . mm-hmm . project manager : um i like dogs too , but i ca n't do that already because i ca n't draw a dog as well as you can . user interface : project manager : i like mm . marketing : is that a lizard ? industrial designer : no way . user interface : project manager : it 's a gecko . industrial designer : ah okay . user interface : ah , a gecko , okay . project manager : yeah . marketing : is there a difference ? user interface : is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager : they 're yeah , they 're l it 's a kind of lizard . user interface : yeah , they are project manager : and i i like geckos user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : because they remind me of warm places industrial designer : uh-huh . project manager : and , and where i was living in cambodia they used to live in my house user interface : ah . marketing : project manager : and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : user interface : i hope you do n't like snakes , do you ? project manager : i do n't like snakes . i come from australia user interface : okay . project manager : and we have nasty snakes . that 's where i 'm from , australia . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : i 'm from melbourne and i 'm your project manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . user interface : wonderful . project manager : okay . industrial designer : thank you . project manager : so , let 's see what 's next in the powerpoint presentation . so , i 've just thought marketing : if you right click on it you can project manager : yeah i 've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing : industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : project manager : there we go . okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . we 've got um we 're planning to sell these remote controls for let 's make that go away , that means we 've got five minutes . um we 're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each . um and with that we 're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros . and that 's selling them on the international market , not just in the u_k_ . um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half euro so that we can reach that profit target . so that 's something to keep in mind while you 're designing . okay . hmm . this is let me just skip ahead to see that 's the last thing , okay . we 've only got a couple of minutes . does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we 're thinking of this remote control ? user interface : yep . i 'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . project manager : mm-hmm . i think that 's probably something that w it 's best if we take away with us , industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer : i think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um i think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . project manager : something something new . marketing : yeah , i was looking at the website , and the other things that they 've made and i like put down some like inspirational words like that i got from looking at the pictures . so the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : and um so it 's something that is sleek and stylish but it 's still functional , you know ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : so i 'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they do n't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . industrial designer : alright . project manager : uh-huh . marketing : you know , so something heading towards that , so it 's not overly i mean i do n't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so i figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : okay . project manager : so perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer : marketing : something that 's a little less crowded than this , like i mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your tv , right ? project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but what do most people do ? project manager : yeah . marketing : they turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : there is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing : sometimes they play a movie . industrial designer : but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah . marketing : yeah , so project manager : yeah . marketing : there 's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager : so , no . marketing : maybe to do project manager : it could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : and then use the user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : so , if you 're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that 's fine project manager : marketing : and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . project manager : mm-hmm . excellent . marketing : 'cause like if you look at the train , it 's just very like , there 's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and i dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager : oh i have n't had a look yet , yep . marketing : um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too . project manager : mm-hmm . great . any other immediate thoughts before we move along ? industrial designer : mm . uh we can aim for i mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although i do n't think that um it 's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . um project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah but uh i mean e even though it has to be re original we should n't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer : yeah . a big learning curve , yeah . user interface : with l learning , yeah , yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah . so , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager : it 's like those fancy websites that you ca n't access industrial designer : yeah . user interface : hm-hmm . project manager : because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . um we 've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you 're you 'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you 're looking at the working design , industrial designer : alright . project manager : you 're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it 's the user requirements specification , marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : like you said at the start . okay ? thanks for that . user interface : okay . thank you . project manager : uh i 'll see you in half an hour . industrial designer : . user interface : see you . project manager : carry the laptops back again . do we need to unplug things ? probably ."
