    "answer": "the chair : seeing no further petitions to be presented , we 'll continue , and we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers . please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely . go ahead , mr. scheer . hon . andrew scheer ( leader of the opposition ) : it was revealed yesterday that this government 's policy was to ignore fraud . the prime minister 's reaction was to act as if everything was normal . in fact , we 've learned that over 200,000cases of suspected fraud have been identified in the benefit applications . the prime minister is failing our future generations . our children and grandchildren are going to pay back billions of dollars that he 's borrowing to pay tax cheats . will the prime minister protect taxpayers and immediately begin a review of these 200,000cases of suspected fraud ? right hon . justin trudeau ( prime minister ) : our priority was to get money out quickly to all canadians who needed it , and that 's exactly what we 've done . millions of canadians have received the money they so desperately needed . having said that , i want to make it very clear , mr.chair : fraud is unacceptable . we have measures in place to detect fraud . all fraudsters will be required to pay back the money they fraudulently received from the government . we 're going to make sure that this is done in the coming months . hon . andrew scheer : mr . chair , conservatives agree that those who need help should get it , and no one is arguing that they should n't , but reports indicate that the liberals have ordered public servants to turn a blind eye to 200,000 cases of suspected fraud . it 's a simple question : yes or no , did the government instruct any government department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr . chair , the priority in this situation was getting money out to the millions of canadians who needed it as quickly as possible , but of course fraud is unacceptable . that 's why we have put safeguards in place to ensure that anyone who received that money fraudulently will have to repay it ."
