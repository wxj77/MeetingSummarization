    "answer": "hefin david am : so , what about risk appetite ? do you feel that any governing bodies are exhibiting what might be considered to be an imprudent risk appetite ? dr david blaney : i do n't think so , and this manifests itself in two ways . so , we would see this coming through in forecasts , and we would see it coming through in requests for borrowings , predominantly . actually , we 'd see it in other ways as well . our links into institutions are many and various , and we have our formal stuff , but we all have links into institutions that are informal and we\u2014 . one of the beauties of the scale of the sector in wales is we can see the institutions in a way that they ca n't hope to in england . it 's just completely different . and so we would see it in other ways . but we have , in some instances , i think it 's fair to say , helped institutions to think again about some of their aspirations . so , where we 've seen things and we think , 'that just looks ridiculously optimistic , ' we 've just asked the questions . we do n't say , 'no , you ca n't do that , ' because they are autonomous , they make the decisions , but we try to make sure that they 're asking the right questions . hefin david am : so , would you see that governing bodies are falling short in doing that themselves , in that , where they become strategic decisions that require due diligence , are the governing bodies themselves presenting that challenge ? or the fact you 've just said that , does that suggest to us that , actually , they are falling short ?"
