    "answer": "industrial designer : what what would be on that touch screen ? 'cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um marketing : and oh . industrial designer : logo or something or motto , i ca n't remember exactly what you said . marketing : yeah the the fashion user interface : we put fashion into electronics . marketing : do . yeah . project manager : w it 's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you 'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . marketing : right , and then you 're dealing with ports and cords and project manager : yeah i think perhaps industrial designer : 's too much . project manager : good idea but yeah marketing : yeah . project manager : i think that that one m might just be um and they just yeah i think that one might just be out of the range for this particular marketing : for now . project manager : a p_d_a_ would they would makes a lot of sense for a p_d_a_ 'cause you 're gon na be using it to connect up to things anyway but i dunno , what do you guys think ? industrial designer : think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . marketing : yeah . nice . industrial designer : that 'd be okay . user interface : yeah . uh i i 'm i 'm in agreement with that , i 'm wondering how we 're gon na get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device . marketing : um . well but if we 're gon na use a touch screen where it 's gon na come on like on your cell phone it 'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it 's loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary comes on every time you turn it on and then that 's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something i think . industrial designer : mm . true . user interface : project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : i 'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . marketing : yeah . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : y project manager : yeah . yeah i know i d it seems like it would suffice to have just the r_r_ on there . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah you would think . project manager : but apparently not . industrial designer : people are n't gon na want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . marketing : if it comes from above . user interface : industrial designer : they just want it to be on and ready to go . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . project manager : well fair enough . um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . but then again who wants to turn on a remote control . kind of if i user interface : well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . project manager : to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode . user interface : yep . goes into a sleep mode ."
