    "answer": "hefin david am : cabinet secretary , are you in favour of more university mergers ? kirsty williams am : i would n't use the word 'agnostic ' , but what i 'm in favour of is a healthy , strong and sustainable he sector . if individual institutions wish to collaborate or , indeed , go further to a formal merger then , obviously , that is a matter for them . we 're not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers , but , if individual institutions feel that is of benefit to them and their students , obviously , we would have an interest in that and making sure that they were robust plans , but that 's a matter for individual institutions . hefin david am : but hefcw are pushing it . kirsty williams am : well , again , what hefcw are interested in is a sustainable he sector that is strong but , as i said , i do not have a burning desire or a set policy to try and pursue mergers . hefin david am : okay . that 's a little bit of a contrast with your predecessors , then . kirsty williams am : well , that 's a matter for them . hefin david am : okay . the reason i say it is because i was kind of on the inside when cardiff metropolitan university was under pressure from the then minister to merge with the university of glamorgan and newport . it was a very difficult time for staff and , indeed , for students . you had the university and college union and the minister pushing it ; the vice-chancellor of cardiff met at the time very much against it . so , do you think that it 's really\u2014 ? you 're agnostic , but do you think perhaps it 's not worth the disruption that can occur to staff and students ? kirsty williams am : as i said , hefin , i have no formal policy for reconfiguration or mergers . that 's not to say i do n't believe in collaboration between institutions . going back to the issue of ite , a very interesting programme came forward from cardiff met and cardiff university for their ite provision . so , i 'm all for universities and institutions working together , but there 's no formal policy . these are autonomous institutions . if they see that there is an advantage\u2014i would hope for the student first , and , if we put the student at the front of this process , then we would obviously have an interest in that and making sure that that was the right thing to do . but , certainly , there is no pressure from us as a government to pursue an agenda of mergers . hefin david am : just to be clear , then , that 's likely to be a policy for the foreseeable future as well ; you 're not going to change that view . kirsty williams am : i have no intentions at this stage , but 'events , dear boy ' . [ laughter . ] you know , sometimes there may be a situation that i can not foresee at this moment that would necessitate , for the benefit of students , the benefit of wales , a merger . so , never say never , but , at this point in time , i do not foresee us changing that policy . lynne neagle am : julie on this . julie morgan am : yes , just looking back at that time , which i remember very vividly\u2014 hefin david am : so do i . julie morgan am : i had many meetings with cardiff met . do you feel there has been any disadvantage to cardiff met because that merger did n't go ahead ? kirsty williams am : i , personally , am not aware of any disadvantage to cardiff met , but i would recognise\u2014i would absolutely recognise\u2014for staff and students caught up in those deliberations and those issues , then that would have had a personal impact on them . in terms of the institution going forward , i 'm not aware that they are currently struggling with any disadvantage from that discussion . and , as i said , i 'm really heartened by some of the really interesting collaborative work that cardiff met are interested in doing , and new partnerships and new collaborations between institutions , whether that be cardiff uni or local colleges , and i think that 's to be welcomed . julie morgan am : so , following on from what hefin said , was it worth all the fuss ?"
