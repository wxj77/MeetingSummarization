    "query": "<s> what did kirsty williams say about the trend of teacher recruiting , the reasons for it , and the steps they had taken ?",
    "answer": "kirsty williams am : thank you , suzy . i think , for this year 's intake , although we 're in touch with our providers , we 're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year 's intake for a couple of months . but what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets . so , there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs . so , what we 're doing is first of all making sure that our ite provision is world class , so that , actually , welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher . you 'll be aware that we 've recently been through an accreditation process for new ite provision that will start in the next academic year . we have looked at financial incentives . it 's not the whole answer , i think , to these issues , but it 's part of a mixture of things that we need to do . you 'll be aware that , for priority subjects , with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications , those financial incentives are now \u00a320,000 a year . we 're also embarking on our first ever national ite recruitment marketing exercise . we have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees , e-mailing them , sending them materials to ask them to consider ( 1 ) becoming a teacher , and ( 2 ) crucially coming to do that training here in wales . we are now part of a full national programme of ite recruitment , giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher . so , there 's a whole package of things we need to do . in january of this year i set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff , and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next . suzy davies am : thank you for that answer . i can see there 's a lot of activity , but what exactly is it responding to ? presumably , some research has been done about why people do n't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers . i ca n't believe it 's just about ite , although this is very valuable , what you 're talking about . is there something that 's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching is n't a profession they want to go into ? is that something that 's happening just in wales or is it happening elsewhere as well ?"
