    "answer": "user interface : for personal preferences i think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . project manager : industrial designer : marketing : user interface : it 's a really good style , it going to be look like like this . it is unbreakable and it is very universal . w we 'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : and we can put all the options into this screen . we 'll need only few buttons . all the other things can be controlled through the screen . and all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . so press i would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium i think , and uh what else ? i got just very few and good ideas . we need power and volume . and let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . when you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the tv , project manager : it 's off . it 's on . user interface : the tv turns on . marketing : and when does it turn off ? user interface : when you do n't touch the control but you go out of the for for enough time marketing : oh so you have a user interface : like uh you marketing : sensing sensor machine that uh knows user interface : it 's a question to our technical design , our two engineers . industrial designer : project manager : marketing : tech user interface : and another nice feature that i would like to implement is uh volume control . suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . project manager : or you want to go to the kitchen . user interface : it 's easy to do , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : you just control the marketing : according to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . industrial designer : distance . user interface : according to the distance . yeah yeah yeah . so marketing : uh i 'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? uh is it a touch screen by the way ? user interface : i think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : so it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . user interface : so , its main purpose in fact is a back light , industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : which change colours , marketing : okay . user interface : which makes it easier to find , and each can it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ? marketing : okay ."
