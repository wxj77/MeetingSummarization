    "query": "<s> what did albert heaney think of the coronavirus act when discussing the evaluations on the legitimacy of the children 's rights , protection and demands ?",
    "answer": "albert heaney : thank you . thank you , chair , and i think nicola indicated before me , so apologies , nicola . just to say for the committee , really importantly , that we have n't introduced any easements in relation to children 's services legislation . i think that 's really quite crucial . so , from a welsh context , the standards that are in place do remain , so therefore there would n't have been a necessity for us to do a children 's rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation . i think that 's particularly a strong point to us in wales , both in terms of safeguarding arrangements , but also ensuring that children 's rights are protected at a crucial time . lynne neagle am : thank you . nicola . nicola edwards : thanks . in terms of childcare and education , we 're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements , and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those . obviously , the coronavirus act itself was uk government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments , but , in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space\u2014and i think albert was just saying the same thing\u2014we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward . suzy davies am : okay . well , just to come back on that then , are you saying to me that , as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we 've had , no assessments for children 's needs have been postponed , cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person ? julie morgan am : well , i think , as albert said , that there was no relaxation of regulation for children 's social care . you know , that's\u2014there have n't been any in wales . suzy davies am : no , but that 's what\u2014 . there 's no relaxation , but what 's happening in practice ? we 're down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectors\u2014who 's doing the children 's needs assessments , particularly for young carers ? julie morgan am : well , i\u2014 . albert , can you answer that ?"
