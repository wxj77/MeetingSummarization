    "query": "<s> how did huw irranca-davies ensure the high qualification and quality of the workforce while the rates remained at \u00a34.50 ?",
    "answer": "john griffiths am : yes , certainly , chair . in terms of child development and how this fits with wider welsh government strategy , huw , i 'd be interested in what you 'd have to say about the quality of childcare . we 're talking a lot about quantity , but obviously we want to up quality , and that 's recognised by welsh government . they 've talked about increasing the qualifications within the workforce , and the quality . i just wonder how that sits within the \u00a34.50 , because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there , and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place . huw irranca-davies am : john , you 're absolutely right , and two things on that : i visited one of the facilities in the valleys the other day that was taking this forward\u2014a very good independent sector-run childcare provision , with welsh language and english language running alongside each other , and i asked the point about the integration , curiously , but what they were doing was\u2014 . their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we 'd want to see : not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects\u2014 . so , it was hard to differentiate , in some ways , what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding , and including the nutritional stuff and all of that . now , that is the model we need to see , and the \u00a34.50 seems to work , at the moment , for that . it 'll be interesting , as we discussed previously , as it goes forward\u2014 . we need to look at whether that works , going forward . but the quality , i think , is key , and that 's why we 're focused very much on registered inspected providers , as opposed to every tom , dick and harriet . john griffiths am : if we want to increase salary levels , though , which i think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality , then obviously that might impact on the \u00a34.50 rate ."
