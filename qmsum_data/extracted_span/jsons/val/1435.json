people are right handed or left handed so y because i am left handed i use like this , say if you 're right handed you use like this marketing : yeah , for instance , mm . user interface : mm-hmm , mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . mm mm mm . industrial designer : or so tha your switch on and off should be on project manager : so adaptable yeah something user interface : adaptable . alright , good , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : maybe , if if it 's possible , yeah . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm user interface : so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? on off ? industrial designer : maybe i think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : we can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if i 'm left-hander i use this switch to follow the main operations . user interface : i mean if it 's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a marketing : three buttons you mean ?

industrial designer : yeah . marketing : uh no . user interface : i usually just change channels . industrial designer : marketing : because i 'm only using three or four channels but industrial designer : yeah . but they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah , you can only have one bit . project manager : yeah . i change channel like this , m uh i want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah . industrial designer : dash . marketing : and then back to the one i was before , project manager : also we can be here marketing : so there 's whichever it was . user interface : uh-huh . industrial designer : yeah you can project manager : yeah , that would be cool . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : go back button is good . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . uh uh we had that in in other countries . user interface : i once had it . industrial designer : yeah yeah , the previous button is . project manager : mm yeah . marketing : yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh , okay . user interface : history . industrial designer : oh uh . project manager : marketing : then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions , project manager : industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that becomes more complex , project manager : industrial designer : marketing : but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls . industrial designer : yeah yeah , what the which channels the viewer project manager : mm-mm . marketing : yeah project manager : okay . marketing : maybe it 's a project manager : so i think we have full of idea ."
