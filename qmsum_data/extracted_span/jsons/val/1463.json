    "query": "<s> summarize the discussion about industrial components .",
    "answer": "industrial designer : yep . so we 're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we 'll use for energy , and the material and interface . for energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . first one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this r_s_a_ and then uh titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we 're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d lcd display . and we can use some , moving kind of thing . so , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . so this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors . and we also want to look at our remote control , so . still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we 're to in our twelve euros or around that . so we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . project manager : mm-hmm , okay . industrial designer : so uh we discussed an excuse me . so we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and so we would like to just use simple battery . and also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we ca n't use double-curved shapes . marketing : what is a double-curved shape ? industrial designer : like you can have two curves . marketing : uh-huh . industrial designer : uh it 's i think in manufacturing i guess it 's problematic . so , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it 's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to lcd marketing : industrial designer : which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it 's more expensive , user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition marketing : industrial designer : we want to reduce uh cost . project manager : um i want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . marketing : the cost . industrial designer : uh uh and also like in if you put a it 's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things project manager : okay . you m titanium it 's more uh industrial designer : and yeah . user interface : w we can use something like you know the whole body 's titanium but there are some rubber or i dunno some rubber parts like industrial designer : yeah . marketing : mm like this ? project manager : yes so mm user interface : to make it feel better and to you know industrial designer : like in cell phones recently project manager : uh-huh . user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : these you can with the rubber in four directions and marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay . industrial designer : yeah . but full assembly we 'll use mainly for titanium project manager : okay . industrial designer : rubber is expensive project manager : okay . industrial designer : and also it 's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . project manager : okay . industrial designer : and this push buttons project manager : uh yeah so industrial designer : we we would like to use push buttons instead of lcds and so we want to mo i mean we 're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money project manager : okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated . industrial designer : for s s marketing : speech industrial designer : y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : okay . user interface : okay , and still we have industrial designer : so user interface : mm can we still include the l_ l_s_d_ display ? marketing : lcd . user interface : lcd yeah lcd . marketing : seems not , it 's either lcd or push-button . industrial designer : it 's like a user interface : it 's not gon na be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus . industrial designer : yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we 'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and user interface : okay , so let 's try it , let 's t industrial designer : because the speech recognition technology will take at least five euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display marketing : the lcd would industrial designer : or this inter marketing : the display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . user interface : yeah , yeah , it 's it 's not gon na be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . marketing : just uh for output , yeah . industrial designer : ok yeah , that can we we can consider , marketing : yeah . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : because like it wo n't take much money i guess , user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : because project manager : okay . industrial designer : okay , yep . project manager : mm . industrial designer : you have any further questions or ? marketing : i guess no um . so the batteries uh are going to be very light . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , we 're to go for li and now i think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries marketing : okay . user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : for really light batteries and with uh good price . marketing : so this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask . industrial designer : yeah , that 's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . if we 're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology project manager : okay , industrial designer : and so project manager : for the location . hmm . industrial designer : yeah , if if everybody in the house n to locate then we 're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . marketing : okay . project manager : okay . so let 's now go to the you do n't have more question ? marketing : no , it 's okay . project manager : um mm thank you mm . user interface : no more questions . industrial designer : yep . thank you . marketing : puts less of constraint on what we can do project manager : yeah . user interface : mm yeah , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : it 's always like that . we have dreams and the in the end we find out that it 's not feasible . project manager : yeah , but mm . industrial designer : oh . we have uh some limitations . marketing : anyway . yeah . user interface : but still uh l_s_d_ 's already quite nice , marketing : lcd . project manager : okay . user interface : l_c_ marketing : l_s_d_ is something else , industrial designer : marketing : and it 's quite nice as well . user interface : i 'm an artist , sorry . project manager : um yeah . user interface : so uh , that 's not marketing : go on uh artist ."
