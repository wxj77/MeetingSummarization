    "answer": "the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ( simcoe north , cpc ) ) : the honourable minister of industry . hon . navdeep bains : mr . chair , i 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question . i want to highlight the fact that we did make an amendment . when we originally proposed this initiative , the threshold was 30 % for the month of march . now businesses will only need to show a 15 % decline in revenue , and businesses will have the option of using january and february as a reference period to show revenue losses , or of using the same time last year . this reflects , again , our ability to understand the needs of businesses , to act quickly and to make sure that they benefit from this very important initiative . mr. larry maguire : they still do n't qualify , mr . chair . the blarney stone restaurant in killarney has repeatedly asked the minister of finance if they could refinance their loans through the canada small business financing program . will the minister of finance give small business owners the ability to refinance their existing loans through the program , yes or no ? hon . navdeep bains : mr . chair , again , we 've demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness when it comes to these financing options . i 'd also like to highlight another very important initiative that was mentioned earlier , the deferring of gst/hst and customs duty payments for businesses for the next three months . this will help 3.2 million business owners and entrepreneurs across the country . again , it 's another initiative to put more money in the pockets of businesses as they deal with this unprecedented health care crisis ."
