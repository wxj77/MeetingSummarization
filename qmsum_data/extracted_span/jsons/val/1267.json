    "query": "<s> what did the prime minister say about students ?",
    "answer": "the chair : mr.blanchet now has the floor . mr. yves-franois blanchet ( beloeilchambly , bq ) : thank you very much , mr.chair . on friday , students in quebec and canada will be able to apply for the canada emergency student benefit , which is a good thing . this program was necessary , particularly because the number of students who wo n't be able to get back their jobs from last year is much higher than the number of jobs that might be available to these young people . there are also issues of duration . we do n't know how long these jobs will remain unavailable . people talked about a risk to being in the labour market and meeting the needs of the labour market . on april29 , the deputy prime minister made a formal commitment to ensure that these programs are accompanied by work incentives for youth and all cesb recipients . so that everyone knows what they 're getting into , i 'd like to know whether the employment incentives that will accompany the canada emergency response benefit will be known by friday . right hon . justin trudeau : i thank the hon . member for understanding the importance of supporting students who , for the most part , wo n't be able to get the summer jobs they were counting on . young people do n't just want to earn money ; they also want to gain work experience . that 's why we 're setting up programs , including canada summer jobs , but also another program with 76,000new jobs for young people in important sectors , so that young people can also get jobs . we will continue to work with youth and employers to ensure that gaps in the labour market are addressed , while ensuring that youth are well-supported . mr. yves-franois blanchet : that 's very interesting , but it does n't answer my question at all . people in the fishing , tourism and agricultural sectors , as well as municipalities and , from the very beginning , of course , the government of quebec , more generally , have expressed fears that job gains will cause people to lose their benefits and discourage them from going to work . the only way to avoid that is to ensure that people keep more money as they work more . that is the principle . in fact , we propose that over the $ 1,000no-penalty limit , half of the earnings be exempt from penalty . is this something that could be considered ? since it 's been two weeks since the commitment was made and it 's urgent , can we act now ? the emergency should n't last eight months . right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , young people need money , but they also need work experience . this is an unprecedented situation , which is why we 're working with seasonal industries and the different regions to make sure they have a sufficient workforce in their situation . students can be part of it , but at the same time we must provide the necessary support for those who ca n't find a job . that 's why we continue to work with the industries involved to ensure that they have a sufficient workforce while we support students ."
