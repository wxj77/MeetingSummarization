    "answer": "mrs. cathy mcleod ( kamloopsthompsoncariboo , cpc ) : thank you , mr . chair . senior canadian bureaucrats received very credible reports in early january that china was procuring and hoarding ppe . as a member of cabinet , was the health minister aware ? hon . patty hajdu ( minister of health ) : mr . chair , from the very beginning of the outbreak in early january we were aware of the challenges our health sector would face , and we immediately began to work with the provinces and territories to understand what the need would be and how we could best prepare . mrs. cathy mcleod : in april , the minister stated there were not enough supplies in the national emergency stockpile . can she explain why she approved a donation of 16 tonnes of ppe for china on january 31 , claiming it would not compromise our supply ? she ca n't have it both ways . we do n't have enough ; we have enough and it wo n't compromise it . hon . anita anand ( minister of public services and procurement ) : mr . chair , we are operating in a highly competitive global environment , and the reality is that we need to make sure we have multiple complementary supply chains operating at the same time , which we have been doing in the past weeks and months , to ensure our front-line health care workers have the supplies they need to keep canadians safe . that 's our priority . that 's what we 're working on . mrs. cathy mcleod : unfortunately , this question was directed to the health minister , referencing things she actually stated in terms of the availability of our supplies . before the she signed off on the donationand it was the health minister who signed off on the donationdid she consult with the health ministers in the provinces and territories ? hon . patty hajdu : mr . chair , as the member opposite knows , provinces and territories have their own stockpiles , which of course they use to prepare for incidences of outbreak and other illnesses across their jurisdictions . we 've worked very closely with the provinces and territories since the beginning of the outbreak to make sure we can provide any particular additional support . in fact , of all the requests made so far , we have been able to complete them . mrs. cathy mcleod : health care workers are now having to look at modified full-face snorkels as an alternative to n95 masks . did it not occur to the minister that our hospitals and care homes could have used that ppe she shipped out , providing a longer opportunity for them to also get procurement done ? hon . patty hajdu : mr . chair , as the member opposite knows , the equipment that was donated when china was in its outbreak was an important donation of nearly expired or expired goods that it was in desperate need of in its effort to try to contain the virus . as the member opposite knows , we 've been able to work successfully with provinces and territories to ensure they have what they need . mrs. cathy mcleod : mr . chair , i would suggest that during february and march our hospitals would have consumed that almost-expired product very efficiently , but i want to move on to another topic . when defending the sale of 22 seniors ' homes to the chinese government , the prime minister stated that we have a strong regulatory regime that imposes rigorous standards . he said that this regime ensures the care our seniors get is top quality . that was in 2017 . now he states he is saddened , shocked , disappointed and angered . was the prime minister completely oblivious to the risks , or was he just too anxious to please the chinese government when he sold those 22 homes ? hon . patty hajdu : mr . chair , the homes the member opposite is referring to are in the province of b.c. , and i have to commend the province for the early work it did to protect seniors in those long-term care homes . the member opposite is trying to confuse the issue . as she knows , the review we did was entirely separate from the standards to which the province holds the care homes . mrs. cathy mcleod : the prime minister does not have authority over seniors ' homes , which he has clearly stated , but he does have authority over the act in which he approved the sale . at 18 months , government had an obligation to make sure there was compliance . was that done ? hon . patty hajdu : mr . chair , the long-term care homes in each province fall within the jurisdiction of their own particular act , and those provinces and territories are responsible for fulfilling the inspections required under that act . mrs. cathy mcleod : under the investment canada act , the government is obligated to review the sale for compliance . four homes had to close . since the government approved the sale , it is complicit in the care of our seniors in this country"
