    "answer": "lynne neagle am : okay . thank you very much . and the next questions , then , are from suzy davies . suzy davies am : thank you , chair . i just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the minister , i think , about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed , about which children 's rights impact assessments have been done . have any been done , and can they be shared with the committee if they have ? sorry , deputy minister\u2014my mistake . julie morgan am : well , it 's been a very difficult time , as you appreciate , in terms of having to make legislation very quickly , and it has n't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do . however , i am very pleased to say that we 're actually launching a survey of children . we 're going to be launching it next week . and this is to try to get from children their views of what 's happened , what we 've been doing , and their views on the whole covid-19 situation . so , we 're doing this in conjunction with the children 's commissioner and with young wales and with the youth parliament . so , this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children , and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them , what they feel about what 's happened during this period , what they feel about the way that we 've dealt with the schools , the way that they 've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long . and so we 're trying to get feedback from young people . so , i 'm very pleased that we 're doing that , but , in terms of an impact assessment , it has been very difficult , as i 'm sure you can imagine , to be able to do those at these times . i think that albert wants to come in on that . suzy davies am : yes , because i 'll pursue that in a sec . lynne neagle am : albert . albert heaney : thank you . thank you , chair , and i think nicola indicated before me , so apologies , nicola . just to say for the committee , really importantly , that we have n't introduced any easements in relation to children 's services legislation . i think that 's really quite crucial . so , from a welsh context , the standards that are in place do remain , so therefore there would n't have been a necessity for us to do a children 's rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation . i think that 's particularly a strong point to us in wales , both in terms of safeguarding arrangements , but also ensuring that children 's rights are protected at a crucial time . lynne neagle am : thank you . nicola . nicola edwards : thanks . in terms of childcare and education , we 're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements , and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those . obviously , the coronavirus act itself was uk government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments , but , in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space\u2014and i think albert was just saying the same thing\u2014we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward . suzy davies am : okay . well , just to come back on that then , are you saying to me that , as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we 've had , no assessments for children 's needs have been postponed , cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person ? julie morgan am : well , i think , as albert said , that there was no relaxation of regulation for children 's social care . you know , that's\u2014there have n't been any in wales . suzy davies am : no , but that 's what\u2014 . there 's no relaxation , but what 's happening in practice ? we 're down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectors\u2014who 's doing the children 's needs assessments , particularly for young carers ? julie morgan am : well , i\u2014 . albert , can you answer that ? albert heaney : i think the first thing to say to the committee is that , going back , we took a very strong line at the beginning that we were n't going to introduce easements in requirements to children 's social services . of course , through the way that practitioners and social work practitioners have to operate , they are having to operate through a different time . so , assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns ; assessments are still taking place , and especially in relation to\u2014as you mentioned\u2014young carers , to support their needs . so , arrangements\u2014 [ inaudible . ] but they 're having to be slightly differently done\u2014so , some of the technology , and keeping in contact and keeping those visits . so , we 've used , for example , the st david 's day fund to make sure that care leavers are well supported in terms of having contact and are accessible and able to engage as well . so , we 're having to be a little bit more\u2014and social services departments are having to be a little bit more\u2014innovative in the use of technology in the way that they 've engaged as well . but personal visits are taking place , and visits especially , as the minister mentioned earlier on\u2014they actually individually assess each case to determine the frequency of visits , to make sure that those contacts are maintained with children at a critical time . suzy davies am : okay . thank you . i do n't want to take this much further , but personal visits and social distancing could be slightly problematic . i just want to finish with this one question , if i may . we 've had recommendations from the carers trust , or carers trust wales . have they been accepted by government , and is it those that are driving the agenda of the task and finish group that you announced the other day , deputy minister ? julie morgan am : well , those will certainly be considered by the task and finish group . i 've had a letter from the carers trust about those issues , and we are setting up this group , as you know , and we will be looking at those issues in the group . suzy davies am : okay . thank you . any steal on when that might report ? julie morgan am : i do n't have that at the moment . suzy davies am : okay . thank you . lynne neagle am : maybe we could have a note on that , deputy minister . can i just say , we are running short of time ? we did start late , so , if the ministers are happy , we 'll carry on until 2.10 p.m.\u20143.10 p.m.\u2014if that 's okay . and the next questions are from si\u00e2n gwenllian . sian gwenllian am : [ inaudible . ] lynne neagle am : hold on a sec , si\u00e2n , we 've lost translation again . can we just see what can be done to get the translation back ? sorry , si\u00e2n . is there anyone who can help with the translation ? there you go , si\u00e2n . thank you . sian gwenllian am : you will know , deputy minister\u2014because we have discussed this in private session\u2014my major concerns with regard to the childcare sector , and what kind of childcare sector we will have at the end of this crisis , as families start to return to the workplace . there are still some childcare providers who are falling between the cracks and are n't receiving financial support . do you agree\u2014are there people who are still not being supported , and why is n't the welsh government able to provide that support for everyone in the childcare sector ?"
