(CNN) -- Travelers heading for Mumbai were urged to postpone their journeys Thursday amid fears that foreigners could be targeted following Wednesday's terror attacks that left more than 100 people dead and two luxury hotels under siege.

Indian reserve soldiers keep vigil outside the residence of the Indian Prime Minister on Thursday.

At least six foreigners were reported dead in the attacks including Italian and British nationals.

The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi said the situation in Mumbai remained fluid and warned those planning to travel to Mumbai to postpone their journeys for at least the next 48 to 72 hours.

"U.S. citizens who have immediate travel plans and have lost or damaged passports can come directly to the Consulate to obtain an emergency replacement passport," a statement said.

The UK's Foreign Office advised against "all but essential travel to Mumbai until further notice."

"We have said to the people of Mumbai they should avoid going out and about more than they need to for the time being. And those planning to visit Mumbai should only do so if they have essential business to do. That is roughly in line with the advice the government has given, that today is not the day to go to Mumbai," Richard Stagg, the British High Commissioner to London, told CNN-IBN.
