LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The son of actor Michael Landon was found dead in his West Hollywood, California, home Monday afternoon, according to investigators.

There was "no indication of foul play" in the death of Mark Landon, 60, according to the report from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

Mark Landon was the son of Dodie Frasier, who married Michael Landon in 1956. The actor adopted the child and his younger brother.

Mark Landon had a few acting credits, playing small roles in three movies, according to the Internet Movie Database.

He played a cab driver in "Us," a film his father directed and starred in just before his death from cancer in 1991.

Michael Landon was once one of Hollywood's biggest TV stars. He is best known for his 14 years as "Little Joe" Cartwright in TV's long-running "Bonanza," and later as Charles Ingalls in nine seasons of "Little House on the Prairie."

CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.
