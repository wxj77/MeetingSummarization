(CNN) -- Juventus returned to the top of Italy's Serie A on goal difference on Monday after coming from behind to draw 1-1 at Roma, whose captain Francesco Totti missed a penalty.

The Turin club joined Udinese on 30 points after 14 rounds and remained unbeaten in the league this season thanks to a second-half equalizer from defender Giorgio Chiellini.

Daniele de Rossi, playing as a makeshift central defender, gave mid-table Roma the lead at the Stadio Olympico in the fifth minute.

The Italy international midfielder mistimed his volley from Totti's short-corner, but Arturo Vidal miskicked as he tried to prevent the ball crossing the line.

However, the Chilean was involved in the build-up as Juve drew level on the hour, with Chiellini beating De Rossi and Gabriel Heinze to a loose effort by Paraguayan winger Marcelo Estigarribia and heading home.

Totti, returning to the starting line-up with Bojan Krkic suspended, had the chance to win the match for Roma soon after when Vidal fouled Erik Lamela.

However, Juve goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon comfortably saved his former international teammate's 63rd-minute penalty.

The draw left Roma in ninth place, one of four clubs on 18 points.

Juve, having the team's best run of results since being stripped of the scudetto and relegated to Serie B in 2006's match-fixing scandal, are still on course for a first Serie A title in nine seasons and 28th overall.
