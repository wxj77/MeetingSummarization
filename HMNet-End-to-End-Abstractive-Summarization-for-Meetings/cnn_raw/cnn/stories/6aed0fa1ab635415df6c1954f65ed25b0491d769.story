(CNN)  -- World champion Jorge Lorenzo triumphed in his home MotoGP on Sunday after an incident-packed race at Jerez.

It was a Spanish one-two with Dani Pedrosa finishing second for Honda with Ducati's Nicky Hayden completing the podium.

But it proved a heartbreaking afternoon for Italy's Marco Simoncelli, who looked to be headed for his maiden MotoGP win on his Honda before sliding off in wet conditions when leading Lorenzo by three seconds.

Pole sitter Casey Stoner, who won the opening round in Qatar, did not finish in a chaotic race as he fell victim to a mistake by his arch-rival Valentino Rossi, who started from 12th before joining the leading group.

But the Ducati star, who had overtaken former teammate Lorenzo, tried to pass Stoner, but as he overtook on the inside he lost control of his bike, sending both of them off.

"Rossi came up the inside and wasn't able to stay on the bike and took me out," Stoner told the official MotoGP website.

"It was not the best day for us for sure, after such a good weekend. We're very disappointed with this result."

Rossi was able to restart his bike, but Aussie Stoner was not so lucky and missed out on the points with Lorenzo taking over at the top of the standings after two rounds from Pedrosa.

Rossi eventually finished fifth, taking advantage of spills for compatriot Simoncelli and American Ben Spies, who had passed Pedrosa for second but then ended in the gravel, losing 20 points.

Colin Edwards was also set for the podium, but also went off to allow former world champion Hayden and fellow American Hayden the chance to claim that honor for Ducati for the first time.

In the Moto2 category, Italian Andrea Iannone rode his Suter to victory with Swiss Thomas Luthi, also on a Suter, second and Italian Simone Corsi (FTR) third.

Spaniard Nicolas Terol won on his Aprilia in the 125cc category.
