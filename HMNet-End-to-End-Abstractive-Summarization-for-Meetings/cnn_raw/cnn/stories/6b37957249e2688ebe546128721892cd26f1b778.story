(CNN)While Disneyland has long been known as the "happiest place on Earth," Disney's cruise ships sound like they're also pretty cheerful spots to vacation.

At least that's what the 2015 Cruise Critic Cruisers' Choice Awards, announced Monday, are indicating. Disney Cruise Line dominated this year's awards, winning in 12 categories.

Disney Cruise Line won the coveted "best overall" cruise line award for the third year in a row. The Disney Dream ship won in the large ship category, and Disney Wonder won in the midsize category.

Other Disney awards include Disney Dream's wins for "best entertainment" and "best cruises to the Bahamas" and Disney Fantasy's wins for "best cabins," "best service" and "best for families."

The awards are based on consumer reviews by members of the Cruise Critic website.

"Cruise Critic's community of cruisers is the largest in the world, so to be named to this list is truly an honor," said Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic. "Of the thousands of reviews we received in 2014, these ships represent the best-of-the-best, qualified by travelers who have sailed firsthand and shared their experiences once they returned."

Oceania Riviera won four awards, including "best dining" and "best cabins" in the midsize category for the second year in a row, taking note of the variety of fine dining options, Culinary Center and elegant cabin furnishings.

Carnival Liberty was named "best value for money" in the large ship category for the second consecutive year.

The awards are bestowed in three ship categories, based on passenger capacity. Large ships carry 2,000 or more passengers. Midsize ships carry 1,200 to 1,999 passengers. Small ships carry fewer than 1,200. Awards are calculated using Cruise Critic member ratings.
