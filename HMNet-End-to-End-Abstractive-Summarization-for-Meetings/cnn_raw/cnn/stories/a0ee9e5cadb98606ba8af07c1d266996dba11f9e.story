(CNN) -- Michiganders looking for work might want to keep their eyes peeled for Superman.

Zack Snyder's upcoming "Man of Steel" sequel, which will star Brit actor Henry Cavill as Superman and Ben Affleck as Batman, is slated to film in metro Detroit and throughout Michigan, the Michigan Film Office announced Thursday.

The Warner Bros. production has earned a $35 million incentive for the $131 million it's projected to rack up in in-state expenses. It's also expected that the upcoming release will hire just over 400 workers, and create the equivalent of 426 full-time jobs. (A bit of good news to follow a dreary summer -- in July, Detroit became America's largest city to declare bankruptcy.)

In the eyes of director Snyder, Detroit "is a great example of a quintessential American city, and I know it will make the perfect backdrop for our movie," he said in a statement. "Detroit and the entire state of Michigan have been fantastic collaborators, and we are looking forward to working together on this film."

Snyder also helmed this summer's "Man of Steel," which rebooted the Superman story and reimagined him as a hero who's capable of making devastating, controversial choices.

The sequel, scheduled to premiere in July 2015, will put Clark Kent and the Caped Crusader on the big screen together for the first time. David S. Goyer, who wrote the first "Man of Steel" script, is also handling the sequel's screenplay.

In addition to Cavill and Affleck -- much, by the way, to the Internet's chagrin -- the sequel will also star Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White and Diane Lane as Martha Kent.

Snyder strongly hinted this summer that Batman and Superman will be rivals in this installment. "It's beyond mythological to have Superman and our new Batman facing off, since they are the greatest superheroes in the world," he said.

Production is expected to kick off during the first quarter of 2014.
