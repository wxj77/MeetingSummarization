Darrell Hammond will be the new Don Pardo.

Hammond, the former "Saturday Night Live" cast member, is returning to the show that made him famous in a new position -- that of announcer. He takes over from Don Pardo, who died in August. NBC announced Hammond's hiring in a press release.

Hammond spent 14 seasons on the late-night show in the 1990s and 2000s, the longest run of any "SNL" cast member. He was best known for his impressions, including versions of Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Regis Philbin and Sean Connery.

Since leaving the show in 2009, Hammond has returned for several cameos. He's also appeared on such TV shows as "Damages" and movies such as "Scary Movie 5." He published a memoir, "God, If You're Not Up There, I'm F*cked," in 2011.

The 40th season of "Saturday Night Live" premieres on September 27. Chris Pratt is scheduled to host.
