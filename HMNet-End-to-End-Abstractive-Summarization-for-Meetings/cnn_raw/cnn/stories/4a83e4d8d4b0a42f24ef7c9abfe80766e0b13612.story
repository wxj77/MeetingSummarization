(CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor is hospitalized again and will have part of a leg amputated, according to her representative.

John Blanchette said cancerous lesions started appearing on one of Gabor's legs, which were examined Sunday, and gangrene was imminent. Gabor was being prepared for surgery Sunday night. Her leg will be amputated below the knee, Blanchette said.

Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, is with her in the hospital, Blanchette said.

In November, Gabor was hospitalized for a swollen leg, her husband said at the time.

Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, according to Von Anhalt.

Gabor has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt has said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.

The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders.

Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, "Moulin Rouge"; "The Story of Three Loves" in 1953; "The Girl in the Kremlin" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, "Touch of Evil."
