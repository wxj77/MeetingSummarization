(CNN) -- La Liga leaders Barcelona needed a late goal from David Villa on Saturday to rescue a 1-1 draw away at Sporting Gijon.

Josep Guardiola's side had been on a record-breaking 16-match winning streak prior to their stalemate at El Molinon stadium.

The reigning Spanish champions fell behind on 15 minutes thanks to a superb solo-strike from Sporting's David Barral.

Barral, 27, slipped past Gerard Pique before he cut inside Diego Milito and fired a low shot across Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes and into the corner of the net.

Barcelona trailed until the 80th minute, when Argentina's Lionel Messi released striker Villa.

The Spanish World Cup winner saw Sporting goalkeeper Ivan Cuellar off his line and executed a delicate chip from 20 yards out which sailed into the goal.

The result means second placed Real Madrid are now eight points behind Barcelona with one game in hand.

Jose Mourinho's Real travel to Barcelona to face Espanyol on Sunday.

Valencia moved into third place in La Liga with a 2-1 defeat of Atletico Madrid at the Vicente Calderon Stadium.

Former Arsenal winger Jose Antonio Reyes put the home team ahead after only three minutes, but Spanish forward Joaquin leveled for Los Che just before halftime.

With four minutes remaining, Joaquin struck his second goal of the match to hand Unai Emery's team the three points.

The results lift Valencia above Villarreal, who face Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday.

In Italy, Serie A leaders AC Milan returned to winning ways on Saturday with a resounding 4-0 win over strugglers Parma.

Veteran Dutch midfield Clarence Seedorf opened the scoring after eight minutes, and the Rossoneri were firmly in control when January-signing Antonio Cassano doubled their lead nine minutes later.

On-loan Brazil forward Robinho made sure of the win for Massimiliano Allegri's team with two goals in the second half.

Before Saturday's clash at the San Siro, Milan had not won since a 2-0 victory over Catania on January 29.
