(CNN) -- Inter Milan are through to the semifinals of the Champions League after Wesley Sneijder's first-half free-kick gave them a 1-0 victory at CSKA Moscow, for a 2-0 aggregate win.

Dutchman Sneidjer scored the only goal of the game in the sixth minute when his low-free-kick deceived goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev after his defensive wall jumped in unison -- allowing the shot to go underneath them.

Following their 1-0 defeat at the San Siro last week, that meant the Russian champions needed to score three times to advance to the last four stage for the first time in their history.

But their mission became impossible three minutes after the interval when substitute Chidi Odiah was sent off for a late challenge on Samuel Eto'o, resulting in a second yellow card.

From then on, Italian champions Inter Milan were always in control.

Sneijder and Dejan Stankovic both had shots well saved by Akinfeev, while the goalkeeper produced a superb save to keep out Diego Milito when the Argentine international went through on goal.

The home side rarely threatened after being reduced to 10 men and Inter comfortably held on to reach the last four of the competition for the first time since 2003.
