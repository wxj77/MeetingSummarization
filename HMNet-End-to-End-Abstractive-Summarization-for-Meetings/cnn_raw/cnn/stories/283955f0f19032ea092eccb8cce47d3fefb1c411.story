(EW.com) -- Newsflash: '80s icon Molly Ringwald is still cool. Like, really cool.

"The Secret Life of the American Teenager" star just did an "Ask Me Anything" interview on social news site/intense Internet community Reddit, and by all accounts, it was a smashing success. Over the course of a few hours, Ringwald shared anecdotes from her John Hughes-directed heyday, proved she knows a thing or two about the site's unique memes, and poked fun at Woody Harrelson, whose own AMA interview went disastrously wrong this past February.

Ringwald doesn't have a project to promote; "Secret Life" is in the middle of its fourth season, and though she's working on a jazz album, it won't be released until next spring. Maybe that's why she was so loose and funny on Reddit. Here, for example, is how she responded when a user asked about her famous "Breakfast Club" lipstick trick:

"Regarding lipstick, it's all movie magic. There is a story behind that: John Hughes wrote it but never actually thought about me having to do it. He kept putting it off until the end of filming that long scene. I kept bringing it up, like, 'Hey. We gotta figure this out. Are we going to have robotic breasts?' Finally we decided it was better to see less and let everyone assume that I was particularly skilled."

Robotic breasts! When someone asked for details about a proposed "Sixteen Candles" sequel: "I don't remember much about it, but the script eventually became 'Avatar.'"

The best part of the interview, though, came when accioc asked, "How did you manage to get hotter with age?" Though I've already spoiled Ringwald's answer here, it's worth repeating anyway: "I drink the blood of Kristen Stewart." (Also worth noting is user cheryldad33â€²s response to Ringwald's response: "I had assumed that blood would be stale and lifeless.")

This, celebrities, is how you can convince the Internet's cynical denizens that you're more than an empty vessel: Do your research, don't be afraid to stray from talking points, and above all else, show off your personality. (Unless you're not funny in real life, I guess.)

Read Ringwald's full interview -- there's plenty more stuff about her '80s movies in there, as well as a truly great "American Psycho" reference -- then tell us: What's your favorite part of this AMA?

Oh, and P.S. -- Molly Ringwald is also on Twitter now. Just don't try to get her attention by tweeting, "What's happening, hot stuff?"
