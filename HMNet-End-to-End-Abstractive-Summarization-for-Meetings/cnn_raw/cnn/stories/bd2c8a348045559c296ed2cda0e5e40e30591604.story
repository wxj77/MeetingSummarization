(CNN) -- Andrea Agnelli will become the new president of Juventus at the end of the current season -- the Italian giants confirmed on their official Web site.

The 34-year-old, who will replace Jean-Claude Blanc in the position, continues in his family's long-standing links with the Turin-based club -- and comes 48 years after his father, Umberto, was president.

It is the second presidential change Juventus have made this season after Blanc replaced Giovanni Cobolli Gigli in October.

Blanc will revert to the position of chief executive when Agnelli takes over at the end of the season.

Agnelli told www.Juventus.It: "I think I can give an important contribution to the development of this club.

"It is a complicated route, which first and foremost will see the strengthening of the structure on all levels, both as a company and as a sports club.

"The history of my family is linked to this team and began 84 years ago. My father was president nearly 50 years ago,

"I do now want to make any comparisons with those times. We must think of tomorrow. I am proud to give my contribution."

Meanwhile, German Bundesliga strugglers Bochum have sacked coach Heiko Herrlich, who has paid the price for a run of 10 matches without a win.

Assistant coach Dariusz Wosz will take charge for the final two games of the season, starting with the dauting trip to Champions League finalists Bayern Munich on Saturday.
