(CNN Student News) -- August 26, 2013

Syria offers U.N. inspectors access to sites of suspected chemical weapons attacks, and a wildfire threatens both Yosemite National Park and city services in San Francisco. Get the details on both stories in Monday's program. Plus, thousands of Americans re-enact the 1963 March on Washington, and Bernice King talks about being the daughter of a civil rights leader. And we meet a CNN Hero who helps mentor teenage refugees.
