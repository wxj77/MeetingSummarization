(CNN) -- A Pakistani court hearing the retrial of a doctor accused of helping the United States find Osama bin Laden said Monday that it would announce its verdict on December 18.

The prosecution and defense completed their arguments in the case of Dr. Shakil Afridi before the Federally Administered Tribal Areas Tribunal. The court then set the date for delivering the verdict.

Afridi, a physician by profession, was accused of assisting the CIA in obtaining DNA samples of bin Laden through a fake vaccination campaign and was sentenced last year by a tribal court to 33 years in prison for involvement in anti-state activities.

Afridi appealed the conviction. A Pakistani judicial commissioner overturned the conviction in August and ordered a retrial.

U.S. special forces killed bin Laden at compound in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in May 2011.
