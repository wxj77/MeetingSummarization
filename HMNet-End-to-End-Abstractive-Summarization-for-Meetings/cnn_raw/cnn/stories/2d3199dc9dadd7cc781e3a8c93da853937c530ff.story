(CNN) -- Twitter is testing a major profile redesign that's very reminiscent of Facebook and Google+.

Mashable assistant features editor Matt Petronzio spotted on Tuesday a huge update to his Twitter profile page, with the main picture and bio scaled to the left and significantly more real estate dedicated to the header photo.

The revamped tweet stream is also a departure from its signature look. There is a greater focus on photos and content cards. It moves away from a strictly vertical timeline too. Click the image below to enlarge.

It's common for Twitter to quietly test new features and design updates before tweaking or rolling it out to a larger user base. Experiments typically go out to a small, random pool of users.

Under the header photo in the test is the count for tweets, photos/videos (a new category called out on the profile), who you are following, followers, favorites and lists. Although Petronzio isn't verified on the site, there's an option for the stream to show "Tweets" and "Tweets and replies" for every user â€” a feature typically reserved for those with the blue check mark.

Other profile pages viewed from an account with the new design are automatically made to look like this too. This means that even if your Twitter page isn't a part of the test, Petronzio can see what yours will look like.

The recommended header photo size in the test version is 1500 x 500 pixels, up from 1252 x 626 in the current design, so users with the new design will want to switch their picture so it doesn't look stretched.

The news comes days after Twitter rolled out its latest design to all users, after weeks of behind the scenes testing.

The company declined to comment on this story.
