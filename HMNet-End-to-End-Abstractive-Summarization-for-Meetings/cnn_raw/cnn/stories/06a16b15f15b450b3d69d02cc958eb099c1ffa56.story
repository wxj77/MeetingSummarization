(CNN) -- College football's top-ranked LSU Tigers defeated the No. 2 Alabama Crimson Tide 9-6 in overtime Saturday night.

LSU won the coin toss in overtime, electing to start on defense. The Crimson Tide's offense sputtered in the extra session with two incomplete passes, a penalty for having 12 men in the huddle and a sack for a 5-yard loss.

Cade Foster, Alabama's placekicker, who had already missed three field goals earlier, missed another from 52 yards out.

After that, LSU marched down the field, nearly scoring a touchdown but running back Michael Ford stepped out of bounds.

Big game a work of heart

LSU elected to attempt a field goal and Drew Alleman-- who kicked two field goals earlier -- hit the 25-yard game-winner.

The game, before a Bryant-Denny Stadium crowd in Tuscaloosa, mainly witnessed field goals and punts. Neither team scored a single touchdown.

The low score might be surprising, given that the teams totaled 45 points in 2010, 39 in 2009 and 48 in 2008.

The game was the first-ever SEC regular season game matching the country's two top teams, which were undefeated going into play.

Both teams were among the nation's best when it came to defense and Saturday's game was no exception with LSU notching a field goal in the last seconds for a 3-3 tie going into halftime. Alabama missed two field goals in the first half.

'Game of the century' decided by kickers

The defensive standoff continued in the second half.

Alabama went up 6-3 midway through the third quarter with a 46-yard field goal. LSU tied the game early in the fourth quarter with a 30-yard field goal.

Recap: No.1 LSU vs. No. 2 Alabama

Going into the game, LSU had outscored its opponent by 222 points this year, according to the school's athletics website.

The game, broadcast by CBS, was played under clear but cool skies.
