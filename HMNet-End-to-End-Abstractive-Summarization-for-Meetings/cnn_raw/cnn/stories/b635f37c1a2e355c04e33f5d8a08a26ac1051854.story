(CNN)  -- Bayern Munich came from a goal down to forge a 2-1 victory over Basel in Switzerland on Tuesday in their Champions League Group E clash.

Last season's runners-up were beaten by Mainz at the weekend in a setback to their Bundesliga title defense, but showed their mettle in Switzerland to secure a second successive win in the Champions League.

Alexander Frei put the home side ahead after 18 minutes with a fine strike before World Cup star Bastian Schweinsteiger netted a second-half penalty to level and then scored the winner from close range in the 89th minute.

In the other Group E clash, AS Roma scored their first win of the Champions League campaign with a 2-1 win over Romanian side CFR Cluj at the Stadio Olimpico.

Goals from French central defender Philippe Mexes and Italy striker Marco Borriello gave Claudio Ranieiri's men the points despite Ionut Rada's late consolation strike.

Cluj had beaten Roma on their home ground in their Champions League debut two years ago but could not repeat the feat.

But they are level on three points with the Serie A giants after beating rock- bottom Basel in their group opener.

Meanwhile, English champions Chelsea hit back after their league defeat to Manchester City with a 2-0 victory over French champions Marseille at Stamford Bridge.

The win left Chelsea on top of Group F after two wins in their latest attempt to bring Europe's top prize to club owner Roman Abramovich.

An early goal from John Terry and Nicolas Anelka's first-half penalty sealed the three points ahead of a crunch Premier League clash against Arsenal at the weekend.

Chelsea top Spartak Moscow on goal difference after the Russians also made it two wins from two with an earlier 3-0 victory over Slovakia's Zilina.

Brazilian striker Ari scored twice while compatriot Ibson added the third for a comfortable victory.
