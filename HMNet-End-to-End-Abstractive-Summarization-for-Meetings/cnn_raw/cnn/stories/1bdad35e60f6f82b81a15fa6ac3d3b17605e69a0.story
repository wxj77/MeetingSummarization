(CNN) -- Five members of Liverpool's backroom staff have followed manager Rafael Benitez in committing their long-term futures to the Premier League title challengers.

Rafael Benitez's backroom staff have followed his example in signing new contracts with Liverpool.

Benitez signed a new contract with the club last week, following months of speculation, keeping him at Anfield until 2014.

Now the Spaniard's lead has now been followed by assistant manager Sammy Lee, first-team coach Mauricio Pellegrino, goalkeeping coach Xavi Valero, fitness coach Paco de Miguel and chief scout Eduardo Macia -- all of whom have agreed contract extensions of at least two years.

"I said when I signed my own deal recently that it was a priority to sort out the future of the technical staff," Benitez told PA Sport.

"We work extremely well as a team, and continuity is essential if we are to build on the progress we have made this season and move the club further forward. I am delighted we have been able to sort out the contracts," he added.

The news caps a remarkable month for the club, who have thrashed Manchester United and Aston Villa to re-enter the Premier League title race and also crushed Real Madrid 5-0 on aggregate to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League.
