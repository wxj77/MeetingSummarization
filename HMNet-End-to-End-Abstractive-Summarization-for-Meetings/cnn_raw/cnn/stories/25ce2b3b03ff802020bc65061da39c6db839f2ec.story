(EW.com) -- The major broadcast networks are deep in the trenches of upfronts week, rebuilding their fall lineups for the future. But some people remain trapped in the past â€” specifically last week, when NBC finally canceled "Community" after five seasons of almost canceling "Community."

Rumors immediately began to circle that "Community" would get picked up for a long-prophesied sixth season by someone â€” Hulu, or Comedy Central, or I guess now WGN America is a thing? Those rumors led in turn to counter-rumors that Community showrunner/messiah/demonic inspiration Dan Harmon didn't actually want "Community" to continue. And there were probably other rumors, like the rumor about how "Community" star Danny Pudi's appearance in "Captain America 2" was intended to set up a future Marvel spin-off directed by Justin Lin where it turns out the characters on "Community" were the New Warriors the whole time.

Harmon has now taken to Tumblr to clarify his position, in a surprisingly serene post directed at Community fans. "I'm getting tweets from some anxious sounding fans," writes Harmon, "Tweets that make me anxious because I feel like I've made THEM anxious with my silence." He admits to some reticence to continue with the show: "When Sony called me on Friday with the news, there was brief discussion at the end of the call about the concept of the show living elsewhere, and I was definitely in the 'eh' column." But don't assume too much from that: "I said 'eh' on a Friday afternoon, I will change it to a 'sure, let's talk' on Monday morning and Sony can do their thing. I'm not going to be the guy that recancels cancelled Community."

Harmon cautions that "there are lots of reasons a Community resurrection could be difficult." But he also has a nice message for "Community" fans:

"I honestly think you can totally sit back and relax for this chapter. I know you don't feel relaxed but I mean you don't have to worry that someone on this planet isn't aware of this show's value to its audience. There are actually astronauts on a space station right now saying "we get it, you love Community" in Chinese. You have done your thing."

It's worth reading Harmon's whole post, which features, among other things, Harmon expressing a bit of skepticism about how the new system of TV can actually wind up exploiting fanbases, "like a corporation is doing you a favor by feeding you low grade opiate through a regulated tube." Meanwhile, rumors persist that NBC is in development on a new limited-run straight-to-series British Import drama starring Katherine Heigl, Feeding You Low Grade Opiate Through a Regulated Tube.
