A fire near the fuel tanks at Boston Logan International Airport was quickly extinguished Tuesday, but the incident  halted refueling operations and caused flight departure delays.

There were no injuries -- save for some serious headaches for some air travelers.

The underground airport  fueling system remained shut down Tuesday evening, meaning planes could not be refueled in Boston.

The fire near the "Fuel Farm" broke out at about 5 p.m. and was under control within a half hour, according to the Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates the airport.

Ed Freni, director of aviation at Logan, told  CNN that 15% of departing flights were delayed or canceled, and that 75% of flights departing after the fire had to schedule a fuel stop at another airport.

Freni says a handful of long-haul international flights are stranded in Boston tonight.

The airport did not know when repairs would be completed. The cause of the fire was under investigation, said port authority spokesman Richard Walsh.

Passengers were advised to check with their airlines on their flight status.
