(CNN) -- English club Arsenal will be without Robin van Persie and Theo Walcott for their Champions League last-16 second leg with Spanish champions Barcelona, but it is "possible" captain Cesc Fabregas could play.

Van Persie injured his knee scoring in Sunday's League Cup final defeat against Birmingham while Walcott sprained his ankle during the Premier League victory over Stoke City.

But Fabregas, who played a key part in Arsenal's thrilling 2-1 victory over Barcelona during the first leg in London, has an outside chance to make the second leg on March 8.

He limped off after just 14 minutes against Stoke with a hamstring strain but could be fit to face the club he left as a 16-year-old.

"Cesc is looking possible [for that game]," Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told the club's official website on Tuesday. "He is making quick and good progress. It is possible."

The news is more bleak on Dutch striker Van Persie, who is facing three weeks on the sidelines, meaning he will definitely be absent for Arsenal's trip to Spain.

Wenger added: "Unfortunately, we had bad news on the scan and he will be out for the next three weeks for sure.

"It could be longer. The shortest delay we can imagine is three weeks [so] he is definitely out for Barcelona."

England winger Walcott will also be absent, with Wenger confirming: "He is out. We said from the day he got the injury against Stoke you could count three weeks."

The clash with Barcelona has taken on added significance after Arsenal failed to end their six-year trophy drought thanks to a last-minute Carling Cup defeat against Birmingham at Wembley on Sunday.

Arsenal are looking to avenge last year's 6-3 aggregate defeat by Barcelona at the quarterfinal stage of Europe's premier club competition.
