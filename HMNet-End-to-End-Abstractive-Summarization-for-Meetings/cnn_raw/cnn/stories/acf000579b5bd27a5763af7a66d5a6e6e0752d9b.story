(CNNGo) -- Thai Airways International is catching heat for imposing weight restrictions on its 6,000 flight attendants. Those who don't shape up face the risk of being kept out of the sky.

According to a story in the Bangkok Post, flight attendants who don't meet the airline's body mass index and waistline controls, imposed last year, have been limited to service on domestic and same-day-return flights.

If they don't comply after a year, they will be transferred to ground services.

The 41 flight attendants affected -- 28 of them male -- recently complained to the Labour Protection and Welfare Department that the regulation violated their human rights and decreased their incomes.

They were told the regulation is not illegal and falls within the authority of management, which was concerned about customer service.

Earlier this year, female Thai Airways flight attendants over the age of 45 were given the option of early retirement through a buyout package instituted as part of the airline's drive to rejuvenate its image and save costs.
