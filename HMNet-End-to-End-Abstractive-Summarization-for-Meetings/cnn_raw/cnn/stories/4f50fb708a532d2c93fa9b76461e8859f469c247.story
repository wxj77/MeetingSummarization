(CNN) -- Operating from its corporate headquarters in New York City's Rockefeller Center, Sirius Satellite Radio broadcasts over 130 digital-quality channels, including 69 channels of commercial-free music, plus exclusive channels of sports, news, talk, entertainment, traffic, weather and data to more than 7.1 million subscribers.

Sirius' high-profile lineup of program hosts and providers includes Howard Stern, CNBC, CNN, Martha Stewart, BBC World Service, E! Entertainment, Maxim, NPR and Radio Disney.

Mel Karmazin has been the Chief Executive Officer of Sirius Satellite Radio since November 2004, overseeing all aspects of the company's operations.

He strongly supported shock radio talk-show host Howard Stern, recruited Martha Stewart, acquired the programming rights to NASCAR, and raised $500,000,000 in debt financing in 2005.

Most recently, Karmazin is slated to become CEO of the merger between Sirius and XM Satellite Radio when the two become one company pending federal approval. E-mail to a friend
