(EW.com) -- The guessing game of who will star in the adaptation of "Fifty Shades of Grey" — the erotic novel by E L James that has sold over 70 million copies worldwide — continues!

The film, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, is slated to hit theaters in August of next year, but so far the only news we've gotten are the names of actors who aren't going to appear in the movie. (For a list of all the actors who have denied rumors they'll star in the film — from Emma Watson to Sam's husband, Aaron Johnson-Taylor, please click here.) The latest names being bandied about for the roles of Anastasia "Ana" Steel and Christian Grey? Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam.

Dakota, 23, is the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. She's appeared in "The Social Network" (memorably with Justin Timberlake), "21 Jump Street," "The Five-Year Engagement," and the Fox show Ben and Kate. Hunnam, 33, most recently starred in this summer's Pacific Rim, as well as Undeclared and Sons of Anarchy.

However, a source at Universal cautions that they aren't close to making any casting offers at this time, which means the game is far from over. "Fifty Shades of Grey" is slated to hit theaters in August 2014.
