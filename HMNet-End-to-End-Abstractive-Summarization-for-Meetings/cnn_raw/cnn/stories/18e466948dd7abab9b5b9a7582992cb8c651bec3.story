(Mashable) -- Facebook plans to roll out a major redesign of user profiles at its f8 developer conference this week, Mashable has learned.

Details about the redesign are sparse, but two sources familiar with Facebook's plans (who have asked to remain anonymous) have told us that the redesign is "major" and will make Facebook profiles nexuses for consuming content.

The profile changes will be part of a wider launch, one that will include launch of a music and media platform.

Here's what we know so far about the profile redesign:

-- The redesigned profiles will be more "sticky," says one source. One of the goals of the new profiles is to get users to stay on them for longer.

-- We already knew Facebook is launching a media platform at f8. However, we've also learned that the platform -- which will include music and video from partner sites -- will display the media content a user is watching or listening to on their profiles. Essentially, when you're listening to Lady Gaga on Spotify, your friends can see and access that on your Facebook profile. This confirms a recent New York Times report.

-- The redesigned profiles are part of a larger push into social ecommerce. We don't exactly know what that means, but we've heard whispers that Facebook intends to give Facebook Credits more prominence. We've also heard that a Facebook app store may emerge at f8.

-- Facebook's push into ecommerce may be related Project Spartan, an HTML5-based mobile platform rumored to be launching soon.

Facebook is being tight-lipped about the changes; the company declined to comment on this story. However, more and more pieces of Facebook's big launch continue to leak out as the excitement builds for f8 (feel free to send us screenshots if you have any) The company is currently under lockdown, trying to fix the final bugs before Thursday's big launch.

What do you think Facebook will launch on Thursday? Let us know in the comments.
