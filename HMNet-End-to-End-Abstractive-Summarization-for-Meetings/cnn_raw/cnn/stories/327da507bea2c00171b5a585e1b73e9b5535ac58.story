(EW.com) -- Rapper, entrepreneur, actor, and investor Curtis James Jackson III, better known by his stage name 50 Cent, can add a new credit to his bio: God-awful pitcher.

The Queens-born rapper threw the first pitch at a Mets game last week, and missed, terribly. We mean really terribly. Really, really terribly. The Internet quickly responded, dubbing Fiddy's misstep one of the worst pitches ever, if not the worst.

In fact, the pitch was so bad that Jackson, known for hits like "Candy Shop" and "In Da Club," told Good Morning America that a cop pulled him over just to tell him, "You know that pitch was really terrible." Then, he let him go. No ticket, just a laugh.

Is Jackson's whiff really as bad as Carly Rae Jepsen, Carl Lewis, or Mariah Carey's attempts at first-pitchdom? Maybe not, but his explanation certainly was. In a Reddit AMA on Tuesday, a user asked, "Yo $0.50...what happened on that first pitch?" His response: "I have skeletal muscle injury on my left shoulder from excessive masturbation so take it easy lol."

He has to be kidding, right? You be the judge. For more of Fiddy's amusing banter, head over to the full Reddit AMA.
