Paris (CNN) -- Monaco newlyweds Prince Albert and Princess Charlene are suing the French magazine L'Express for spreading what they say were false rumours about them in the lead-up to their July 2 wedding.

The news magazine reported on its website June 28 that Princess Charlene, n√©e Wittstock, tried to flee for her home country South Africa days before the lavish wedding. It alleged that she wanted to leave after she discovered that Prince Albert had fathered a third illegitimate child while still engaged to her.

The prince has previously admitted fathering two children out of wedlock with two different women.

The press service for the royal palace confirmed Tuesday that a lawsuit had been filed.

In a statement July 22, Michel Roger, the principality's head of government, said the couple are suing the weekly magazine for "invasion of private life and printing fallacious information on its website following unfounded allegations." The royal couple's Paris-based lawyer, Thierry Lacoste, could not be reached for comment.

The article purported that Charlene was stopped from leaving the Nice airport after the palace tipped off police.

L'Express told CNN it could not comment on the issue since it has not yet received an official complaint from the royal couple. But in an article July 22, the magazine said it stands by its original reporting, which it said came from sources close to the wedding process.

French privacy laws are very strict, and prohibit publications from intruding on the private lives of public figures. Celebrities commonly file lawsuits against tabloid and gossip magazines and win damages from the publications.
