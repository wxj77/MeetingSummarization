London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth visited Wimbledon on Thursday, her first visit to the annual tennis tournament in 33 years.

The queen, wearing a teal outfit and matching hat and holding a small bouquet, was escorted through the grounds as tennis fans rushed to catch a glimpse of her.

The last time the queen attended the championships was in 1977, when she watched British player Virginia Wade win the ladies' singles title.

The queen greeted a lineup of past Wimbledon champions that included Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, Venus and Serena Williams, Jelena Jankovic and Roger Federer.

She then entered the royal box at Center Court, where she planned to watch Britain's fourth-seed Andy Murray play Finland's Jarkko Nieminen under mostly sunny skies.

The queen also planned to have lunch at the clubhouse with current and former players. Organizers said poached salmon, new potatoes and the traditional Wimbledon treat of strawberries and cream were likely to be on the menu.
