(CNN) -- Napoli missed a great chance to cut the gap on Italian league leaders AC Milan after crashing 2-0 at Chievo Verona as favored teams struggled to impress in Wednesday's games.

Walter Mazzarri's second-placed team could have moved within two points after Lazio held Milan 0-0 on Tuesday, but suffered a sixth defeat in 23 Serie A games.

Striker Davide Moscardelli put Chievo ahead in the 20th minute after controlling the ball well and curling a left-foot shot in off the post, and should have doubled the lead but miskicked with the goal at his mercy.

Defender Gennaro Sardo netted five minutes after halftime after winning the ball and beating three men before firing home to lift his team up to 10th in the table and completed the double over Napoli after the 3-1 away victory in September.

Palermo moved above the Turin team into sixth place as captain Fabrizio Miccoli beat goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from a tight angle in the seventh minute and midfielder Giulio Migliaccio headed the second on 20.

Udinese dropped to seventh after coming from behind to draw 1-1 at home to 14th-placed Bologna.

Captain Marco Di Vaio put the visitors ahead in the 65th minute, but defender Maurizio Domizzi leveled with 13 minutes to play.
