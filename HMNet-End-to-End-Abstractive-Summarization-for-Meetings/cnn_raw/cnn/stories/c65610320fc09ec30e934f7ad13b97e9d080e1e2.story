(CNN)  -- Glasgow Rangers won their 53rd Scottish title and ninth under manager Walter Smith as a 1-0 win over Hibernian on Sunday gave them an unassailable points advantage over city rivals Celtic.

Kyle Lafferty scored his third goal in four games to secure the three points for Rangers, who were the defending champions.

Earlier, Celtic beat Dundee United 2-0 with Senegalese striker Diomansy Kamara and Robbie Keane, with a last-minute penalty, scoring the goals.

It was their fifth straight league win under interim manager Neil Lennon, but Rangers' title triumph was a formality which was confirmed later at Easter Road.

Lafferty was on target after 17 minutes as Kenny Miller set him on his way to score with an angled drive.

Smith, who won his first seven Scottish titles with Rangers in his first spell at the club, savored the latest victory which has come against the backdrop of financial worries and uncertainty over the future ownership of the famous club.

"You always feel grateful for the fact that you've won a trophy and you are in this position, as Rangers teams are a lot of the time," he told gathered reporters.
