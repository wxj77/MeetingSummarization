(CNN) -- French actress Julie Gayet, the woman at the center of an alleged love affair with French President Francois Hollande, has received a best supporting actress nomination from the French Academy of Cinema Arts and Techniques, the academy said Friday.

Gayet's private life has been the subject of global headlines since the French magazine Closer said this month she had been having an affair with Hollande for two years.

Gayet was nominated by the academy for her performance in "Quai d'Orsay", a movie about the behind-the-scene intrigues at the French Foreign Ministry.

The annual Cesar Award Ceremony, France's equivalent to the Oscars, will take place on February 28 in Paris.

The President, who has not confirmed or denied the claims about the alleged affair, announced Saturday that his relationship with partner and first lady Valerie Trierweiler was over.

Trierweiler sent a goodbye message Saturday via Twitter to the staff at the presidential palace.
