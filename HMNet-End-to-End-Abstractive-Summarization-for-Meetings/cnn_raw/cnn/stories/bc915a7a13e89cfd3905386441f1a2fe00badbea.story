(CNN) -- A New Jersey woman traveling to an explosives demonstration in California was stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport after land mine casings were found in her luggage, the Transportation Security Administration said Tuesday.

TSA explosives experts were called to the checked baggage screening area in Terminal C when her suitcase set off alarms.

Inside the suitcase, officials found three small claymore land mine casings. Two of them were packed with shrapnel, the TSA said in a statement. There were no explosives or detonator in the bag, the statement said.

The unidentified woman, from Union, New Jersey, missed her original flight to San Francisco but was allowed to rebook her flight later -- without the weapons, the TSA said.

Explosive materials and realistic replicas of explosives are not permitted on planes, the TSA said.
