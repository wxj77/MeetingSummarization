(CNN) -- The superheroes of "The Avengers" are more assembled than they are apart.

After Joss Whedon's ensemble epic dominated most of 2012, this year's more singularly focused films didn't seem to resonate as well.

We asked our readers to vote for their 10 favorite films of 2013, and while the usual suspects make this list -- including Iron Man and Thor -- it's a fiery young woman who seals the top spot.

The cynical will smirk at the number of sequels and tentpoles that are counted among readers' Top 10, but just because moviegoers can enjoy a good action flick -- such as "Fast & Furious 6" -- doesn't mean they can't appreciate the nuance of something such as "12 Years a Slave."

If you missed our voting period, feel free to play along in the comments. Tell us your top 10 favorite films of the year.
