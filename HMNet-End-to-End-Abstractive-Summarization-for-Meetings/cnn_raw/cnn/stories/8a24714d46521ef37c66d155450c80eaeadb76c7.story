(CNN) -- Reality TV star Heidi Pratt was hospitalized Saturday in Costa Rica, her publicist confirmed.

Heidi Pratt was taken to a hospital for an undisclosed illness, her publicist said Saturday.

The details about Pratt's hospitalization were not immediately available.

Pratt, star of MTV's "The Hills," has been competing on NBC's "I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here," a reality show about surviving the jungle.

Pratt and her husband, Spencer, tried to quit the show earlier in the week, but later decided to return.

"We realized that we made a big mistake and that the devil got to us and said, 'Get out of the jungle,'" Pratt said. "We realized it's not even about us.

"It's about the charity, and it's about the experience here and we took that for granted," she said.
