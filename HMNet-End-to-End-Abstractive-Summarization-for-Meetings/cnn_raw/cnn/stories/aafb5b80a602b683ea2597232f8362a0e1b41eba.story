(CNN) -- Authorities near Nashville were still searching Tuesday for teenagers who escaped a detention center the night before.

Thirty-two teens escaped from the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center late Monday, Tennessee Department of Children's Services spokesman Rob Johnson said.

As of Tuesday, most had either turned themselves in or had been caught on nearby roads, Johnson said. Seven remained at large.

"They could be dangerous. They could be desperate," he told reporters.

The teens left their dorms around 11 p.m. Monday and began running around a large yard at the facility, Johnson said.

The yard is surrounded by a fence, and at some point, they discovered a way out under the fence, he said.

It's not known whether the escape was planned or was a spontaneous action, Johnson said.
