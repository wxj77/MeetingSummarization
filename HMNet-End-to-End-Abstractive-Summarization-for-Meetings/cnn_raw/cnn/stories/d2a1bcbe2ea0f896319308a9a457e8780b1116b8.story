(CNN) -- Louis Oosthuizen successfully defended his Volvo Golf Champions title in Durban Sunday despite still feeling the effect of injuries which have derailed his career.

The South African won the 2010 British Open at St Andrews and lost a playoff to Bubba Watson at the 2012 U.S. Masters but injuries ruined his challenge in the majors last season.

All that was forgotten as he won on home soil for the fourth year running and extended his record of claiming a title on the European Tour every year for the last five.

A run of four birdies in the last six holes saw him card a final round 68 for 12-under, one shot clear of compatriot Branden Grace and two ahead of Dutchman Joost Luiten and third round leader Tommy Fleetwood of England.

Oosthuizen is hoping he can take a well-deserved break and go into the first major of the season in Augusta in good shape.

"I've got three weeks now that I really need to work on my back," Oosthuizen told the official European Tour website.

"It's still not 100 per cent. Luckily this week I didn't have to hit a lot of drivers, but once I get to Augusta I need to hit driver," he added.

Grace birdied the final hole to put Oosthuizen under pressure, but he responded superbly with two birdies of his own to finish.

"I saw that Branden had made birdie on 18 so I knew that second shot was crucial to give myself a good opportunity and I hit it really close," he said.

"And then 18, everyone thinks you just need to make a birdie but around that green it's not easy and luckily I was far enough past where I could pitch it back into the grain and get it close."

Behind the title contenders, Ireland's Padraig Harrington, who has not won on the European Tour since his 2008 U.S. PGA triumph, came through the field with a 67 to finish tied fifth at nine under.
