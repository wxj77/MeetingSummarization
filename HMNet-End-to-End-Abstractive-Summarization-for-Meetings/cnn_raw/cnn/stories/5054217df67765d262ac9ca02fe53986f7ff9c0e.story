(CNN) -- Nestle Prepared Foods Co. on Tuesday announced a voluntary recall of a frozen spaghetti and meatballs dinner it manufacturers which may be contaminated with pieces of red plastic.

The recall applies to packages of LEAN CUISINE® Simple Favorites Spaghetti with Meatballs frozen dinners that were manufactured during a one-hour period in October, according to a news release by the Solon, Ohio-based company.

The production code on packages subject to the recall is 0298595519 P, the release stated.

"Nestle is taking this action after a few consumers reported they had found red plastic in the meatball portion of the entrée," the statement read. "No injuries were reported by any of these consumers."

"Thus far, the plastic complaints appear to be confined to a very short period of production," the company stated. "However, out of an abundance of caution, Nestle is recalling the entire hour code of that product."

The company stated that no other products were affected by the possible contamination.

The company advised customer to check their freezers for the product and, if they find it, examine the gray "proof of purchase" panel on the package's right end flap under the ingredient statement. If the recalled product code is there, customers are advised to call (866) 606-8264 or e-mail leancuisine@casupport.com for further instructions.
