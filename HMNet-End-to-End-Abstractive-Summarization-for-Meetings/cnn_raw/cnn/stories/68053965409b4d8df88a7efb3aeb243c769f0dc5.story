(CNN)First, the women. Now, the men. It seems everyone is getting in on the "Ghostbusters" reboot action.

But not everyone is happy about it.

Deadline reports that Sony Pictures is planning an all-male "Ghostbusters" reboot starring Channing Tatum and directed and produced by brothers Joe Russo and Anthony Russo.

The studio is also creating a production company, Ghostcorps, which will include Ivan Reitman and Dan Aykroyd, who were among the original "Ghostbusters" team, according to Deadline.

"We want to expand the Ghostbusters universe in ways that will include different films, TV shows, merchandise, all things that are part of modern filmed entertainment," Deadline quoted Reitman as saying.

The film "has a wonderful idea that builds" on the premise of an all-female "Ghostbusters" reboot expected to begin filming this summer. That film is expected to star Melissa McCarthy,  Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon.

"It's just the beginning of what I hope will be a lot of wonderful movies," Deadline quoted Reitman as saying.

All well and good. "Ghostbusters" is, after all, a well-loved comedy classic that gave the world the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.

But the news, close on the heels the much-lauded all-female "Ghostbusters" reboot, has met with mixed reviews.

"Couldn't u just let the girls have this one ONE FREAKING TIME?" Twitter user jessieroro13 posted.

Others think perhaps it's time to derail the Hollywood reboot train, no matter which gender is in the driver's seat.

"How about no #Ghostbusters reboots, redos or remakes," Twitter user EA_Creative wrote. "Why mess with perfection?"

The all-female "Ghostbusters" film is expected to be out next year. All all-male version is tentatively expected to begin filming in the summer of 2016, to be released the following year, Reitman told Deadline.
