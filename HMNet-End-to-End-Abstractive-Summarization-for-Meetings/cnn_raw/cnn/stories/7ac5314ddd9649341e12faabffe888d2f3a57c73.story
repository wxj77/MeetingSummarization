(CNN) -- Juventus became the first Italian club to reach 100 points in the league after comfortably defeating Cagliari 3-0 in their final Serie A match of the season.

The Old Lady of Turn had already secured their third scudetto in a row but goals from Fernando Llorente, Claudio Marchisio and an own goal by Cagliari goalkeeper Marco Silvestri, from a stunning Andrea Pirlo free kick that hit the post and bounced in off Silvestri, ensured that Juve finished on a record 102 points.

It has been a chaotic season of football in Italy, marred by fan violence, racism and continued failure in the UEFA Champions League.

Earlier this month the Italian Cup Final was delayed after three Napoli fans were shot before the game, causing Napoli's ultras to riot and throw flares on to the pitch.

But, domestically at least, Juve has been devastatingly consistent with a season of records for Antonio Conte's side.

The victory ensured that they maintained a 100 percent record of home victories throughout the season, winning 33 of their 38 games and finishing an incredible 17 points clear of their nearest rivals Roma.

"I want to say a massive thank you to all the players, every one of them has been phenomenal," Conte told Sky Sports Italia after the match. "Our objective was to win a third consecutive scudetto, instead we've set record after record."

Incredibly, given Conte's success since taking charge of Juventus, his position has been in some doubt with rumors suggesting he was Monaco bound.

"Tonight the appointment is to celebrate the title," Conte said when asked about his future. "My appointment with the club will come later."
