We may never know the why -- though there has been no shortage of speculation on the Internet -- but at least now we know what the Carter-Knowles family has to say about their already infamous elevator fight.

Solange Knowles, Jay Z and his wife, Beyonce, have released a statement about surveillance video originally posted by TMZ showing Solange, the younger sister of Beyonce, hitting and kicking her brother-in-law.

The trio had previously not spoken publicly about the incident in an elevator at the Standard Hotel in New York City following the Met Gala held on May 5. But on Thursday, they broke their silence.

The family referred CNN to a statement they previously gave to the Associated Press. The statement says:

"As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred.

"They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family.

"The reports of Solange being intoxicated or displaying erratic behavior throughout that evening are simply false. At the end of the day, families have problems and we're no different. We love each other and above all we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same."

Following the incident, the sisters were photographed leaving together while Jay Z left in a separate car.
