Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the abduction of 30 teenage boys who were seized from Pakistan's tribal region during an outing last week.

The militant group said it abducted the boys to punish their tribe for forming a pro-government militia to battle the Taliban.

The boys were taken Thursday from Bajaur Agency, which lies along the porous border with Afghanistan. It is one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region.

"Everyone who supports the government against Taliban will face the same fate," the Taliban spokesman said.

Islam Zeb, a senior administrator in Bajaur Agency, told CNN on Friday the boys were walking to a picnic spot along a river to mark the end of the Muslim month of Ramadan when they were taken.
