(CNN) -- Dider Drogba scored the only goal of the game against Sudan as much-fancied Ivory Coast got their Africa Cup of Nations campaign off to a winning start.

Drogba, who currently plays for English Premier League club Chelsea, grabbed the winner just before half time but Ivory Coast, nicknamed The Elephants, struggled for much of the game.

But the nation who many fancy for the title, especially given the absence of African heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt, got the job done to get off to a good start in Group B.

Ivory Coast dominated the opening half with Gervinho, who plays for English club Arsenal, squandering two good opportunities to score.

But Drogba pounced on 39 minutes to nod home a left wing cross from Chelsea teammate Salomon Kalou.

The goal stirred Sudan into action against a team ranked 102 places above them in the world soccer standings, as Eltaib Mudathe's shot was tipped onto the crossbar by Ivory Coast keeper Boubacar Barry.

Alaadine Yousif tested Barry after the interval but the keeper was equal to it, while at the other end Drogba again went close before substitute Max Gradel fired wide when well placed.

Ahmed Nazar had Sudan's last chance of the match but he shot wide of the target.

In the Group's other game, Angola beat Burkino Faso 2-1 thanks to a 68th minute winner from former Manchester United player Manucho.

Mateus had put Angola ahead just after half time but Alain Traore leveled the scores with a well taken free kick before Manucho's precise shot from outside the penalty area ensured Angola went joint top of Group B with Ivory Coast.
