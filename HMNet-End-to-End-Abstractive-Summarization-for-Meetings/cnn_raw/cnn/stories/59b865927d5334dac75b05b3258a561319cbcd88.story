"The Sixth Sense" star Haley Joel Osment hasn't lost interest in a good scare.

Now 26, the Oscar nominee popped up at this month's Toronto International Film Festival as one of the stars of Kevin Smith's horror movie "Tusk." The film, about a podcaster who goes missing in Manitoba and the friends who go searching for him, kicked off this year's event.

The movie, which also stars Justin Long, Johnny Depp and Genesis Rodriguez, is actually the first part of Smith's "True North Trilogy." The second installment, "Yoga Hosers," is currently filming -- and getting plenty of attention thanks to Osment's role.

The actor was photographed in Los Angeles on Tuesday in sporting a pinstripe suit, mustache and slicked-back hair, a visual that caught some fans off-guard.

Writer/director Smith explained on Twitter, "for those asking (about) the @YogaHosers pics of @HaleyJoelOsment, Haley is playing the Canadian Fuhrer, Adrien Arcand." Arcand was a Montreal journalist who led a series of fascist political movements between 1929 and 1967.

"Yoga Hosers" also stars Depp and his daughter, Lily-Rose Depp, along with Smith's daughter, Harley Quinn Smith. The film revolves around two 15-year-old yoga enthusiasts who team up with Depp's character to battle an ancient evil.

According to Variety, the film is Smith's answer to persistent questions from fans about his making a comic book movie.

"This is it," Smith told the publication. "But instead of yet another dude saving the day, our antiheroes are the most feared and formidable creatures man has ever encountered: two 15-year-old girls."

"Yoga Hosers" is set for release in theaters June 1.
