(CNN) -- Never underestimate the little guy.

At just 22 meters long, the new hi-tech America's Cup yacht is more than three meters shorter than its predecessor.

But that hasn't stopped the $10 million boat -- dubbed AC72 after its 72-foot hull -- making big waves in the sailing world.

The super sleek yacht makes its America's Cup debut this year, replacing the larger 25-meter ACC, which first raced in 1992.

Along with its shorter hull, the new vessel will also have far fewer members on board -- down from around 17 to 11.

But if you thought its smaller size and smaller crew made it less speedy, think again.

The new yacht features two hulls, giving it the appearance of a "flying boat," and helping it to cut across the water with ease.

But with greater speed -- around 40 knots -- comes greater safety concerns.

Earlier this year, British Olympic gold medalist Andrew "Bart" Simpson was killed when the AC72 he was training on capsized in San Francisco Bay.

As the 34th America's Cup kicks off in San Francisco next month, all eyes will be on the new fleet of futuristic -- and stripped back -- vessels.
