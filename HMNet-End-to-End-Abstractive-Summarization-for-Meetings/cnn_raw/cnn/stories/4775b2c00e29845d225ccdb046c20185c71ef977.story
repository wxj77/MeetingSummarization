(CNN) -- The 2018 Super Bowl will be played in Minneapolis, the National Football League announced Tuesday.

The league's owners selected Minnesota over New Orleans, with Indianapolis finishing third in the voting, according to NFL.com.

Super Bowl LII -- 52 in Roman numerals -- will be played in February 2018 in the Minnesota Multi-Purpose Stadium, which is now under construction and scheduled to open in 2016, the Minnesota Super Bowl Bid Committee said in a news release.

The stadium will normally seat 65,400 but will expand to 72,000 seats for the Super Bowl, the committee said.

"We are honored to have been in the company of two such fine competitors," said Melvin Tennant, president and CEO of Meet Minneapolis. "Both New Orleans and Indianapolis had extremely strong bids and their reputations precede them. We are excited to join their ranks in hosting a Super Bowl of the 21st Century."

The decision was announced Tuesday during the league's spring meetings in Atlanta.

The last Super Bowl to be played in Minneapolis in the was in 1992 in the now-demolished Metrodome, the NFL website said.

The 2015 Super Bowl will be played in Arizona at the University of Phoenix stadium, the 2016 game in San Francisco at Levi's Stadium and the 2017 game in Houston at Reliant Stadium.
