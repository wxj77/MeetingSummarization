(CNN) -- Hector "Macho" Camacho, the famed Puerto Rican boxer, is clinically "brain dead," a doctor said Thursday.

A gunman shot him in the face two days ago while he was seated in a black Ford Mustang in front of a bar in his hometown of Bayamon, Puerto Rico.

Camacho, a former lightweight and junior lightweight champion, was in the passenger seat of the car, sitting next to a man who was shot twice and killed, police said.

His family is now weighing whether to remove him from life support.

The suspects are two men who are believed to have been traveling in a gray vehicle, said Lt. Wilfredo Rivera, of CataÃ±o Police. They escaped after a shootout with police at a residential complex, WAPA TV reported.

During his career, Camacho, 50, awed fans with his quick hands and ring antics, developing a reputation for flamboyance. Though, he also battled a series legal issues stemming from drugs and other problems.

A southpaw, Camacho fought professionally for more than 25 years and last stepped into the ring in 2010.

He had a career record of 79 wins, six losses and three draws.
