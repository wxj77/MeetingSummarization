(CNN) -- Some legendary names in music and art are voicing their support for the Occupy movement, with a music compilation record called "Occupy This Album," the album producers say.

David Crosby, Jackson Brown, Devo, Third Eye Blind, Yo La Tengo, Lloyd Cole, The Guthrie Family and filmmaker/activist Michael Moore have signed on to the project, the producers said in a press release.

The album was inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement and will "provide an anthem and rallying cry for the protesters involved in the uprising," producers say.

Graham Nash, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and former member of the band Crosby, Stills and Nash has also signed on to help with the project, according to the press release.

"The Occupation movement is really the voice of the people, it's an idea that's been a long time coming. I fully support their non-violent protests against a system that is carefully crafted in favor of the rich one percent," Nash is quoted as saying.

Producers of the album say all of the proceeds will benefit the Occupy movement. 50% of the proceeds will be donated to the Occupy Wall Street General Fund. The other half of money generated will be distributed evenly among the major occupations across the country, according to Jason Samel of Music for Occupy, who is producing the album.

According to the press release, "Occupy This Album" is supposed to be released this winter.
