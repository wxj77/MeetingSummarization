(CNN) -- Neil Patrick Harris is officially a married man.

The 41-year-old actor revealed in a tweet on Monday that he and his partner of 10 years, David Burtka, exchanged vows in Italy on Saturday.

"Yup," Harris confirmed on Twitter. "We put the 'n' and 'd' in 'husband'."

The couple, who are also parents of 3 1/2-year-old twins Harper Grace and Gideon Scott, have been engaged for years. When New York legalized gay marriage in 2011, Harris said that he and Burtka, 39, had proposed to one another at least five years prior and had "been wearing engagement rings for ages."

According to E!, Harris and Burtka wore matching Tom Ford tuxedos at the wedding ceremony, which was officiated by their friend, "How I Met Your Mother" director and producer Pam Fryman, and included a performance from Elton John.

Harris, who came out as "a very content gay man" in 2006, told Details magazine in 2012 that he thought he'd always be single -- until he came across fellow actor Burtka.

"It's all baby steps: You have to be OK with telling your friends you're going on a date, you have to be OK with the people in your world meeting and judging them, you have to be OK with breakups," the "How I Met Your Mother" star said at the time. "I'm infinitely grateful all those steps led to Mr. Burtka -- once we started talking, we never stopped."

Harris and Burtka weren't the only celebrity couple throwing a wedding this weekend. Another TV star, Fran Drescher, said "I do" to Shiva Ayyadurai on Sunday.

According to People magazine, Drescher and Ayyadurai, who invented an email messaging program when he was a teenager, tied the knot in an intimate ceremony on the beach at their home. The couple met just over a year ago at an event hosted by Deepak Chopra, Ayyadurai told The Huffington Post in August.

This is Drescher's second marriage. Her first, to her high school sweetheart, ended in 1999 after her then-husband came out as gay.
