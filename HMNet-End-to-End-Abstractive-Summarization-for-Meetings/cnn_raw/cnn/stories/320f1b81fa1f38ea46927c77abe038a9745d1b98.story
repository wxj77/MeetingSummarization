Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital Friday after her doctor diagnosed her with "a massive blood clot," her publicist said.

Gabor's left leg was "swollen like hell" and she had an infection in her right leg, her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, said Friday evening, as his wife was being treated in the emergency room at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.

She had "no blood flow to her leg," Von Anhalt said.

Gabor "was complaining about her leg swelling and hurting her" Friday morning, so a doctor was called to her Bel Air, California, home, publicist John Blanchette said.

The doctor diagnosed Gabor with a "massive blood clot," which he feared could move from her leg to her heart, Blanchette said.

Paramedics took Gabor, 93, to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she had undergone hip replacement surgery in July, he said. She spent several weeks in the hospital over the summer.

She has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.

The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders.

Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, "Moulin Rouge;" "The Story of Three Loves" in 1953; "The Girl in the Kremlin" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, "Touch of Evil."
