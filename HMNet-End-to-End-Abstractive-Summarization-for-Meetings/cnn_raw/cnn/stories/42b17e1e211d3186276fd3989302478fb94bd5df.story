(CNN) -- Better mark your calendars: AMC's premiering its "Breaking Bad" spinoff, "Better Call Saul," across two nights in February.

The prequel series, which follows Bob Odenkirk's criminal lawyer Saul Goodman in his pre-Walter White years, will debut its first episode on Sunday, February 8, at 10 p.m. ET/PT. Instead of making viewers wait a week for the next installment, AMC will roll out episode two on February 9, also at 10 p.m. ET/PT. After that, the show will air Monday nights.

Developed by "Breaking Bad" creator Vince Gilligan and writer Peter Gould, "Better Call Saul" will trace Goodman's evolution from being a small-time lawyer named Jimmy McGill to the guy we came to know on "Breaking Bad."

The network started whetting appetites with a teaser trailer Friday.

"(D)uring AMC's first ever two-night series premiere event, we're going to introduce Jimmy McGill to the world," network President Charlie Collier said in a statement. "Known to 'Breaking Bad' fans as Saul Goodman, viewers will soon discover Saul wasn't always Albuquerque's top criminal (criminal) lawyer."

Odenkirk isn't the only "Bad" alum involved in the project; Jonathan Banks will also star in the series as fixer Mike Ehrmantraut.

AMC is clearly confident that "Better Call Saul" will be welcomed by audiences; the network has already picked it up for a second season.
