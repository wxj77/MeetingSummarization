(CNN) -- Louisiana State Police investigating wiretapping allegations against the New Orleans Saints football team said Monday they found no evidence any state laws were broken.

The investigation began in April after ESPN, citing anonymous sources, reported that Saints General Manager Mickey Loomis had a device in his Superdome suite that was wired to allow him to hear members of the opposing coaching staff from 2002 to 2004.

"This has been an intensive investigation, and after numerous interviews we have determined that there is no evidence that state laws have been violated," said State Police Superintendent Col. Mike Edmonson.

He cautioned that he was not in a position to comment on the status of a federal investigation that is being conducted by the FBI.

When the story first broke, Loomis vigorously denied the accusation.

"In my 29 years in the NFL, I have never listened to an opposing team's communications," he said. "I have never asked for the capability to listen to an opposing team's communications. I have never inquired as to the possibility of listening in on an opposing team's communications. And I have never been aware of any capability to listen in on an opposing team's communications at the Superdome or any NFL stadium."

The allegation came on the heels of another Saints scandal.

In March, the NFL penalized the Saints and members of its coaching staff for the team's bounty program.

The unprecedented punishment was handed down after an investigation found that the team had an active bounty program during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. During this time, players were purportedly offered payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game.
