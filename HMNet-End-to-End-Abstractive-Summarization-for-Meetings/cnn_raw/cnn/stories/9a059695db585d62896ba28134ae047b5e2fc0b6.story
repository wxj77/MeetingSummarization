(CNN) -- Italian giants Juventus and Roma have suffered blows with the news that star strikers Vincenzo Iaquinta and Francesco Totti have both undergone knee surgery.

Junventus revealed that tests on 29-year-old Iaquinta's left knee have revealed damage to his meniscus.

"The tests done have indicated the need for the player to undergo surgery," read a statement on the club's official Web site.

Iaquinta sustained the injury during training on Saturday and was forced to sit out Sunday's 1-0 victory at Siena.

The Italy international, who has scored four goals in eight appearances for the Bianconeri this season, could be sidelined until next year.

Meanwhile, Roma captain Francesco Totti has undergone surgery on his right knee.

The 33-year-old missed Roma's last two Serie A matches and also their draw with Fulham in the Europa League last week.

The club confirmed Totti will start his rehabilitation on Tuesday, but it is not yet known when he will be ready to return to action.

A statement on Roma's official Web site read: "The surgery was necessary after the player had problems during training.

"In the course of the surgery, no problems of any other nature were found. The player will be discharged and will now begin his rehabilitation. A return date will be determined depending on the player's condition."

Roma currently lie 12th in the Serie A table with 11 points from their opening nine matches.
