(CNN) -- Motley Crue singer Vince Neil checked out of a Sydney, Australia, hospital less than a day after surgery to remove kidney stones that forced a quick end to a Sunday concert, his manager said Monday.

Neil boarded a jet bound for Brisbane, where the Motley Crue show will go on Tuesday night, manager Allen Kovac told CNN.

"Vince is a remarkable frontman who has an amazing track record of performing for Motley Crue fans for 30 years," Kovac said.

"Severe pain" from kidney stones forced Neil, 52, to cut short Sunday's show after just four songs, guitarist Nikki Sixx told fans on his Facebook page.

"He was doubled over on his dressing room floor five minutes (till showtime) and was told by the promoter to not even play, but Vince said he couldn't do that to the fans," Sixx said. "I've seen Vinnie go onstage with broken bones, his voice completely blown out and torn ligaments but he never ever cancels. Just like an athlete you sometimes have to play through the pain, but last night it became (too) excruciating."

Surgeons removed Neil's stones early Monday, Kovac said.

"He has been having problems for the last few days with kidney stones," Kovac said.

"Vince is a warrior who has played shows through a wide ranging list of injuries. If there is a way to safely perform, he always does," Kovac said. "In nearly 20 years of managing Motley Crue, I can't recall a show the band has canceled."
