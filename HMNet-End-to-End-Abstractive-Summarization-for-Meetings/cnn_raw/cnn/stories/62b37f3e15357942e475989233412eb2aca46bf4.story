(CNN) -- Is Blake Lively pregnant? All signs point to yes.

In a column published on Lively's website Preserve, there's a photo of the 27-year-old actress cradling what appears to be a baby bump, suggesting that Lively and husband Ryan Reynolds are expecting their first child.

No one has yet said "we're expecting," but the image combined with the column's topic of family seems to say it all.

" 'Family' is the single word our founder, Blake built this home on," the Preserve editorial team writes in the column, titled "Preserve Celebrations: Falling for Family."

"With family on our mind, we looked to the origin of it all -- to the women in our lives who are right there, at that special moment; at the creation of family. Today we celebrate them... Congratulations to all the expecting mothers out there."

Since getting married in 2012, both Reynolds and Lively have been vocal about wanting a big family. Reynolds told Details magazine in August 2013 that they "both come from big families -- my parents did four, Blake's did five. A lot of people say it's crazy, but we'll only know when we're there, you know? We'll walk through that fire pretty happily, I think."

And more recently, Blake told Marie Claire magazine in September that she was raring to go.

"I gotta get started," the "Gossip Girl" actress said. "If I could spit out a litter of kids, I would."

Representatives for Reynolds and Lively did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
