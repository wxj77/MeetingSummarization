(CNN) -- At first glance it looks like a fairly unremarkable watercolor of a woman with soft brown curls peeking from her white bonnet.

First impressions can be wrong.

This painting of Jane Austen, the author behind famous novels "Pride and Prejudice" and "Sense and Sensibility," has sold at auction for £164,500 ($270,000).

It's the same image which is set to grace £10 notes across Britain, from 2017.

The painting was commissioned by the Victorian novelist's nephew in 1869, and was sold by auction house Sotheby's to an anonymous private collector.
