(CNN)He's a virtual unknown to American audiences, but James Corden proved he had what it takes as a late night host.

Corden's debut as the fourth host of CBS' "Late Late Show" on Monday night was one of the smoothest first episodes of any new talk show hosts in recent memory.

Ignoring the usual five minutes or so of monologue jokes, Corden launched right into a star-studded pre-taped bit that showed how he got the job of host: by picking up one of CBS president Les Moonves' Willy Wonka-esque golden ticket dropped by Chelsea Handler (a joke referencing rumors that she was in talks for the job Corden won).

Corden received advice from Jay Leno, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Meryl Streep as he trained to be the best host he could be.

In a nod to one of his influences, Graham Norton, Corden brought out his two guests, Mila Kunis and Tom Hanks simultaneously.

In the midst of their conversation, Kunis, who was sporting a ring, seemed to confirm (with a "maybe") that she had just married Ashton Kutcher, though that still hasn't been confirmed and it may be that Corden, Hanks and Kunis are pulling our leg.

The highlight of the show, however, was Corden and Hanks' rapid fire rundown of his movie career, which has to be seen to be believed.

Corden's predecessor, Craig Ferguson, sang the new show's theme song, and Corden - who co-starred in the musical film "Into the Woods" - ended his first show with an original song.

If Twitter reaction is any indication, Corden charmed enough viewers to draw viewers back Tuesday night.
