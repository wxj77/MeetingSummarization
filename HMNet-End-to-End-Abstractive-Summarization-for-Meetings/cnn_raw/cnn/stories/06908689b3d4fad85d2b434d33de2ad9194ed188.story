(CNN) -- Ferrari's Fernando Alonso has told CNN Sport's Don Riddell that Michael Schumacher is still the fastest driver on the Formula One grid.

Speaking ahead of the opening grand prix of the season in Melbourne, Australia, Alonso -- himself a double world champion -- believes that seven-time world champion Schumacher remains a cut above his rivals.

"If Formula One was 24 cars exactly the same, then Michael would be the driver I would fear most," revealed Alonso.

"If you look down the list of drivers on the grid for 2011, then one name stands out above the rest, Michael Schumacher.

"Michael is a seven-times world champion and is a legend in Formula One. We have to respect him because he has the ability and talent to do well this season."

Despite not winning the drivers' title since 2006, Alonso confirmed that should he retire without another championship to his name, he would still be more than happy with his career.

"Not many drivers have had the opportunity to win one world title, let alone two. I have already had nine years in Formula One and hopefully have another six or seven to come," added the Spaniard.

"I could spend nearly a quarter of my life in this wonderful sport, doing what I love to do, so I consider myself lucky and am very happy."

Despite this, Alonso confirmed that coming so close to his third world title last year, left him sad and frustrated.

"The first three or four days after the end of the season were not the best for me," Alonso confirmed. "But I feel that Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull won the title rather than Ferrari losing it.

"Coming so close last year makes the team determined to go one better this time around," he added.

"Everybody at Ferrari was devastated by the result at Abu Dhabi last year but we are all very motivated now for 2011."
