(CNN Student News) -- Students will interview U.S. military veterans to learn about the sacrifices that these men and women have made in the defense of our country.

Procedure

Generate a class discussion about the sacrifices that military personnel have made and continue to make in the defense of freedom. Next, have each student conduct a video or audio interview with a U.S. veteran. Encourage students to locate veterans by asking their friends and family members, or by contacting a local Veterans Center. Prior to conducting the interviews, have students brainstorm a list of questions that they might want to ask the veterans to learn about their experiences in the armed forces. Some interview questions might include:

After students complete their interviews, have them prepare multimedia presentations of their findings. The presentations should include photos, video or audio clips, and maps that depict where the veterans served. Have students deliver their presentations to the class and invite local veterans to attend the event.
