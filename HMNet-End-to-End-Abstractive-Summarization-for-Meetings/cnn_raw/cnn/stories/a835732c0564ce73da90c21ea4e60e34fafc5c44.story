Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Authorities in Argentina's capital are searching for at least three people who allegedly broke into a bank through an underground tunnel, state media reported.

Investigators believe the thieves entered the bank through a 30-meter (98-foot) tunnel -- replete with rugs, lighting and ventilation, the state-run Telam news agency said.

"It was truly impressive," prosecutor Martin Niklison told Telam.

Authorities traced the tunnel to a rented business space on the same block in Buenos Aires where the bank is located. It was rented in July, Niklison said, according to Telam.

The suspects broke into more than 130 safe-deposit boxes during the robbery, which occurred when the branch of Banco Provincia de Buenos Aires was closed over the New Year's holiday weekend, Telam said.

Bank security cameras recorded images of the suspects leaving with money and stolen objects, the news agency reported.
