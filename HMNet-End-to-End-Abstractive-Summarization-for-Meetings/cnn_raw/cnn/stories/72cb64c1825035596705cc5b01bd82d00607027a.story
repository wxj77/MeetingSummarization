(CNN) -- TLC reality star Jill Duggar knocked out two firsts with one wedding.

The 23-year-old daughter of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar -- the couple who star in the reality show "19 Kids and Counting" along with their massive brood -- had her first kiss on Saturday as she tied the knot for the first time.

Jill's romance with her new husband, Derick Dillard, has been swift but old-fashioned. The two were introduced by Jill's dad, who connected with 25-year-old Derick while he was doing missionary work in Nepal. After starting their courtship in November, the couple announced their engagement in April.

"When my dad first introduced Derick and I, we spent hours texting, calling, and talking on Skype while 8,000 miles away from each other. And when we finally met in person in Nepal, we knew within days that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together," Jill Duggar told ABC News at the time.

Because of their shared Christian faith, the couple didn't hold hands until they got engaged, and saved their first kiss for their wedding day.

"We're just really trying to keep our relationship focused not on the physical but really just more on communication and continuing to learn more about each other," Jill has said. "We're saving our first kiss and things beyond that for our wedding."

And on June 21, Jill and Derick finally had the moment they'd been waiting for. In front of more than 1,000 guests at a church in Springdale, Arkansas, the couple said their "I do's" and shared their first lip-lock. Derick, who's whisking his new bride off to an undisclosed location for their honeymoon, told People magazine that he supported their courtship's lack of physical contact.

"You can really get to know each other on every level without the physical part of it," he said. "I am the most blessed man to have Jill."
