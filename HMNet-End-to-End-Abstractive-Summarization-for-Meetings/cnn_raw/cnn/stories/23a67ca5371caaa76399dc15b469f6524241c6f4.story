(CNN) -- A man shot this month when a gunman opened fire inside a busy Toronto shopping mall died as a result of his injuries Monday, raising the death toll from that shooting to two, police said.

The name of the second victim, a 22-year-old man, cannot be released because of a court-ordered publication ban, Toronto police said in a statement.

The first victim, Ahmed Hassan, 24, died the day of the shooting, June 2.

Gunfire started around 6:25 p.m. that day, as people were eating dinner in the crowded food court area of the Eaton Centre mall in downtown Toronto. Seven people were shot, while a pregnant woman was "stomped on" in the resulting frenzy, Detective Sgt. Brian Borg, the lead investigator in the case, has said.

A suspect, Christopher Husbands, surrendered to authorities and is currently in custody. He faces one count of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted murder, according to police.

Husbands, 23, was supposed to be under house arrest when police say he went to the mall and opened fire.
