(CNN) -- Look out Lannisters ... Windsor is coming.

Queen Elizabeth came face to face with royalty of a very different kind when she met the cunning Cersei -- otherwise known as actress Lena Headey -- on a visit to the "Game of Thrones" set in Northern Ireland on Tuesday.

The monarch and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, were touring Belfast when they called in at the sound stage where the hit show -- famed for its violent scenes and frequent nudity -- is filmed.

"Game of Thrones" showrunner David Benioff and writer and producer Daniel Weiss guided the royal party around the Paint Hall studio in the city's Titanic Quarter.

During the visit, the Queen met the show's prop and costume makers and set designers, as well as actors Kit Harrington (Jon Snow), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), Conleth Hill (Lord Varys) and Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark).

The Queen was spotted looking with interest at the Iron Throne, supposedly forged from the swords of defeated warriors -- but chose not to sit down and put her feet up.

Instead, she was offered a small model of the saga's famous seat as a souvenir.

It is not clear if Queen Elizabeth or any of the royal family are fans of the award-winning HBO show, which is screened around the world.

"Game of Thrones" has been filmed in Northern Ireland since 2009, contributing millions of dollars to the local economy during the past five years, providing thousands of jobs, and encouraging tourism to a region once bitterly divided by sectarian violence.

Season four of the critically-acclaimed fantasy drama recently concluded in typically gory fashion; fifth and sixth seasons are planned.
