(CNN) -- Few television specials capture the magic and fun of Halloween like the animated classic "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown."

In case it's been awhile, the 45-year-old hit follows Linus' quest to connect with the Great Pumpkin, a Santa-like gift-giver, in spite of everyone's biting disbelief. Meanwhile, like a little Rodney Dangerfield, Charlie Brown gets a lot more disrespect and more tricks than treats like only he can.

As it has for the past 10 years, ABC will be broadcasting "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown" at 8 p.m. Thursday October 27, making it just one of the tasty treats couch potatoes can anticipate.

But all the offerings aren't cute and cuddly and for those looking for chills, there are a handful of scary choices that will have you screaming up a storm.
