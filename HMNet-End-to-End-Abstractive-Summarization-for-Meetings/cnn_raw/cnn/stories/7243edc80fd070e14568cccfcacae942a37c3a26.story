(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton extended his Formula One drivers' championship lead after finishing second behind Red Bull's Mark Webber at the British Grand Prix.

World champion Jenson Button, who narrowly missed out on his first podium finish at Silverstone after coming fourth, still trails McLaren teammate Hamilton in second.

Third-placed Webber stormed back into title contention after winning his third race of the season. The Australian leapfroged fellow Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel, who is 24 points adrift of Hamilton in fourth.

McLaren also lead Red Bull by 29 points at the top of the constructors' championship.

Ferrari's Fernando Alonso stayed fifth overall but lost ground after earning no points, ending the race in 14th after being given a drive-through penalty for illegally overtaking Robert Kubica of Renault off the track.

Nico Rosberg of Germany continues to outperform his Mercedes teammate Michael Schumacher, recording his third podium finish this season to replace Kubica in sixth.
