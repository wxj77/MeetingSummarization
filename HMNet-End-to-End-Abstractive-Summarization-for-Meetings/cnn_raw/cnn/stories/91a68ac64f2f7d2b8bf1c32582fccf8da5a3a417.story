Assailants torched three trucks carrying fuel for U.S. and NATO forces Sunday in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province, police said.

Police official Nazeer Ahmed said four attackers ambushed the trucks in the Mastung district, just south of Quetta, near the border with Afghanistan.

He said no one was injured during the attack, as the drivers escaped before the trucks were set ablaze.

"Roaring flames of fire can be seen from quite far away," he said.

Ahmed said the tankers were bound for Afghanistan, which is landlocked and relies heavily on Pakistani ports for imported goods.

Attacks on fuel trucks have become common in Pakistan as assailants try to cut off supplies to NATO forces in Afghanistan and try to block the fuel supply for purported U.S. drones that allegedly target suspected militants in northwest Pakistan.

The most recent attack came two days after assailants torched two tankers and killed a driver in another part of Balochistan.
