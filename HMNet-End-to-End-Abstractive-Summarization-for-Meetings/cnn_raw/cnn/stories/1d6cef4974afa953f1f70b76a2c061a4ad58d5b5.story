The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived in New York City on Sunday as they begin a busy three-day visit to the United States.

A crowd gathered outside the hotel where William and Kate are staying hours before the royal couple arrived.

Police were on hand to keep the crowds a safe distance away.

Many of those who gathered said they were more interested in catching a glimpse of Kate, who is pregnant with her second child. The couple's toddler, Prince George, did not make the trip.

William and Kate have a private dinner for donors to their foundation on Sunday night.

On Monday their itinerary includes everything from a children's craft group in Harlem, a conservation reception with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, to an NBA game where they're likely to rub shoulders with Beyonc√© and husband Jay Z.

William will split for a while Monday for a trip to Washington, where he will meet with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.

On Tuesday, their plans include a moment of reflection at the September 11 memorial and a glittering charity dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art.

The White House said William's visit underscored "the special relationship" between the United States and the United Kingdom.
