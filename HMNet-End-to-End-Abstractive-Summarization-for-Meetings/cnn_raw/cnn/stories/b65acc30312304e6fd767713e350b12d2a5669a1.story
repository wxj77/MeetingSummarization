(CNN) -- Chinese pair Yuan Cao and Yanquan Zhang claimed gold in Monday's men's synchronized ten meter diving final. The reigning world champions scored 99.36 with a near faultless final dive to claim the Olympic title.

The silver medal went to Mexican pair Ivan Garcia-Navarro and German Sanchez-Sanchez, who pushed the American team of David Boudia and Nicholas McCrory into the bronze medal position with a strong final set of dives.

"We're very happy. Coming from China, of course, we hope we can win more medals," said Cao.

"If we are strong at diving it comes from good coaching, diving every day and hard work. Nothing more."

Tom Daley, icon of the British team, and his partner Pete Waterfield led after two rounds, but blew their chances of a medal with a poor dive in round four.

British Prime Minister David Cameron made his first trip to the aquatics center to see Daley and Waterfield in action, but he couldn't spur the pair to a podium finish.

Cao, 17, and Zhang, 18, had been favorites to take gold in London after a dominating display in February's world championships, also held at the Olympic aquatic center.

China now have two diving golds after Wu Minxia and He Zi won the women's synchronized three meter springboard diving on Sunday.

"We had the highest score we have ever got after the first three, but at this level of competition, you can't afford to miss a single dive," Daley said afterwards.

The 18 year old diver refused to blame a mistake from Waterfield, 31, in the fourth round for their failure to win a medal, declaring that "you win as a team and you lose as a team."
