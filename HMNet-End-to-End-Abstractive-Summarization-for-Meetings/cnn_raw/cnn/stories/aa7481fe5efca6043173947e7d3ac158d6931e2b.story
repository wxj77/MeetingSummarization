(CNN) -- Environmental activist Philippe Cousteau is to explore the Arctic with CNN to show how scientists in the wilderness are studying climate change in one of the coldest places on the planet.

For "Extreme Science" Cousteau will see first-hand how they operate in brutal sub-zero temperatures, severe storms and high winds, collecting data on water and ice while living in a tent village on the ice.

And while he's there between March 23 and April 4 he'll try to answer your questions about life at the top of the world and how the work there can impact everyone's lives.

Scientists are using new radar technology to measure the thickness of sea ice without the need to dig holes.

Their work will try to determine just how fast the ice is melting and what will be the effects on weather patterns, ocean currents and marine life.

Cousteau, grandson of the legendary Captain Jacques Cousteau, will be CNN special correspondent inside the Arctic Circle.

He is the CEO of Earth Echo International -- a non-profit organization dedicated to educating youth about environmental issues.

He is also co-founder of Azure Worldwide, a strategic environmental design, development and marketing company.

Cousteau, 31, reported last year for CNN International on the Gulf oil spill and has hosted green-themed specials.

He founded and co-chairs the Gulf Action Network for the Clinton Global Initiative and has testified to the U.S. Congress on ocean management and off-shore drilling.

He is also chief ocean correspondent at Discovery's Animal Planet and hosted "Ocean's Blue," a Discovery/BBC collaboration last year.

Publications from "Sport Diver" and "National Geographic" have published Cousteau's stories from around the world.

He serves on the Board of Directors of The Ocean Conservancy, the Marine Conservation Biology Institute, and the National Environmental Education Foundation.
