(CNN)When last we saw Kevin Spacey's ruthless Frank Underwood, he had just schemed and backstabbed his way from Congress to the Oval Office.

But there's a reason the show is called "House of Cards." Even as newly sworn President Underwood, his grip on power will no doubt remain precarious.

"You want to know what takes real courage?" he asks in the new trailer for Season 3 of Netflix's hit drama "House of Cards," coming next month. "Holding it all together when the stakes are this high."

Only 45 seconds long, the trailer teases more than it reveals. In a menacing, David Fincheresque style -- all dark palette and jittery score -- it suggests that things will not go smoothly for the new president and his Lady Macbeth of a first lady, played by Robin Wright.

We see grim-faced administration officials reacting to some sort of crisis, a fleet of police cars with sirens blaring and a glimpse of hacker-informant Gavin, one of a handful of people who possess knowledge that could bring down the Underwoods.

We also learn that Claire Underwood may know more about her husband's clandestine criminal activity than she's been letting on.

"We're murderers, Francis," she says in what appears to be a rare display of self-doubt.

"We're survivors," he responds in that oily Southern drawl that reminds you why Spacey won best actor in a TV drama at the Golden Globes on Sunday night.

Netflix will release all 13 episodes of the new season February 27.
