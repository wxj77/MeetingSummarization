(RollingStone.com) -- Lady Gaga and Elton John, who teamed up to open the 52nd Annual Grammys back in January, have collaborated on a new song, "Hello, Hello."

It will appear on the soundtrack for the animated Disney film "Gnomeo and Juliet" (and not on Gaga's upcoming album "Born This Way,") EW's The Music Mix reports.

The film hits theaters February 11th, 2011. Gaga and John performed "Pokerface," "Speechless" and Elton's "Your Song" at the Grammys, and John has since been keen on working with Gaga on new music.

"I'd love to [work with her] in the future," John recently told EW. "There's a chance I might do one track with her [for "Born This Way,"] but it's just, she's so busy, and I'm so busy, we can never get together!"

John, who is a producer on "Gnomeo and Juliet," co-wrote the movie's soundtrack with composer James Newton Howard.

He has contributed music to movies before -- most notably with his Oscar-winning "The Lion King" soundtrack -- "Hello, Hello" marks Gaga's first contribution to a film.
