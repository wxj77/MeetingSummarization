(CNN) -- The Miami Heat went cold after 27 consecutive winning games and failed to match the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers' winning streak of 33. The Heat joins many others in and out of sports that have come oh-so-close to the record books.

Here are a few examples:

- The New England Patriots fell painfully short of being the second NFL team to ever go through a whole season without losing. The Pats were just two minutes away from winning the Super Bowl in 2008 when New York Giants pulled a miraculous comeback. If the Pats won that game, they would have joined the 1972 Dolphins as the only NFL teams to have a perfect season.

- Tiger Woods won seven consecutive PGA Tour events from July 2006 to January 2007. He botched a chance to win an eighth event when he missed a short birdie putt that would have clinched a victory in the third round of a match play tournament. Byron Nelson won 11 straight Tour tournaments in 1945.

-This year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average went on a winning streak over 10 consecutive trading sessions, which ended on March 15 when the Dow fell roughly 25 points or 0.2%. It came close to the longest win streak on record of 13 trading sessions in 1987.

- Pete Rose had a 44-game hit streak in 1978 that ended against the Atlanta Braves and reliever Gene Garber. After the game, Rose, still 12 games away from Joe DiMaggio's major-league record, fumed that Garber didn't throw fastballs to strike him out. Garber got him out with a slow changeup.

-The New York Mets' R.A. Dickey took a run in 2012 at Orel Hershiser's record (set in 1988) of 59 consecutive scoreless innings. Dickey threw 44.2 consecutive scoreless innings from May 22 to June 24 last year.

-The Detroit Lions made a run during the 2008-2009 season at the record for most consecutive games lost. They lost 19, finishing second behind the 1976-1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers who lost 26 consecutive games in a row.

- Speaking of infamous records, the Charlotte Bobcats came within three games of tying the NBA record of most losses in a row. The embattled team lost 23 straight games at the end of the 2011-12 season. They began the 2012-13 season with a victory over the Indiana Pacers, leaving them three losses short of the 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers.
