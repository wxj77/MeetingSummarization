WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal investigators at the Nestle USA plant in Danville, Virginia, have found evidence of E. coli bacteria in an unopened package of raw chocolate chip cookie dough, two sources at the Food and Drug Administration told CNN Monday.

A Nestle spokeswoman says the tainted product was in a 16.5-ounce package and read "best before 10 JUN 2009."

Researchers were testing the bacteria to determine if it bears the same genetic fingerprint as the E. coli linked to an outbreak of illness that has affected at least 69 people in 29 states.

The tainted sample was manufactured last February 10 at the Nestle Plant in Danville, said the sources, both of whom requested anonymity.

All of the infected persons had been confirmed as having the outbreak strain of E. coli 0157:H7, the CDC said Monday.

Those affected range in age from 2 to 65, however 64 percent are less than 19 and 73 percent are female.

Thirty-four people have been hospitalized and nine developed a kidney disease called hemolytic uremic syndrome. No deaths have been linked to the outbreak.

A spokeswoman for Nestle said the company's baking division was informed Monday of the finding. She said the tainted product was in a 16.5-ounce package that had a day code of 9041 and a "best before 10 JUN 2009" on the package.

The plant where the dough was produced has been shut since June 18.
