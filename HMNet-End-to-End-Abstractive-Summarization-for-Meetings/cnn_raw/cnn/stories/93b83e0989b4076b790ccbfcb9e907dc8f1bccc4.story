(CNN) -- Alastair Cook made a superb century as England remained on course to leapfrog opponents India as the number one ranked Test team in the world.

On another dominant day for England in Birmingham they finished on 456-3, to lead by 232 after India slumped to 224 all out in their first innings.

Cook took full advantage of a lackluster Indian bowling attack by batting all day for an impressive 182 not out with captain Andrew Strauss and Kevin Pietersen also notching half centuries.

England are now odds on favorites to go 3-0 up in the four match series and confirm their status as number one.

Resuming on 84-0, Strauss and Cook made a patient start and amassed another 100 runs before Strauss was bowled by Amit Mishra for 87.

Ian Bell made a confident 34 and the ball before he was clean bowled by Praveen Kumar, Cook notched up his 19th century to a standing ovation from the Edgbaston crowd.

Pietersen made a brisk start to his innings with Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma coming in for particular punishment. He and Cook put on 122 for the third wicket before Pietersen was given out LBW off Kumar.

But that was India's final breakthrough of the day as Eoin Morgan and Cook put on another 82 before the close of play.

India now face a huge task to save the match and prevent being usurped at the top of the world rankings.

"It's always nice to score runs and especially pleasing when you haven't scored in the last two tests," Cook told a press conference.

"It's been frustrating not getting through that new ball and it was important that when I did I made it count.

"I did a bit of work last week to get myself into better positions as I might have been falling over slightly but the conditions in the last couple of tests have been very tough."
