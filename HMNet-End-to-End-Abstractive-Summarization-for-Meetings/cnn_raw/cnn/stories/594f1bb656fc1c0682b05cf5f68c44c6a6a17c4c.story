(CNN) -- Jorge Lorenzo moved closer to the MotoGP world championship on Sunday with a decisive win at the San Marino Grand Prix.

The Yamaha Factory Racing rider is now 38 points clear at the top of the riders' standings with just five races remaining, after his nearest rival Dani Pedrosa crashed out on the first lap.

It was an emotional weekend at the track which is now named after Marco Simoncelli, the Italian who lost his life following a crash in Malaysia in October 2011.

Simoncelli's compatriot and close friend Valentino Rossi produced his best ride of the season to finish behind 2010 champion Lorenzo in second place.

"This second place is something special," seven-time riders' champion Rossi told BBC Sport after the 13th race of 2012.

"I have a lot of fans in Misano, my hometown is only a few minutes away, but more importantly this is in the name of Marco.

"This result is for him and for his family. I think Marco helped me to achieve this today."

It was a miserable race for Repsol Honda's Pedrosa, who had qualified for the grand prix in pole position.

The first race start had been abandoned, due to Karel Abraham stalling his Ducati, before Pedrosa was forced to start from the back of the grid after experiencing a problem with his front tire.

When the race eventually got underway, a nightmare Sunday for Spain's Pedrosa was completed when he was forced off the track and out of the race by Hector Barbera of the Pramac Racing Team.

The 14th round of the 2012 championship will take place at Motorland Aragon in Spain on September 30.
