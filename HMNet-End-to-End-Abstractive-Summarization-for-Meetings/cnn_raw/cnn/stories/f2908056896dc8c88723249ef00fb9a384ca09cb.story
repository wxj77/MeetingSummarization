(PEOPLE.com) -- Kevin Bacon is not the kind of guy to look back at his past work.

But when the studio unearthed his audition tape from 1984's original "Footloose," he couldn't help himself.

"It was like a weird time-travel, out-of-body type thing," Bacon, 53, told PEOPLE. "It's like if you went and saw the interview you did for your first job. Wow. I literally turned the thing off, went into the bathroom, looked myself in the mirror and went, 'Jesus, is that even the same guy?' "

So was he impressed with himself?

"Honestly, I was," says Bacon, who at the time he shot the movie was a relatively unknown off-Broadway actor, despite roles in "Animal House," "Friday the 13th" and "Diner." "The energy, the hunger, the determination ... it was cockiness really. I oozed it."

Double Vision

While Bacon is justifiably proud of himself and the film -- which went on to earn more than 10 times its reported $8 million budget -- he does have a few regrets. For one, while he says he did a majority of his own dancing, he wished he had been able to do some of the flips and complicated dance moves in the movie's famous warehouse scene. "Are you kidding? I was furious," Bacon says with a smile. "It's like a starting pitcher getting taken out of a game -- no one wants to be told they can't get the guy out."

On the day of the movie's famous warehouse shoot, "I had a stunt double, a dance double and two gymnastics doubles," recalls Bacon. "There were five of us in the f---ing outfit, and I felt horrible."

One thing that Bacon was unwilling to do was stay quiet about his dance double.

"When the movie came out, the studio told me to never mention that they used a double," he says. "While I was in no position to do this, I told them, ''You are out of your f---ing mind!' "
