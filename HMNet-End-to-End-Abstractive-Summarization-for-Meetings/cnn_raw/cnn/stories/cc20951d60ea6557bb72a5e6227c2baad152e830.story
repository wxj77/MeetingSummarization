(CNN) -- Aah, Christmas Eve. A time for family and friends, eggnog and mistletoe, carols and cookies ... and catching up on "Downton Abbey"?

Apparently, that's what legions of us had in mind when -- humbug! -- the Netflix Instant streaming service went down. The outage, caused when some Amazon servers used by Netflix crashed, lasted more than 20 hours.

Like many companies, Netflix pays to rent space on Amazon's massive banks of servers. The outage, which affected devices such as tablets and smartphones, began at about 3:30 p.m. ET Monday.

Many Netflix users had to scratch those plans to gather around the laptop for "It's a Wonderful Life," "A Christmas Story" or "Santa's Slay" (the 2005 classic starring former wrestler Bill Goldberg as a deranged Santa demon). Although for the desperate, "Shrek the Halls" was available on ABC.

Netflix said service was restored Christmas morning. "Special thanks to our awesome members for being patient. We're back to normal streaming levels. We hope everyone has a great holiday,' said the company on Twitter.

Still, the Internet was not amused -- which didn't stop some social-media users from trying to be amusing.
