(CNN) -- A tsunami advisory has been issued in Japan after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Japan's main island of Honshu, the Japan Meteorological Agency said Wednesday.

The quake was centered 169 kilometers (105 miles) off the east coast of Honshu, directly east of the city of Sendai, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

The quake occurred about 8.8 miles below the earth's surface, the USGS said. The expected height of the tsunami was only expected to be 0.5 meters (19.6 inches).

CNN correspondent Kyung Lah said she could feel the earthquake in Tokyo, 267 miles southwest of the quake's epicenter, and said the shaking lasted as long as three minutes, but that there was no significant damage.

TV Asahi showed video of boats rocking back and forth, as well as images taken from shaken city cams as the earthquake hit.

CNN's Kyung Lah in Tokyo contributed to this report.
