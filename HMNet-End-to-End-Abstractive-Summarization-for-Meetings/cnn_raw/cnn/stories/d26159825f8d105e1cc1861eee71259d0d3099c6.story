(CNN)Just as meteorologists feared, Tropical Cyclone Pam pummeled the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu. It is the strongest storm to make landfall, since the devastating Super Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines in 2013.

The government declared a state of emergency, as the death toll continues to rise. Thousands are in critical need of shelter, food and water -- including many children.  Aid workers on the ground are reporting massive destruction.

Vanuatu President Baldwin Lonsdale told CNN that the cyclone's destruction was the worst his country had ever experienced. He described the storm as a "monster."

Officials are reporting that 90% of the homes in the Vanuatu capital are damaged or destroyed. With communication still down between many of the islands, the  full extent of this storm's devastation is still unknown.
