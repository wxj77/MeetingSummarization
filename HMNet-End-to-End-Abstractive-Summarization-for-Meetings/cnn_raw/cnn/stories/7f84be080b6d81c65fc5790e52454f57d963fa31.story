(CNN) -- "7th Heaven" ended its run seven years ago, but the show's stars are still like family.

On Wednesday, Beverley Mitchell, who starred as Lucy Camden during the wholesome drama's 11-season run, shared a photo on WhoSay of herself dining with most of her fellow cast members.

The group, which beamed from ear-to-ear as they stood around a table filled with food and drinks, included Jessica Biel, who played Mary, David Gallagher (Simon); Stephen Collins (Rev. Eric Camden); Barry Watson (Matt); and Catherine Hicks (Annie).

Noticeably absent from the gathering was Mackenzie Rosman, who starred as the Camden family's youngest daughter, Ruthie.

"Something truly amazing happened last night and my heart is overflowing," Mitchell said in her WhoSay post. "Love these peeps more than I can ever explain! we were just missing Mack! Feeling so incredibly blessed to have these incredible people in my life!!! #theresnothinglikefamily #7thheaven #love #blessed"

When it premiered in 1996, "7th Heaven" helped put The WB on the map, becoming a signature show for the struggling network. Aaron Spelling executive produced the hit series, which followed a minister and his wife dealing with the challenges of raising seven children.

All of the cast continues to act, with Mitchell and Hicks most recently starring in the 2014 family film, "The Dog Who Saved Easter." Biel, who's gone on to star in numerous films and is now married to Justin Timberlake, had a high-profile guest role in the season 4 premiere of "New Girl" on September 16.

The final question on everyone's minds might be the whereabouts of the Camden family's dog, Happy. Sadly it seems the mixed terrier, which starred on "7th Heaven" throughout its 11 seasons, died in 2010 at the age of 15, according to IMDb.
