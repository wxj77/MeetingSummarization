(CNN) -- Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho will be banned for the next three Italian Serie A games following a gesture he made during Saturday's controversial 0-0 draw against Sampdoria.

League leaders Inter had two players sent off, while Sampdoria also had a man dismissed in a fiery encounter at the San Siro.

Is your boss a "Special One?"

Former Chelsea coach Mourinho was seen to cross his arms in the manner of being handcuffed -- a gesture aimed to suggest that Inter were being victimized by match officials -- after the first-half dismissals of defenders Ivan Cordoba and Walter Samuel.

Mourinho, who has also been handed a $55,000 fine for the gesture, is now bannded from the touchline for the matches against Udinese, Genoa and Catania as Inter try to hold off the challenge of a rampant Roma side at the top of the table.

To add to Inter's problems, Esteban Cambiasso and Sulley Muntari were handed two-game bans for their behavior towards match officials after the game, joining Samuel and Cordoba on the suspended list.

The controversy comes just 48 hours before Inter host Mourinho's former club Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League -- the first time he has come face-to-face with the Londoners since his dismissal in September 2007.
