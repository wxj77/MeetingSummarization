(CNN) -- Top seed Maria Sharapova survived a scare against Tsvetana Pironkova before securing her place in round three at Wimbledon.

Sharapova, whose first Grand Slam victory came at Wimbledon eight years ago, resumed at 7-6 3-1 after bad light had halted her progress on Wednesday.

But Bulgarian Pironkova quickly broke back and went on to level the match in a second-set tie break.

That was a wake-up call for the French Open champion, though, as Russian number one seed Sharapova took the deciding set 6-0.

"I started with no motor whatsoever. I was just on pause but I guess it's more important how you finish," Sharapova said.

Four-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams breezed through as she dismissed Melinda Czink 6-1 6-4 in less than an hour.

And it was a similarly comfortable passage for second seed Victoria Azarenka, as last year's semi-finalst eased through with a 6-2 6-0 win over Swiss Romina Oprandi.

There was a surprise defeat for 2007 finalist and ninth seed Marion Bartoli, who was beaten 6-4 6-3 by Croatia's Mirjana Lucic.

Eight seed Angelique Kerber beat Ekaterina Makarova 7-5 6-3 and will face Christina McHale in round three after the 28th seed beat Mathilde Johansson 7-5 7-5.

Former world number one Ana Ivanovic beat Kateryna Bondarenko 6-3 7-6 (7-3) and will now face German 22nd seed Julia Goerges.

But British hopes in the women's draw were extinguished as Anne Keothavong's hopes of reaching the third round for the first time were quickly dispatched by French Open finalist Sara Errani, who cruised to a 6-1 6-1 win.
