(PEOPLE.com) -- The wait is over ... it's a boy for Sarah Drew!

The "Grey's Anatomy" star, 31, delivered son Micah Emmanuel Lanfer at 6:21 p.m. Wednesday, January 18 in Los Angeles, her rep confirms to PEOPLE exclusively.

"She and her husband, Peter Lanfer, are in love with him!" the rep says of the couple's new baby boy, who weighed in at 7 pounds, 4 oz and is 19 inches long.

"I thought it would be a good idea to wait to find out because I am a control freak by nature," Drew explained of their decision to be surprised at the birth.

"I'm about to walk into a chapter of my life where I have no control over anything anymore, and I figured I'd ease myself into it by not allowing myself to plan for the sex of the baby. It's good training for me!"
