(EW.com) -- The guest cast for "Sons of Anarchy's" final season continues to grow.

Courtney Love, who earned a Golden Globe nomination for 1996â€²s "The People vs. Larry Flynt," will do a multi-episode arc as Jax's son Abel's preschool teacher, Ms. Harrison.

FX confirms she'll make her first appearance in season 7â€²s fourth episode and that the character's interest in Abel will rub his biological mother Wendy (series regular Drea de Matteo) the wrong way. TVLine first reported the casting.
