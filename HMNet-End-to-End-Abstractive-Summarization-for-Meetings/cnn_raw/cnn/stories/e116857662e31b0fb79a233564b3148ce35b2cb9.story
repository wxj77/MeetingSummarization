(EW.com) -- Sofia Vergara is about to be romantically linked to... Peter Griffin?

"The Modern Family" star will cameo as his fantasy love interest in an upcoming episode of "Family Guy," EW has learned. In a cutaway gag featuring Peter as a telenovela lothario, Vergara voices his sassy (and, yes, buxom) lover. And that's not her only role in the episode; she plays a woman selling roses in a restaurant where Quagmire is "wooing" Peter so that Peter will do him a big favor.

In addition, Vergara will pop up this season on another animated Fox comedy, "The Cleveland Show." She'll be voicing a character named Tia Sofia, who tries to talk Cleveland into hosting a quinceaÃ±era for Cleveland Jr.'s 15th birthday.

"Family Guy's" 11th season, which kicks off Sept. 30, also boasts contributions from Johnny Depp, Ryan Reynolds, Elizabeth Banks, and Kellan Lutz. Meanwhile, "Cleveland's" season 4 premiere airs Oct. 7, and the hip hop-themed episode showcases the voices of Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Bruno Mars, will.i.a.m, and ?uestlove.
