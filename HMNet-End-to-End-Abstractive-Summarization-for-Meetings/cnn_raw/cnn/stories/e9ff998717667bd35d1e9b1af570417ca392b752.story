(CNN)U2 lead singer Bono is not having a good month. Days after a rear hatch flew off his aircraft midair, a bicycle accident in New York landed him in an operating room this week.

It turns out his injuries were not minor.

The singer had a "high-energy bicycle accident" when he tried to avoid another rider Sunday at Central Park, according to New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, where he was treated. The hospital released  details on his injuries for the first time Wednesday night.

Bono underwent hours of multiple surgeries after the accident, it said.

He broke his arm in six spots, fractured his eye socket and also his shoulder blade -- the latter in three places, according to Dr. Dean Lorich,  a trauma surgeon at the hospital.

Doctors operated on him for five hours Sunday, which included repairing his bone with three metal plates and 18 screws,  Lorich said in a statement.

A day later, he had surgery on his left hand to repair a fracture.

"He will require intensive and progressive therapy. However, a full recovery is expected," the doctor said.

Bono's mishaps this month could have been much worse.

The rear hatch of his aircraft dropped off midflight on his way from Dublin to Berlin on November 13.

The ground crew discovered the hatch was missing shortly after the plane landed. Two suitcases flew out, but all six people aboard were fine.
