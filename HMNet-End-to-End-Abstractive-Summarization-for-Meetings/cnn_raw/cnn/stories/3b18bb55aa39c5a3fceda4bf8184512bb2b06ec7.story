Searching living rooms and closets for your eggs may be fun the first six times, but if the novelty's wearing thinner than a chocolate egg's foil wrapping, there are more adventurous egg trails out there.

Imperial Easter Nest Hunt (Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna)

For a traditional hunt, Austria's beautiful Schönbrunn Palace serves as the backdrop for the annual Easter market.

The highlight is an Easter egg hunt, but there are also workshops in marzipan sculpting and flower arranging.

Kids over 20 might enjoy the craft stalls and live jazz.

The Old Vienna Easter market, a short walk away, is equally worth a visit -- if only to see the enormous mountain of 40,000 painted Easter eggs.

Bad Eggs Easter Egg Hunt, the London Dungeon (London)

Fed up with cute bunnies and sickly sweet chocolate?

The egg concealed in the plague room might be covered in leeches; you might spot a fuse sticking out of the egg hidden in the area dedicated to Guy Fawkes.

All participants get an Easter-themed sweet treat and a chance to win theme park passes.

The Big Egg Hunt NYC presented by Fabergé (New York)

More than 200 egg sculptures dotted around New York's five boroughs have been designed by famous artists and designers, including Tommy Hilfiger and Caroline Herrera.

Participants must first download The Big Egg Hunt NYC app, which provides clues related to locations of the spectacular, super-sized eggs.

Codes displayed on eggs are used to enter a drawing for the chance to win one of three $48,000 Fabergé pendants.

And, no, we don't know how much that would sell for on eBay.
