(CNN) -- The firefighter who accidentally ran over and killed a 16-year-old girl who survived July's Asiana Airlines crash in San Francisco will not be charged in the case, San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said Friday.

The decision comes more than two weeks after authorities completed their investigation into the incident.

A California coroner ruled that Ye Mengyuan of China was alive when she was flung from the plane that crashed as it landed short of the runway at San Francisco International Airport on July 6, but was killed by "multiple blunt injuries" moments later when run over by a rescue vehicle.

That month, San Francisco Fire Department Chief Joanne Hayes-White called the girl's death "a tragic accident" and apologized to Ye's family.

"Obviously this is very difficult news for us. We're heartbroken. We're in the business of saving lives," Hayes-White said at the time. "There's not a lot of words to describe how badly we feel about it."

Two other people died as a result of the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214. More than 180 people aboard the flight were injured.
