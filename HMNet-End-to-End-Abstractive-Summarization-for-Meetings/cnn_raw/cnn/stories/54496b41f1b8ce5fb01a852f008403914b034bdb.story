Los Angeles (CNN) -- "Barefoot Bandit" Colton Harris-Moore has sold the movie rights to his life story to 20th Century Fox, a studio spokesman said Thursday.

The Fox spokesman, however, said reports the studio paid $1.3 million for the right were "highly exaggerated."

Harris-Moore, 20, was a teenager when he took a two-year joy ride running from the cops, which ended last year with his arrest in the Bahamas.

As part of a plea deal, Harris-Moore agreed to give up any profits that may come from book or movie deals on his story.

His attorney, John Henry Browne, has said his client wants any such money to go to the victims. Harris-Moore is estimated to owe more than $1.4 million in restitution.

Harris-Moore led law enforcement on a wild ride across nine states and three countries. He stole, flew and crashed five airplanes.

His final journey took him across eight states, leaving behind a trail of home and business break-ins and stolen cars.

Surveillance video shows him taking off in a stolen plane from Bloomington, Indiana, heading to the Bahamas. Harris-Moore lasted a few more days before police stopped him by shooting up a stolen boat while Harris-Moore was stuck on a sand bar.

Harris-Moore's plea deal is expected to result in a 10-year prison term when he is sentenced in late October. He also faces an assortment of state charges.

CNN's Ted Rowlands and Matthew Carey contributed to this report.
