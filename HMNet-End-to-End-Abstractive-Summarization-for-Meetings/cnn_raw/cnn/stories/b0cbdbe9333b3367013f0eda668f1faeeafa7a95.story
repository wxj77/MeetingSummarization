(CNN) -- As the oldest major tennis championship, Wimbledon can boast a heritage and tradition second to none.

After 133 years of action at the All England club in south-west London, there are many memorable moments to choose from, and CNN World Sport has selected its top 10.

Not necessarily dictated by the on-court action, our list incorporates the ridiculous as well as the sublime, the embarrassing alongside the triumphant.

A host of the tournament's best-loved players are in there, from John McEnroe to Boris Becker, Virginia Wade to Jana Novotna, as well as some lesser-known faces, like that of the Centre Court's first streaker in 1996.
