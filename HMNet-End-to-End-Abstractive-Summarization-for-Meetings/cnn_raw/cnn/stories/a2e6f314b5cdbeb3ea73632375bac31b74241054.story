Jimmy Kimmel got us again.

Did you see the video of the Russian wolf that was supposed to have been roaming the hallways of the Olympic Village?

One word: Fake.

Kimmel admitted the prank on his late night TV show, saying his crew filmed the American wolf and got permission from Kate Hansen, a member of the U.S. luge team, to post it on her Twitter and YouTube accounts.

"I'm pretty sure this is a wolf wandering my hall in Sochi," her tweet said.  More than 1.7 million people have checked out the video.

Both Hansen and the wolf appeared on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on Thursday night.

Hansen said the video created a bit of a stir in the Olympic Village.

"Security started freaking out, because technically it was a breach. You know, athlete safety," Hansen told Kimmel via Skype from Sochi.  "It kind of went a little crazy here."

By the way, the wolf is named Rugby and he's an American timberwolf mix, according to his trainer in Los Angeles.  Folks online were speculating that he was possibly a husky or German Shepherd mix.

This isn't the first time Kimmel has pulled the wolf over our eyes.

Remember the twerking stunt back in September, right after Miley Cyrus showed us her moves on the VMAs

A woman who was twerking upside down in what appeared to be her living room takes a tumble when surprised by her roommate.  She crashes into a coffee table, knocks over some candles and sets her pants on fire.

Yes, Kimmel did that one too.

For her help with his latest stunt, Kimmel awarded Hansen a gold medal for pranking.  No word yet on what Russian officials have in mind for her.

After fooling millions of folks on TV and the Internet again, maybe it's Kimmel who's the wolf -- in sheep's clothing.
