A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck about four miles from the coastal city of Sechura in northern Peru on Saturday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

No damage or injuries were reported in the quake, which happened at a depth of six miles.

The quake happened in a region that marks the boundary between two tectonic plates, where the oceanic crust of the Nazca Plate moves under the South American Plate. These subduction zones are often the sites of volcanic activity and earthquakes.
