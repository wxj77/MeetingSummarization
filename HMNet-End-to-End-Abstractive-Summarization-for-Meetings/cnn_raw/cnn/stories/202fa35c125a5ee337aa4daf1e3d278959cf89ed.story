Dawu, Taiwan (CNN) -- Typhoon Nanmadol pounded Taiwan with heavy rains Monday before it was downgraded to a tropical storm and headed toward China.

The storm made landfall in the southern portion of Taiwan about 3 a.m. Monday, dousing some areas with up to 300 mm (11 inches) of rain, officials said.

There were no immediate reports of casualties, although officials closed several highways in the landslide-prone region.

Nanmadol reached Taiwan after pummeling the Philippines over the weekend. By Monday, the death toll in the Philippines had climbed to 12.

Among them were two children who died when Nanmadol, known locally as Mina, triggered a landslide in northern Philippines on Saturday, authorities said.

The landslide buried the victims in Pangasinan province, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.

Ten others were killed in different incidents, 21 people were injured, and nine remain missing, the council said in a statement Monday.
