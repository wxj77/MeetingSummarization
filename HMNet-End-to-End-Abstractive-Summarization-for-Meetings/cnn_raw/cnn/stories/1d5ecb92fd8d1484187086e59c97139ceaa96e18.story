(CNN) -- Australian Samantha Stosur made a strong start to the defense of her U.S. Open crown with a crushing opening victory at Flushing Meadows.

Her Croatian opponent Petra Matric won just two games as the seventh seed marched to a 6-1 6-1triumph in just 51 minutes.

Stosur won the first grand slam title of her career in New York last year, beating home-crowd favorite Serena Williams in the final.

The 28-year-old will now face Edina Gallovits-Hall, an unseeded Romanian who has won through to the second round of year's final major for the first time.

Speaking after the match, Stosur explained how being away from home has helped her game.

"You're in the spotlight a bit more back home and you see yourself on TV and the newspapers even if you're not looking for it," the 28-year-old told reporters. "It's unavoidable, whereas here there are other players that are in that spotlight instead."
