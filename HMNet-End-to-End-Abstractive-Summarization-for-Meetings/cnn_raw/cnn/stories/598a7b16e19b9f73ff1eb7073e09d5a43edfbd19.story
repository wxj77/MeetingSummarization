(CNN) -- Celebrity publicist Max Clifford was charged Friday with 11 counts of indecent assault against a girl under the age of 16 as part of an investigation into sex abuse allegations against the late British TV presenter Jimmy Savile, according to the Metropolitan Police Service.

Clifford was arrested in December on suspicion of sex offenses in connection with the investigation -- dubbed Operation Yewtree -- into numerous allegations made against Savile and others following a documentary that aired in October.

In the documentary, several people came forward alleging Savile abused them.

The charges against Clifford, who has previously said the claims were "totally untrue," include allegations of sex abuse that date between 1966 and 1985, the police said in a statement.

Clifford has been ordered to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 28 to answer the charges.

Police set up Operation Yewtree to investigate sexual abuse claims after a documentary by broadcaster ITV in October unleashed a flood of allegations against the star, who before that was seen primarily as an eccentric but charismatic man who raised millions of pounds for charity.

The investigation has three strands, one involving claims against just Savile, another involving "Savile and others," and the third involving only "others."

The earliest claim against Savile dates back to 1955 and the latest from 2009, when he was in his 80s.

Savile, a popular BBC television personality with his trademark white-blonde hair, was the face of the shows "Top of the Pops" and "Jim'll Fix It." He died in 2011.

CNN's Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.
