(CNN) -- Air Asia, in its current incarnation as a low fare, no frills concept launched in December 2001.

Today the airline flies to over 48 destinations in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Macau, China, Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar, and has formed two successful joint ventures -- in Thailand through Thai Air asia, and Indonesia through Indonesia Air asia.

When it started the operator had just two planes, but now it has expanded its fleet to 28.

To date the Air asia group, has carried over 35 million guests.

In August 2003, Air asia became the first airline in the world to introduce SMS booking where guests can book their seats, check flight schedules and obtain latest updates on Air asia promotions from the convenience of their mobile phones.

In Jan 2004, Air asia carved a milestone in the history of Asian aviation when the low fare airline formed a partnership with Shin Corporation in Thailand to develop a low fare carrier in Thailand.

In July 2004, the low fare airline commenced service to the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Macau, by introducing a flight via is Thai operations from Bangkok.

In April 2005, the Air asia Group became the first low fare, no frills airline to commence services between Bangkok and Xiamen, in China, and Clark (the Philippines) from Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu.

In line with its growth and expansion plans, Air asia has secured a 130 aircraft commitment with Airbus for its A320s (100 firm, 30 options). The 130 aircraft order will place Air asia as the single largest customer for the aircraft in Asia-Pacific, and potentially one of the largest airline fleets in the region. The new aircraft would gradually replaced Air asia's existing Boeing 737-300s.
