(EW.com ) -- Maria Bello will star in a Lifetime movie adaptation of Stephen King's horror novella "Big Driver." The movie will also star Olympia Dukakis, Grammy nominee Joan Jett, and Will Harris ("Sky High"). This project is the first collaboration between King and Lifetime.

First published as a novella within King's acclaimed 2010 collection "Full Dark, No Stars" (an excerpt of which was published in EW), the story follows Tess Thorne (Bello), a mystery and thriller writer who gets stranded while driving at night in New England and then repeatedly assaulted by the man who rescues her. Thorne, left for dead with the bodies of her rescuer's murder victims, manages to get home safely, but finds herself obsessed with exacting revenge.

Dukakis will play a character named Doreen, while Jett will play one named Betsy Neal. "Big Driver" will premiere this fall.
