(CNN) -- Acclaimed director Clint Eastwood and singer Beyonce Knowles may team up in a remake of "A Star Is Born," a Warner Bros. official said.

Eastwood, the entertainment icon known for his gruff portrayals, is in talks to direct the 1937 classic, a Warner Bros. spokeswoman said. And Knowles is in negotiations to star in the film.

There has been no date set for the launch of the movie which explores the relationship between a Hollywood starlet and an older aging actor.

In 1937, Janet Gaynor and Fredric March starred in the film. Judy Garland and James Mason starred in a remake in 1954. Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson starred in another remake in 1976.

A hugely successful recording star, Knowles also is no stranger to the big screen.

She starred in the movie "Dreamgirls" in 2006 and portrayed legendary singer Etta James in the 2008 film "Cadillac Records."
