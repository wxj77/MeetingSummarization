(CNN) -- After a hole-in-one at the KLM Open in Amsterdam, golfer Andy Sullivan has won a prize that is truly out of this world.

The Englishman, who found the cup with his tee shot on the 15th hole, bagged himself a flight into space courtesy of a Dutch aerospace company.

XCOR Aerospace pledged a 62-minute space flight to any player who could card a hole-in-one at the 15th at the Kennemer Golf and Country Club.

The trip is valued at between $95,000 and $115,000.

"My caddie just shouted to me, 'we're going to space'. I was in hysterics. It's just an unreal experience. I didn't play great through the round and then I hit a shot like that," Sullivan told the European Tour's official website.

Before boldly going where no professional golfer has gone before, Sullivan needs to run the idea by his wife.

"I'm not sure if I'll go, I'll check with the missus," said Sullivan. "I'm not great with heights or flying! I might have to pluck up some coverage. I don't think spaceman is a new nickname for me.

"My daughter will think I'm the best dad in the world -- a professional golfer and an astronaut, she's got the best dad in the world! I'm going to have to pluck up some serious courage, but it is a once in a lifetime experience, so I'm going to have to do it."
