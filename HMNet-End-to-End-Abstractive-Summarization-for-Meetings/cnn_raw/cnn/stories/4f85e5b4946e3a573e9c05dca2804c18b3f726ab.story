Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Amanda Bynes has been charged with two misdemeanor hit-and-run counts, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles city attorney's office said Wednesday.

The 26-year-old star was allegedly involved in incidents on April 10 and August 4.

The charges follow an April 6 incident in which Bynes was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence after her vehicle allegedly struck an officer's vehicle. She pleaded not guilty in that case, according to reports.

At the time, her father, Rick Bynes, told People magazine that the actress hadn't been drinking.

If convicted on the hit-and-run charges, the "Easy A" star faces a maximum sentence of up to six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine for each count, said city attorney spokesman Frank Mateljan. The charges were filed Tuesday.

Bynes, who starred in the TV series "What I Like About You," is due in Van Nuys Superior Court on September 27.

Bynes' representatives did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
