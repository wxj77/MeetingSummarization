(CNN) -- A broken-down freighter and its tow ship finally reached safety in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on Tuesday afternoon, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.

Chief Petty Officer Dana Warr said Monday the disabled Golden Seas and the tow vessel Tor Viking II had to travel about 150 nautical miles (172 miles) despite being just 30 miles south of the harbor as of Monday afternoon.

That's because the ships had to pass through a safe shipping lane that required them to travel northeast, then cut back west and ultimately south before entering the harbor, Warr said. The captain of the tug boat decided to take a longer route because of the rough seas, including up to 25- foot waves.

The 738-foot Golden Seas was traveling from Vancouver, British Columbia, to the United Arab Emirates when it suffered engine trouble Friday morning off Alaska's remote Aleutian Islands. The vessel was unable to power through rough waves and was in danger of running aground.

The ship is carrying canola seed used for making canola oil as well as more than 450,000 gallons of crude oil, 11,700 gallons of diesel fuel and 10,000 gallons of lube oil. It is owned by the Greek company Allseas Marine.

According to a situation report released Monday from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, several islands along the Golden Seas' route to Dutch Harbor "may be vulnerable to a potential spill," but no spill has occurred.

The Tor Viking II reached the ship on Saturday and began towing it toward Dutch Harbor.

CNN's Rick Martin and Michael Martinez contibuted to this report.
