(CNN) -- If you believe the Mayas, the end of the world is near. At least that's how some people have interpreted the fact that when the Mesoamericans conceived their Long Count calendar more than 5,000 years ago, it happened to stop at December 21, 2012.

Others believe the end of the Maya calendar simply refers to the coming of a major global physical or spiritual transmogrification, marking the start of a new era. Whichever camp you fall into, if you don't want to be sitting at home in your recliner when the big day comes, consider heading to one of the many hotels that are marking the date with special Maya-themed deals and packages. We've highlighted a handful of examples both in the heart of Maya country and beyond.

Mexico and Central America

Fairmont Mayakoba and Rosewood Mayakoba
Playa del Carmen, Mexico

These sister properties on the beautiful Riviera Maya are honoring the Maya civilization's rich culture with several packages featuring special spa treatments (think healing herbs and bathing rituals), authentic tasting menus (showcasing ingredients such as yucca, verdolaga and chayote) and other on-property events (traditional music and dance, lectures, etc.).

After you've perfected your downward facing dog, join the beach party commemorating the conclusion of the Maya calendar on December 21.

Denver
Book by December 11

If the world is going to end, why not go out with a bang? That's the thinking behind the "Party Like There's No To-Maya" package at this trendy downtown Denver lodging. For a one-time offering, interested parties can rent out the entire 15th floor (26 rooms) on December 21 for a blowout with all of their friends and family. In addition to food and drink, you get limousine transport for all of your guests, the services of a professional tattoo artist, an in-room amenity kit with gas masks, anti-radiation tablets and freeze-dried food, and, just in case you make it through the night, free breakfast at the onsite restaurant the following morning.

Hotel Maya
Long Beach, California
Ongoing

This chic waterfront hotel doesn't have to do much to mark the occasion, because, as its name implies, it already embraces Maya culture -- from the vibrant color scheme to menu items at its onsite restaurant. The hotel is, however, running a yearlong "The Year to Go Mayan" sweepstakes that offer entrants the chance to win free weekend stays as well as a grand prize trip to the heart of Maya country in Yucatan, Mexico. Other special offerings include a themed dinner show, complete with authentic music and cuisine, on November 14 as well as an End of the World Party on December 21. You can even track the remaining time on the Maya calendar, down to the day, hour, minute and second, on the hotel's website.
