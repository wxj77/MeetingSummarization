(CNN)A senior commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Syria over the weekend, Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency reported.

Gen. Mohammed Ali Allahdadi was killed in the same Sunday airstrike that killed six others during a field inspection in Quneitra, a Hezbollah statement said.

The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the strike.

The son of a late Hezbollah commander was also killed in the airstrike, Hezbollah said.

Jihad Mughniyeh, the son of Imad Mughniyeh, was born in 1989. His father was assassinated in Syria in 2008.

According to a statement from the Lebanon-based militant group, a group was doing a field inspection in Quneitra when a helicopter opened fire.

CNN's Amir Daftari, Hamdi Alkhshali and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.
