(CNN)It doesn't tell us much, but a new trailer for season five of "The Walking Dead" raises a few questions.

Who -- or what -- will be the gang's next big foe? What, exactly, is "all that matters"? Where's Carl?

It's enough to get fans psyched for the mid-season premiere on February 8.

AMC's zombie apocalypse thriller took a break in November after killing off one of the main characters.

Otherwise, Rick and the surviving members of his crew are back together, apparently, roaming foggy woods, in pursuit of an unidentified enemy, if the trailer is any indication.

Who do you think will be the next character to meet his or her demise? Tell us on CNN Facebook.
