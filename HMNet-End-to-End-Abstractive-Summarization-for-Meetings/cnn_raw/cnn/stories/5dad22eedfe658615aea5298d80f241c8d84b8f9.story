Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress and animal rights activist Eva Mendes hopes you'll shun fur as you shop for the holidays.

"Even if you buy a fur glove with the little trim, and you think 'Oh, my God, it's just a little trim,' that animal got clubbed," Mendes said.

Mendes took her clothes off two years ago for the PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) "Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" campaign, but now she wants you to see something less pleasant. She's narrated a video of PETA's latest undercover footage of animals being killed for their fur.

"These animals are beaten to death, they're skinned alive, their throats are slashed while they're still alive," she said. "They're anally electrocuted, just so the fur won't become tainted."

It's unlikely you'll see the 3-minute video on television because of its gruesome nature. But it shouldn't be hard to find it spreading virally online.

"It's not something you want to see," she said. "But it's something you have to see."

Mendes says she's confident that anyone who watches it will eventually ditch furs as fashion.

"Even if you don't do something today, it'll stay in your consciousness and you'll think about it," she said. "That's why these strong images are so necessary for people to see, because they'll stay in your mind, and maybe in your subconscious. They'll stay there and that will really help you make a more evolved decision in the future."

Mendes said her dog, Hugo, "changed her world" and convinced her to campaign against fur.

"I've become so much of a more just sensitive, empathetic person towards animals because of him," she said. "Because he's just so precious and I can't imagine wearing him or eating him, and what's really the difference between him or some little raccoon or some bunny or seal?"

Mendes stopped eating beef, chicken and pork two years ago, but she still consumes animal products such as cheese and milk.

But there is a great substitute for animal fur, she said.

"Go faux, go fake."
