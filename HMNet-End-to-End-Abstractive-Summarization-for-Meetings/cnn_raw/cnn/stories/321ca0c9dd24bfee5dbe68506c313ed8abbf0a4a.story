New Orleans (CNN) -- New Orleans police arrested a second suspect in the Mother's Day shooting that wounded 19 people this week, including three still in critical condition, authorities said Thursday.

The two suspects are believed to be involved in gangs, police said. No further details were immediately available, authorities said.

Meanwhile, the first suspect, Akein Scott, 19, is facing 20 counts of attempted second-degree murder in the Sunday shooting, and his bail was set at $10 million during his first appearance in Orleans Parish Magistrate Court on Thursday morning, court records said.

Scott's next hearing is scheduled for July 16.

Among the three people still in critical condition from the shooting is a reporter, police said.

A SWAT team was used during Scott's arrest Wednesday night in east New Orleans, CNN affiliate WDSU reported.

Police identified Scott as a suspect Monday after footage of the shooting was released.

Images of the parade, released by police Monday, show a man standing at the outskirts of a packed parade route. A moment later, he charges toward the crowd.

The surveillance camera images show the panicked crowd scrambling for cover. The man runs away, leaving people and bicycles scattered on the ground behind him.

A $10,000 reward was offered in the case.

The shooting, during a festive Mother's Day parade, renewed concerns about crime in the city.

It was the third holiday this year when guns have been fired into crowds, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said.

A January 21 shooting near a Martin Luther King Day parade left five wounded. Four people were hurt in a February Mardi Gras attack, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported.

CNN's Chandler Friedman and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.
