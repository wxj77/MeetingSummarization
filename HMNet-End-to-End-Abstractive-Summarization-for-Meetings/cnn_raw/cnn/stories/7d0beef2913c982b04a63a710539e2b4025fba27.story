Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suspected U.S. drone strike killed 16 people and wounded six Thursday in one of Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal regions, two officials said.

The attack, which included four missiles, targeted a compound on the border of Orakzai Agency and North Waziristan, a local government official and a military official said.

The compound belonged to Maulvi Shakirullah, a militant affiliated with the Haqqani network, the officials said.

The network is widely viewed to be fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan

Pakistan's Geo TV, a CNN affiliate, also reported that the drone "fired four missiles at a madrasa," or seminary, run by Shakirullah.

A previous drone strike in the Orakzai agency in 2009 killed 11 suspected militants from a faction of the Pakistani Taliban.

The United States carries out drone strikes in Pakistan aimed at dismantling terror operations, but generally does not comment on them.
