(CNN) -- The Cincinnati Reds' Homer Bailey added to his squad's storybook season -- and to baseball pitchers' remarkable run this year -- by tossing a no-hitter on Friday night.

The Reds starter shut down the Pittsburgh Pirates by a 1-0 score, tossing 115 pitches and striking out 10 batters in the process.

The lone blemishes that prevented him from earning a perfect game were a third-inning error and a walk in the seventh inning.

Seven no-hitters have been thrown in the Major Leagues this season. That ties for the most in any year -- with 1990 and 1991 -- according to info posted on MLB.com, the league's official website.

It is Cincinnati's first no-hitter since Tom Browning shut down the L.A. Dodgers, also by a 1-0 score, in 1988.

The win in Pittsburgh gave the Reds yet another reason to celebrate.

Over a week ago, Cincinnati clinched a playoff berth and then the National League Central Division title. The Reds have the second-best record in the majors, just percentage points behind the Washington Nationals.
