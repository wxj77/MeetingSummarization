New York (CNN) -- A former on-air meteorologist for New York's WABC-TV has pleaded guilty to charges of filing a phony attempted sexual assault report, a story she later recanted.

Heidi Jones pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of false reporting in the third degree, her attorney, Paul Callan, said Wednesday.

Jones, who did weather reports on the station's weekend newscasts, called police on November 24, 2010, saying that she had nearly been attacked while jogging in Central Park.

She said that on November 21 she had crossed paths with a man, whom she described as a Hispanic in his 30s, who taunted and harassed her.

Police said Jones later recanted the story as police questioned her. After she was arrested and charged in December, she was suspended by WABC and later resigned.

Before Wednesday's guilty plea, Callan filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that Jones was denied her right to a speedy trial. State Supreme Court Justice Richard Carruthers denied the motion.

While sentencing is scheduled for October 26, the defendant and the district attorney's office said they have agreed on a sentence of three years probation with 350 hours of community service.

Assistant District Attorney Shanda Strain said in court that the number of hours of community service was based on the number of hours law enforcement officials spent investigating the case, said Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.

Callan said that Jones "wished to express her sincere apologies for any problems caused by her and by this incident and she specifically apologized to the NYPD and other law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation."

He added, "Heidi Jones has always sought a way to accept personal responsibility for the unfortunate actions"
