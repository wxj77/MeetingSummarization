(CNN) -- A Guatemalan man accused in five rapes in Palm Beach County, Florida, has been extradited to the United States to face charges, officials announced Thursday.

DNA evidence linked the suspect to the five victims, said Capt. Carol Gregg of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Baltazar Gabriel Delgado Ros was extradited Wednesday after Palm Beach investigators worked to bring him back to the United States.

Delgado Ros had moved back to Guatemala after trying to change his physical appearance with a close-cropped haircut, Gregg said.

In 2011, he was arrested in Guatemala on charges in the attempted rape of a minor, Gregg said.

The Florida rapes took place between April 2009 and September 2011.
