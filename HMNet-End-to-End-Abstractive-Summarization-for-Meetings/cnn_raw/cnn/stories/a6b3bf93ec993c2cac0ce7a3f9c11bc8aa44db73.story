(CNN) -- Patti Stanger, the star of Bravo's "The Millionaire Matchmaker," issued an apology for saying gay men have difficulty staying monogamous.

She made the comments on another Bravo show "Watch What Happens Live," which aired Sunday.

In response to a caller who wanted to know if long-distance, open relationships are possible, Stanger said, "In the gay world, there's always going to be open (relationships). ... There is no curbing the gay."

She asked the caller if he was gay. When he said yes, Stanger said, "I've tried to curb you people."

Stanger's apology came via her Twitter account the next day, following a firestorm of negative comments online.

"Attn male Gays: I support you," she said. "So sorry -- didn't mean to offend anyone. Love you all. X0."

On HLN's "The Joy Behar Show," Stanger said she apologizes if GLAAD -- the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation -- was offended and then touted her record of support for gay dating and marriage during the five years of her matchmaker show.

The apology did not sit well with many.

"'I didn't mean to offend you' â‰  'What I said was bigoted and wrong,'" Matt Algren of Dayton, Ohio, tweeted, while another post said: "More homophobic generalizations. Just stop girl. You're done."
