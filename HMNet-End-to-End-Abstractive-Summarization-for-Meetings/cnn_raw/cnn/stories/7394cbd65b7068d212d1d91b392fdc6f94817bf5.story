(CNN Student News) -- October 16, 2014

Economics, epidemiology, meteorology, and genealogy are all part of this Thursday's show. We cover elements of fear, from how it's driving stock prices down to how it's outpacing the spread of the Ebola virus. We cover California's drought, from how it's impacting farmers to how people are coping with water limits. And we trace the roots of a CNN anchor.
