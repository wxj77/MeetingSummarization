(CNN) -- "Birdman" is flying high.

The Michael Keaton film, about a former superhero-playing actor who tries to revive his career with a Broadway show, earned six Independent Spirit Awards nominations Tuesday, including best feature, best director (Alejandro G. Inarritu) and best actor for Keaton.

The other nominees for best feature are "Boyhood," "Love Is Strange," "Selma" and "Whiplash."

Three films earned five nominations -- "Boyhood," "Selma" and "Nightcrawler" -- and two earned four: "Whiplash" and "Love Is Strange."

Though not necessarily an Oscar indicator, getting picked by the Independent Spirit Awards -- which are open to American films with budgets below $20 million -- doesn't hurt in creating awards season buzz, and many do go on to win the big trophy. In fact, as GoldDerby.com observed, several of last year's Independent Spirit winners -- including Matthew McConaughey ("Dallas Buyers Club"), Cate Blanchett ("Blue Jasmine"), Jared Leto ("Dallas Buyers Club") and Lupita Nyong'o ("12 Years a Slave") -- went on to win Oscars in their respective categories.

And the Oscar for best picture went to "12 Years a Slave," which was also named best feature at the Independent Spirit Awards.

"Boyhood," the Richard Linklater-directed film that follows a boy for a dozen years as he grows up, is considered a strong contender for best picture this year.

The 30th Independent Spirit Awards are scheduled for Saturday, February 21, the day before the Oscars.
