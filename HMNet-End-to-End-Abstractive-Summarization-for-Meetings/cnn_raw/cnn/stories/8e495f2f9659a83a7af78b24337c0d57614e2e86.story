The PlayStation gaming console wrapped up its second decade on Wednesday, and Sony celebrated by looking to the past.

The Japanese tech giant announced that a limited edition 20th Anniversary PlayStation 4 will be released soon. The console will be gray, like the first PlayStation released December 3, 1994 in Japan. It will include other imagery like the iconic four-color PlayStation logo that harks back to the system's history.

"The mid-'90s were an exciting time for game developers, driven by the explosion of powerful but affordable 3-D graphics rendering hardware and the birth of many young and adventurous development studios," Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, wrote in the post on the PlayStation blog. "The original PlayStation was meant to embody that sense of adventure and discovery, that sense that anything was possible."

The PlayStation sold a then unheard-of 100,000 units in its first weekend and hit 1 million units in six months, according to Sony.

Only 12,300 units of the 20th Anniversary PS4 will be released, according to a video on the blog post. Pre-orders will begin Saturday, and details about how to vie for one of the handful of slots will come during a keynote presentation from PlayStation Experience, a fan and developer expo being held in Las Vegas.

The keynote will be Saturday at 1 p.m. ET.
