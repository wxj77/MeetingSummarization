(CNN) -- Fernando Verdasco denied fellow Spaniard David Ferrer a third successive final appearance at the Barcelona Open after coming from behind to win a tense last-four clash on Saturday.

Fifth seed Verdasco, the losing finalist last weekend in Monte Carlo, triumphed 6-7 (3-7) 7-5 6-1 to set up a title showdown with second seed Robin Soderling on Sunday.

Verdasco was a break down as he trailed 4-3 in the second set, but battled back to win in more than two and half hours in the claycourt event.

Ferrer had been hoping to make up for his past two final defeats against Rafael Nadal, who opted to rest this week after crushing Verdasco to win a record-equaling sixth title in Monte Carlo, but the eighth seed was soon 5-0 down in the decider.

Verdasco is through to his third final this year, having won the SAP Open tournament in San Jose in February.

The 26-year-old has won only once in five meetings with Soderling, who crushed young Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker 6-1 6-4 in Saturday's second semifinal.

The Swede needed just one hour and 16 minutes to end the challenge of the 21-year-old, who fought back to make the scoreline respectable after trailing 4-0 in the second set.

De Bakker, who has risen to a career-high 67th in the world rankings this month, upset third seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarterfinals to follow up his earlier win over clay specialist and former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero.
