(CNN)Beantown vs. the Emerald City. Snow vs. rain. Tea vs. coffee.

Why wait for the Super Bowl? Let's start the Boston-Seattle smack talk now.

Sunday's preeminent football game is more than just the Patriots against the Seahawks. It also pits two northern coastal cities against each other in a clash of cultures: East vs. West, Pilgrims vs. loggers, tweed vs. flannel, "wicked pissah" vs. "hey, the mountain is out."

Which burg is better? We've come up with a highly unscientific scorecard.

Let's break it down:

Sure, the Boston Tea Party helped free us from British rule and all, but how could we survive without our daily coffee?

Score: Seattle 1, Boston 0

No contest here.

Score: Seattle 1, Boston 1

"Singles," that ode to Seattle's early-'90s grunge scene, hasn't aged as well as the Matt Damon-Robin Williams bromance. How do you like them apples?

Score: Boston 2, Seattle 1

They're both worthy, but Nirvana may be the most influential rock band of the past 25 years.

Score: Boston 2, Seattle 2

Junior was amazing, but he never hit .406.

Score: Boston 3, Seattle 2

What would you rather listen to: someone shouting "the British are coming!" or "Purple Haze"?

Score: Boston 3, Seattle 3

Baked beans are tasty. But they never led the NBA in scoring, won an MVP award and brought tears to the eyes of moms everywhere.

Score: Seattle 4, Boston 3

Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name.

Score: Seattle 4, Boston 4

Once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River, the 605-foot-tall Space Needle is built to withstand winds of up to 200 miles per hour and has a revolving restaurant on top with views of Mount Rainier. The Bunker Hill Monument has 294 steps.

Score: Seattle 5, Boston 4

I like big butts and I cannot lie.

Score: Seattle 6, Boston 4

Harvard gave us Teddy Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Henry David Thoreau and Neil deGrasse Tyson. Microsoft gave us Windows Vista.

Score: Seattle 6, Boston 5

Both cities serve a mean clam/fish chowder, but let's be honest: Boston's is the original -- and more fun to pronounce. Get your chowdah heah!

Score: Seattle 6, Boston 6

Four months after it opened to traffic in 1940, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed in 40-mph winds. But Bill Buckner and the infamous '86 Red Sox were one strike away from winning the World Series.

Boston 7, Seattle 6

By our scoring, venerable Boston comes out on top -- barely -- over its upstart West Coast rival. Let's hope the actual Super Bowl is this close.
