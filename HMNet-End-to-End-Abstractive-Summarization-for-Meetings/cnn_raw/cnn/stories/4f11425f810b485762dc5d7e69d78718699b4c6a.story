(CNN) -- Harry Carey Jr. worked in the golden era of Western movies, rubbing elbows -- or chaps -- with many of the the genre's legends, including actors John Wayne and Ben Johnson and directors John Ford and Howard Hawks.

The red-haired character actor, who appeared in about 100 films, died Thursday at 91, his website said

Carey, whose parents were actors, made 10 films with Wayne, including "Red River," "The Searchers" and "Cahill U.S. Marshall," according to a Hollywood Walk of Fame biography.

Other films included "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," "Rio Bravo" and "3 Godfathers."

The California native served in the U.S. Navy in World War II and tried his hand at singing before moving to acting, according to the Internet Movie Database.

In addition to his wealth of film appearances, Carey appeared on nearly 100 television programs, including "The Adventures of Spin and Marty."

Carey was inducted into the "Hall of Great Western Performers" at the National Cowboy & Heritage Museum in 2003.
