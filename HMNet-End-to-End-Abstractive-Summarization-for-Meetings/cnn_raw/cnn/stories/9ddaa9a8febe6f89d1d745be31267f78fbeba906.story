(CNN) -- Just a few weeks after the Los Angeles Unified School District approved thousands of pink slips for employees, incoming superintendent John Deasy has requested a pay cut.

The superintendent position pays an annual salary of $330,000.

But Deasy, who is currently serving as deputy superintendent, sent a letter to the district requesting he keep his current salary of $275,000, according to A.J Duffy, president of the teachers union.

Duffy said the request comes as the district is dealing with budget shortfalls and after it approved layoffs for more than 5,000 teachers, and health and human services personnel.

The teachers union is praising Deasy's decision.

"Bravo John, you did the right thing," Duffy said.

Deasy was appointed superintendent in January and will begin his new job on April 15.
