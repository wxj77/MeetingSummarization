(CNN) -- Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, the two surviving members of the Beatles, will get back together to play the star-studded "The Night That Changed America: A Grammys Salute to The Beatles," Starr said Monday.

"To celebrate the 50 years since we landed in New York in February (1964), they're putting on a big show on Monday and we'll be doing it there," he told "Access Hollywood" on Monday at a David Lynch Foundation event.

Starr was being honored by the Lynch Foundation with its Lifetime of Peace and Love Award.

The Recording Academy, which oversees the Grammy Awards, had already said that McCartney and Starr would both be performing at the Grammys Sunday night -- though the question of whether they'll be performing together is still unconfirmed.

The two will be given a Lifetime Achievement Award at Sunday's show.

The "Grammys Salute" is being taped the next day, January 27, and will air on CBS on Sunday, February 9 -- the 50th anniversary of the Beatles' debut appearance on "The Ed Sullivan Show." The Sullivan performance was the first time most Americans had seen the band perform after their first Capitol Records single, "I Want to Hold Your Hand," hit No. 1.

Among the other artists performing at the "Grammys Salute" are Alicia Keys, John Legend, Keith Urban and a reuniting Eurythmics.

If McCartney and Starr do perform together, it will be the first time the two have played together since a 2010 concert to celebrate Starr's 70th birthday in July 2010. Prior to that, the pair played together at a 2009 event for the David Lynch Foundation.

The Beatles' other members, John Lennon and George Harrison, died in 1980 and 2001, respectively.
