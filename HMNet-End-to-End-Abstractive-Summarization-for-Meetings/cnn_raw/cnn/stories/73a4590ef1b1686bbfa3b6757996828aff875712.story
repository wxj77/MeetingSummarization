(CNN) -- Country music star Wynonna Judd's new husband suffered "serious but non-life threatening injuries" in a motorcycle crash in South Dakota Saturday, a statement from her publicist said Sunday.

The accident happened as Judd, 48, and Michael Scott "Cactus" Moser "went for a ride together on separate bikes before her scheduled concert in Deadwood, South Dakota," according to the statement.

"Moser collided with an oncoming vehicle and was transported to a local hospital," the statement said. "He is being treated for serious but non-life threatening injuries. Wynonna was not involved in the accident."

Judd has postponed next week's concerts in Canada to stay by the side of her husband, who is also her drummer.

"The outpouring of prayer and support from friends, family and fans has been a blessing to both Cactus and I," Judd said. "Cactus is a champion. I love him deeply and I will not leave his side."

The couple married on her Tennessee farm on June 10.
