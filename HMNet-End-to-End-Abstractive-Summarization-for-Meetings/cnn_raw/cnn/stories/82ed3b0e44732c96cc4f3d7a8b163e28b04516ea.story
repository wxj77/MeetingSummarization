(CNN) -- "Fifty Shades of Grey" fans are hot -- and not for the reason you might think.

No sooner were the stars of the forthcoming film adaptation of the wildly successful erotic novel announced than the Internet roared its disapproval. No, no, no some fans cried to the casting of Charlie Hunnam and Dakota Johnson as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele respectively.

The front-runners for the gig appear to be "White Collar" star Matt Bomer and Alexis Bledel, who is best known from the hit TV show "Gilmore Girls." There is even a Change.org petition demanding that the roles be recast and given to that pair.

Wow.

As we learned with the drama that became "Batfleck" (yes, that's henceforth the term for the madness that went down when it was announced that Ben Affleck would be playing Batman) people take very seriously these casting decisions -- especially when it's a pair of characters they have been fantasizing about.

Therefore it seems like just about everyone has "Fifty Shades" opinion. And Twitter lit up with them, from the serious to the semi-joshing.
