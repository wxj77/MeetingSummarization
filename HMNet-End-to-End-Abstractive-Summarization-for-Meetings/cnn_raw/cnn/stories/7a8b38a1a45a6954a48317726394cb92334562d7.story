(CNN) -- A black-and-white photo of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith's daughter and an older actor has sparked controversy, but Pinkett Smith says the critics have it wrong.

In a picture that's been widely circulated online, Pinkett Smith's 13-year-old daughter Willow is seen lying on a bed fully dressed with 20-year-old "Hannah Montana" star Moises Arias, who is shirtless. Some observers have been disturbed by the photograph, believing the situation depicted was too intimate for a young teen.

According to TMZ, Arias initially posted the photo to Instagram but has since removed it, although it's still on his website.

Smith's mom, Jada Pinkett Smith, has said she doesn't see anything wrong with the photograph. In fact, she said Wednesday, anyone who does should question their interpretation.

"Here's the deal," she told TMZ photographers. "There was nothing sexual about that picture or that situation.

"You guys are projecting your trash onto it, and you're acting like covert pedophiles," she said. "That's not cool."
