(CNN) -- The fatal bombing of the Boston Marathon is not the first time a sporting event has been targeted. Gunmen, suicide bombers and kidnappers have attacked athletes and venues across the world - from Munich, to Angola, Pakistan and the United States. They have been separatists, militants and activists.

Here are some of the attacks:

September 1972: Palestinians going by the name of "Black September" kill two Israeli athletes and take nine hostage at the 1972 Munich Olympics, demanding that Israel release 200 political prisoners. All the Israeli hostages are later killed. A German police officer and five of the kidnappers also die.

July 1996: An 18kg (40 pound) pipe bomb explodes during a nighttime music concert at the Centennial Olympic Park, killing one person and injuring more than 100 others. In 2005, Eric Robert Rudolph admits responsibility for the attack. He says he wanted to shame the U.S. for its legalization of abortion but had planned to knock out Atlanta's power grid not to harm innocent civilians.

May 2002: Seventeen people are injured when a car bomb is detonated near the Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid hours before a Champions League semifinal between Real Madrid and Barcelona FC.

2006: Fifteen members of Iraq's Olympic taekwondo team are kidnapped for ransom while driving to Jordan in May. A year later, 13 of their bodies are found.

In July, gunmen snatched more than 20 Iraqi sports officials -- including the head of Iraq's Olympic Committee from an Iraq National Olympic Committee meeting in Baghdad. It remains unclear what happened to the officials. Read more: Rogge asks for release of hostages
