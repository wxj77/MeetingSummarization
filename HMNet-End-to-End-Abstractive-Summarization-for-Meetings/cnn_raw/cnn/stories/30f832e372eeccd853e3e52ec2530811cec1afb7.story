(EW.com) -- Sony Pictures has started development on the fourth movie in the "Men in Black" franchise, EW has confirmed. The Wrap first reported the news.

The 'Men in Black 3' ending makes no sense, no sense at all

Oren Uziel, who is writing the upcoming "Mortal Kombat" movie, has scored the screenwriting gig for "MIB 4." He is also writing Sony's sequel to "21 Jump Street," last year's hit comedy starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill.

That sequel will open on June 6, 2014. No release date has been set for "MIB 4."

Why Will Smith turned down 'Django'

"Men in Black 3" was a box office success last summer, earning the franchise's highest worldwide gross. The time-traveling threequel brought back franchise stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, and also starred Josh Brolin as an uncanny younger version of Jones' Agent K.
