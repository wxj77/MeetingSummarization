(CNN) -- US Airways announced a $5 baggage fee increase Wednesday.

A US Airways passenger's first checked bag will cost $20 if prepaid online.

The fee for a passenger's first checked bag will rise from $15 to $20 if the fees are prepaid online. Online payment for a second checked bag will jump from $25 to $30.

An additional $5 fee will be added for bags checked at the airport, bringing the fee for the first bag to $25 and the second to $35.

The airline also will implement a $50 fee for the second checked bag on international flights -- $55 if paid at the airport. The first checked bag will continue to be free of charge.

The changes will be applied to tickets purchased on Wednesday or later for travel on or after October 7.

Also on Wednesday, Continental Airlines implemented a second checked bag fee of $50 for transatlantic flights. Travelers who pay in advance will be charged $45.
