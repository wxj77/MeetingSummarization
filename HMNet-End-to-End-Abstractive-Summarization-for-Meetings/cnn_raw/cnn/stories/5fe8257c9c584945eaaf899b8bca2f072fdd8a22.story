(EW.com) -- TNT has offed "Mob City."

Based on the book by John Buntin, the limited series from "The Walking Dead" creator Frank Darabont ran for three weeks on the cable net to disappointing results. (The premiere only notched 2.3 million viewers and went down from there.)

TNT said in a statement Monday it had decided not to order any more episodes, but that it remained "proud" of the series.

"'Mob City' was created as a three-week television event and we are incredibly proud of the six hours we presented of this remarkable drama," a TNT spokesperson said.

"Although the ratings of the limited series haven't warranted more hours we are eager to work with Frank Darabont again and were delighted to bring the vibrant world of 'Mob City' to life."

"Mob City" starred "Walking Dead" alum Jon Bernthal, Ed Burns, and Neal McDonough.
