Cairo (CNN) -- Voting in Egypt's first elections since the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak will begin in late November, a week later than previously announced, the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said Tuesday.

Egypt's military rulers said the first phase of parliamentary elections will begin November 28.

The elections will take place in three stages across different districts, the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said.

"The results will be announced on January 10. Then the writing of the constitution will begin immediately, " said Major Alaa Al Iraqi, a spokesman for the Council. "Parliament's first session should be in March. Then the presidential elections will come next."

The January 25 revolution -- a movement of several political groups, named after the revolution that ousted Mubarak -- had warned that if the Council did not announce a specific date and mechanism for the elections, it would stage an open-ended sit-in on September 30.

The group also stressed that the military must secure the polls to avoid violence and allow a mechanism for Egyptian living abroad to participate.

The Supreme Council has announced that " international agencies and NGOs are welcome to observe the elections."

Since an 18-day popular uprising forced Mubarak from power in February, demonstrators have criticized the country's interim military rulers and called for elections.

Mubarak faces charges of corruption and ordering the killing of anti-government protesters. He has denied the charges.
