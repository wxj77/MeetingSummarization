(CNN) -- Police in Ohio say a father cut his family off from the outside world, sexually abused at least one of his daughters and locked one child in a closet-sized room for a year.

A grand jury has indicted Jeffrey York, 47, on charges that include rape and child endangerment, CNN affiliate WJW reported. Police in Madison Township, Ohio, revealed new details about the investigation to reporters Saturday.

Authorities began investigating in December, when York's wife called 911 to report a sexual offense, Detective Dan Boerner said. When detectives arrived, she told them she and her seven children wanted to leave the home.

Family members accused York of abusing them mentally and physically for more than a decade, Boerner said.

"The children who were of age for education were home-schooled for the most part, had no friends to speak of and no real outlets or resources to go to," he said.

York locked one child in a tiny room for a year, Boerner said, letting the child out periodically to go to the restroom.

"In general, meals were brought to this child. Access to clothing, the restroom and everything was restricted by Mr. York," Boerner said.

A grand jury has indicted York on charges that include two counts of rape involving a female under the age of 13, five instances of gross sexual imposition and six counts of child endangering, WJW reported. York has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

The public defender representing York declined to comment when reached by CNN affiliate WEWS.

Detectives who have worked on the case for months said the investigation is difficult to handle.

"There are just so many directions to go," Boerner said. "It's not just one allegation involving one victim. It's multiple allegations involving multiple victims, so it makes it a little more difficult."
