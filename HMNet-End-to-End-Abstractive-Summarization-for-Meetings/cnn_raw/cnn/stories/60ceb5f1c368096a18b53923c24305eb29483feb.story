(CNN) -- Country singer Billy Currington is a wanted man, indicted on charges of making terroristic threats and the abuse of an elderly person by a Georgia grand jury.

The indictment accused Currington, 39, of threatening bodily harm against Charles Harvey Ferrelle in Tybee Island, Georgia, on April 15.

The elder abuse charge was included because Farrell is older than 65, the indictment said.

A Savannah judge issued a bench warrant for Currington's arrest after the indictment was handed up by a Chatham County grand jury that "found sufficient evidence" against him, District Attorney Meg Heap said Wednesday.

The prosecutor did not give any other details about the allegations.

Currington and his representatives did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment, although the singer did post a message to fans through his Twitter account: "hey guys, I wanted to thank everyone for the huge amount of support that I have received already. Unfortunately, I can't comment on this situation as this is an ongoing legal matter. It means a lot to me to have your support during this time."

While it is unclear if there is a connection, Currington tweeted this two days after the alleged incident: "harrassing artists often at their home by boat should be illegal. thas all i know."

Although Currington mostly lives in Nashville, he is a native of Rincon, Georgia, which is about 35 miles inland from Tybee Island.

Currington's hit country songs include "Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right," "Good Directions," "People Are Crazy," "That's How Country Boys Roll," "Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer," and "Let Me Down Easy."
