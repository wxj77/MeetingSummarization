WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets -- flying off the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman -- crashed Monday night in the Persian Gulf, U.S. Navy officials said.

The aircrafts' three aviators were recovered safely after they ejected from the jets -- a single-seat F/A-18E and two-seat F/A-18F.

The U.S. Navy did not immediately know the cause of the F/A-18 crash.

There is no indication of hostile fire action, the officials said.

The incident is not related to Sunday's confrontation between three U.S. Navy warships and five Iranian boats, Navy officials said. E-mail to a friend
