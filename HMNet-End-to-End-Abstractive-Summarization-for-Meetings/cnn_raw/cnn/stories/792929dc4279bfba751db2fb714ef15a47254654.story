(CNN) -- Flooding has claimed 102 lives in southwestern Nigeria, where a dam burst and a river overflowed near the city of Ibadan, officials said Wednesday.

A rain deluge from Friday night to early Saturday caused the Odo Ona River to overflow and the Eleyele dam to collapse, said Yushau Shuaib of the government's National Emergency Management Agency.

Several homes were swept away and temporary camps were set up, Shuaib said.

The Nigerian Red Cross, which is helping in the crisis, said earlier this week that more victims could still be found in remote areas that rescue teams have not reached.

The government is delivering aid to people displaced by the flooding in Ibadan and surrounding areas in Oyo state, the National Emergency Management Agency said.

Thousands of people have been displaced, and about 1,500 of them are being looked after in centers run by government officials and the Red Cross in the Ibadan area, Red Cross spokesman Umar Mairiga told CNN on Tuesday.

They are being given emergency food rations, as well as mattresses, blankets and rubber mats, Mairiga said.

The deputy governor of Oyo state, Chief Moses Adeyemo, called for more federal government help to resettle those displaced and to rebuild bridges and water channels destroyed by the flooding, the statement said.

NEMA warned that there could be more flooding in urban areas during the rainy season if drains were inadequate or blocked by uncleared waste.

Journalist  Alkasim Abdulkadir and CNN's Christian Purefoy and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.
