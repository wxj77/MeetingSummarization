(CNN) -- The New York Yankees made Major League Baseball (MLB) history on Thursday when they became the first team to hit three grand slams in a single game.

The match at the Yankee Stadium saw the home team run out 22-9 winners against the Oakland Athletics, with the Yankees hitting home runs with the bases loaded on three occasions.

A grand slam is when a team's batter hits a home run with three of his teammates already stood on the bases, resulting in four runs being scored.

Robinson Cano, Curtis Granderson and Russell Martin were the three men on the plate to hit the grand slams for the Yankees -- who sit second in the Eastern Conference behind the Boston Red Sox.

"It's pretty amazing," Martin, 28, told the MLB's official web site. "This game has been played for a long time. Pretty much everything has already happened.

"I'm waiting to see who's going to hit four -- I don't know if it's ever going to happen, but we'll see. Three is pretty cool."

Center-fielder Granderson connected with the hit which sealed the historic achievement, and the 30-year-old had to look at the stadium's scoreboard to be sure of what the Yankees had accomplished.

"When I saw it, I was like, 'Oh, wow,'" Granderson said. "I'm surprised it hasn't been done before, just with all the great teams and great individual hitters that have come throughout the course of the game."

In the 108-year history of the New York Yankees, the team have only ever hit two grand slams in a match on three occasions -- and never at their own ballpark.

Paul O'Neill and Bernie Williams were the last two players to record grand slams in the same game, during a trip to the Toronto Blue Jays on September 14 1999.
