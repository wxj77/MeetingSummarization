(CNN) -- Margot Fonteyn, one of only two British dancers appointed Prima Ballerina Assoluta, is your most iconic dancer of the 20th century.

Last month, CNN's arts and culture program, icon, asked you to vote for your top five iconic dancers of the last century.

Partnered, at 42, with the considerably younger Rudolf Nureyev, the duo was catapulted to star status and Fonteyn's dancing career spanned two more decades.

Breakdancing pioneer Ken Swift came in second place. Swift is credited with establishing hip hop as a legitimate dance movement and creating many of its classic moves.

One of The New York City Ballet's greatest stars, Suzanne Farrell, took third place, while modern dancer Judith Jamison and ballet's Mikhail Baryshnikov rounded out the top five.

In February, we want to know who you think is the greatest classical composer of all time.

We'll name your top five on when the show airs on February 24.
