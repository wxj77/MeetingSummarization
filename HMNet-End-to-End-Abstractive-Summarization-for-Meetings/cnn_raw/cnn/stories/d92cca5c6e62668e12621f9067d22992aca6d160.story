(CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan is scheduled to start her 90-day jail sentence Tuesday, but the star's last moments of freedom may not be captured by cameras.

The troubled movie star is scheduled to be in a Los Angeles courtroom Tuesday morning where she will be taken into custody.

Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel has placed tight restrictions on what the public will be able to see at the court hearing.

While the world watched as Lohan broke down in tears at her sentencing on July 6, the public won't be able to see the actress handcuffed and taken into custody on Tuesday, the judge ruled.

Cameras also must stop rolling when the judge announces that Lohan is remanded and the bailiff is instructed to take her into custody. The judge also ordered that photos of Lohan must be restricted to when she's at the counsel table.

Lohan was ordered to serve 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation. She was also sentenced to spend 90 days in a drug and alcohol rehab program after her jail term is completed.
