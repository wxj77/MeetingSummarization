(CNN) -- Actor Nicholas Brendon, best known as Xander Harris on the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" TV series, was arrested in Boise, Idaho, showing signs of intoxication, police said.

Brendon was in town for the Tree City Comic Con.

Police were called to a downtown hotel Friday after reports of a disturbance in the lobby, according a news release from the Boise Police Department.

"When officers arrived, they found the suspect who showed signs of intoxication and repeatedly refused officers commands to stay seated while officers tried to speak with witnesses," the release said. "When the suspect continued to try and walk away, officers took him into custody for resisting and obstructing."

The hotel staff said Brendon had broken a decorative dish and they wanted to press charges.

He was booked into the Ada County Jail and bonded out, police said.

Brendon is charged with two misdemeanors -- malicious injury to property and resisting or obstructing officers.

Police say additional charges are possible.

Brendon remained on the schedule to speak at an event Saturday evening.

His Twitter account thanked fans for their "love, support and positive vibes."

On Monday, Brendon took to his Facebook to write, "I can offer an explanation but I make no excuse for my unacceptable behavior."

He said that he had a cyst behind his kneecap, for which he was taking pain medication, which he then mixed with alcohol.

Calling the resulting episode "embarrassing and unacceptable," he said, "I intend to seek appropriate treatment and therapy for my medical ailments as well as my emotional demons."

He closed with, "Again: I apologize. Those two small words don't begin to express my regrets, but they do mark the beginning of my recovery. During this difficult time, I appreciate understanding as I pursue rehabilitation -- and I value support as I earn redemption with my family, friends, and fans."
