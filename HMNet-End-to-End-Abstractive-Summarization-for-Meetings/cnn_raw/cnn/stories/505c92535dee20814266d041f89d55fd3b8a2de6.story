(CNN)French authorities say a woman in the latest video released by French-speaking ISIS fighters may be Hayat Boumeddiene, who is believed to have knowledge about the deadly January 9 attack on a Paris kosher grocery, a source close to the investigation told CNN.

The video, titled "Blow Up France 2," was released Tuesday and shows an ISIS fighter praising previous attackers in France and calling for new attacks.

The video shows a woman standing next to the speaker, wearing camouflage clothing and holding a weapon.

"French authorities are investigating the possibility this woman could be Hayat Boumeddiene," the source said.

Her husband, Amedy Coulibaly, killed four hostages January 9 at a kosher grocery in Paris, authorities said. He was killed by police in a rescue and the remaining hostages fled to safety.

Authorities are searching for Boumeddiene, who is believed to be in Syria. She and Coulibaly were married in a religious ceremony, but the marriage was not officially recognized under French law.

The grocery store attack followed the January 8 attack by Islamic gunmen on Charlie Hebdo, a satire magazine. The next day, a French police officer was killed. Seventeen people were killed over those three days.

The latest ISIS video calls for more attacks on soldiers and police officers in France.

"If you fight for democracy, we will fight for Islam," they say to officials. "You will have to accept that we will react fully to the numerous crimes you committed. You took our rights. Therefore you can't expect to be in peace."
