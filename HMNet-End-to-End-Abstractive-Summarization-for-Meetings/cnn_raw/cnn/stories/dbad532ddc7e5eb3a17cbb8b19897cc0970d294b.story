(CNN) -- A 34-year-old man is in custody in connection with a fatal subway incident over the weekend in New York City, police said Tuesday.

A man was pushed to his death from the subway platform into the path of the D train on Sunday.

Bronx resident Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, was killed by the incoming subway train, police said.

Kwok's wife was with him and was taken to the hospital for trauma, though she was not physically injured.

Kwok was standing on the platform at the subway station at 167th Street and Grand Concourse when he was apparently pushed. First responders arrived at about 8:45 a.m., and Kwok was pronounced dead at the scene.

The suspect then fled the station. As of late Tuesday, no charges have been filed, according to Lt. John Grimpel.

CNN's David Shortell and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.
