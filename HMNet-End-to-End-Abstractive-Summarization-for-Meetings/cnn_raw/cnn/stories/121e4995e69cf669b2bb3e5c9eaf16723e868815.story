Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A man "holding 2 big knifes" was captured by police after trying to break into Paris Hilton's Los Angeles, California, home Tuesday morning, Hilton said in a Twitter posting.

Police responded to a 911 call that someone was breaking into Hilton's Sherman Oaks home at 6:42 a.m., Los Angeles Police spokesman Gregory Beak said.

Hilton was sleeping early Tuesday when a man with two kitchen knives attempted to enter her home, her publicist said.

"The security cameras and alarm system were alerted and the police immediately came to the house and arrested the intruder who was attempting to break a window when they arrived," Dawn Miller said.

The police spokesman and Hilton's publicist said no one was injured.

"Paris is naturally shaken by the events but is unharmed and well," Miller said. "She is very thankful to her security team and the police for their swift and diligent response."

Hilton alerted fans in a message posted on her Twitter account:

"So Scary, just got woken up to a guy trying to break into my house holding 2 big knifes. Cops are here arresting him."

A man taken into custody near the home was "awaiting charges" Tuesday morning, Baek said.

No one was injured, he said.
