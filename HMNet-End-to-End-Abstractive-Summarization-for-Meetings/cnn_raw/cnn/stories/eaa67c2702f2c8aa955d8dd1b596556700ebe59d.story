(CNN) -- FACETIME: Russian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin

Russian Railways is making major tracks into the Middle East. The state-owned rail operator recently unveiled a number of multi-billon dollar projects across the Middle East, from a light metro line in Kuwait to a high-speed cargo/passenger network in the UAE and a cross-national project in Iran.

MME met up with the Russian Railways president at the Moskovsky train station in St. Petersburg.

IN FOCUS: Russians love UAE

More and more Russians are calling the UAE "home." In fact, it's estimated that some 50,000 live in the Emirates. No surprise then that cultural and business ties between the two countries are increasing all the time.

MME explores this growing community by visiting a Russian restaurant, university and property development -- as well as the UAE's Russian National Day party and a Russian Othodox church -- the only one in the Arab peninsula.
