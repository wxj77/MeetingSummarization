BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A roadside bomb attack on Monday killed two U.S. soldiers in Baghdad, the U.S. military said.

U.S. troops patrol near a checkpoint in Baghdad last week.

Another soldier was wounded in the attack and taken to a combat support hospital, according to military spokesman Lt. David Russell.

The deaths follow an incident Saturday in which a U.S. soldier died and two others were injured when their vehicle rolled over at a forward operating base near Balad, north of Baghdad, Russell said.

July marked the lowest monthly toll of the war, with 11 U.S. troop deaths -- six killed in hostilities and five dying from causes not related to combat, according to a CNN count of figures released by the Pentagon.

With the three deaths in August, 4,130 U.S. military personnel have died since the Iraq war began in 2003.
