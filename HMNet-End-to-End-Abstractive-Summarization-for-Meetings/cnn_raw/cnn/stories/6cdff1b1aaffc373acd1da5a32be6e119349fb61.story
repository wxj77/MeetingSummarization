(CNN) -- UEFA have awarded a 3-0 victory to Italy after their Euro 2012 qualifying match with Serbia was abandoned due to violence.

Serbia have also been ordered to play their next two home qualifying games behind closed doors after their fans disrupted the match between the two countries in Genoa on October 12.

After disturbances before the game, away supporters threw flares on the pitch, lit fireworks and tried to smash a Perspex fence before the referee called the game off after just seven minutes of action.

Serbia had asked for the game to be replayed, but UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body said it had decided to award a 3-0 win to Italy after the abandonment.

A statement on their official website read: "The Football Association of Serbia (FSS) has been ordered to play its next two home matches behind closed doors. From this sanction, a one-match ban is deferred for a probationary period of two years.

"The Control and Disciplinary Body has ordered the FSS to refrain from ordering tickets for Serbian supporters for all the away matches of the Serbian team during the remainder of the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying competition. The association was also fined a total of €120,000 (166,972).

"The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) received a sanction of one match to be played behind closed doors. This sanction is deferred for a probationary period of two years. The association was fined €100,000 ($139,143)."

The victory means Italy go three points clear of Slovenia at the top of Euro 2012 qualifying Group C, while Serbia remain fifth with four points from four games.
