(CNN) -- A Boonton, New Jersey, man's plot to have his wife shot to death included having himself shot as well in an attempt to conceal his involvement, New Jersey prosecutors said Friday.

Kashif Parvaiz was wounded four times, and his wife, Nazish Noorani, was fatally shot about 11 p.m. Tuesday as the couple pushed a stroller carrying their 3-year-old son, Morris County Prosecutor Robert A. Bianchi said at a news conference.

Parvaiz and Antoinette Stephen of Boston, both 26, have been arrested, charged with murder, conspiracy and unlawful possession of a weapon, Bianchi said. Parvaiz also is charged with hindering apprehension and endangering the welfare of a child.

The boy was uninjured, Bianchi said.

The fact that Noorani, a Muslim, was killed during the holy month of Ramadan "made this case especially compelling to us," he said.

According to an affidavit on file with the court, Parvaiz has told police he arranged for Stephen to kill his wife and wound him while the couple was out for a walk.

While being treated for his wounds, which were not life-threatening, Parvaiz described the shooters as three men who shouted "slurs about terrorists" at the couple before fleeing on foot, according to a release from Morris County prosecutors.

But within hours of the crime, investigators believed "it was obvious" the victim's husband was behind the attack, Bianchi said.

Noorani, 27, had sent text messages to her brother describing escalating hostility and abuse in her marriage, the affidavit says, warning that "someday u will find me dead but its cuz of kashi ... He wants to kill me."

Bianchi said Stephen was arrested in Boston on Thursday night. On Friday, prosecutors would not characterize the relationship of Parvaiz and Stephen.

Bail for Parvaiz is set at $1 million while Stephens, awaiting extradition, is being held in lieu of $5 million.

Attempts to locate an attorney who could speak on behalf of Parvaiz or Stephen were not immediately successful Friday afternoon.
