(CNN) -- Richard Elman is the Founder and Chief Executive of the global supply chain manager Noble Group. He is responsible for overseeing the management team and formulation of its overall strategic planning.

He first arrived in Asia in the mid-1960s, from England, and has more than 40 years of experience as a physical commodity trader and supply chain architect. He was the first person to sell Daqing crude oil from China to the U.S., and the first to dock a foreign commercial vessel in Vladivostok, Russia.

Prior to founding Noble Group in 1987, he spent ten years with Philipp Brothers as Regional Director of its Asia operations, including two years as a Board Director in New York.

Mr Elman has today built Noble Group into a leading force in supply chain management from its headquarters in Hong Kong, and his reputation for leadership is complemented by numerous industry awards and accolades.

Under his leadership of two decades, Noble Group's revenues have grown consistently to reach $13.7 billion in 2006, representing a 20-fold increase from $677.5 million in 1996.

In 2004, he guided Noble's Board of Directors to claim the Listed Companies (Main Board) Boards Award from The Hong Kong Institute of Directors and oversaw the top ranking on the Billion-dollar club of the Singapore Stock Exchange for Total Shareholder Returns over a three and five year period.

Noble also landed on top of the Forbes Global 2000 as the world's best performing stock from 2001 - 2005 (2,302%). E-mail to a friend
