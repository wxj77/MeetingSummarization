Atlanta (CNN) -- Natina Reed, one-third of the early 2000s R&B trio Blaque, was struck by a vehicle and killed Friday night in Georgia, Gwinnett County police said Saturday.

Reed, 32, was walking in traffic on a major roadway just north of the metro Atlanta city of Lilburn "for some unknown reason" when she was struck around 10:30 p.m., according to Gwinnett police spokesman Sgt. Rich Long.

The driver of the vehicle, who was not charged in the incident, called 911 while the passenger administered CPR. Reed was pronounced dead at Gwinnett Medical Center.

Blaque, best known for the 2000 hit "Bring it All to Me," was discovered by TLC's Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes. The group's self-titled album debuted in 1999. Lopes herself died in a 2002 car accident in Honduras.

Fellow Blaque members Shamari Devoe and Brandi Williams took to Twitter on Saturday to remember Reed.

"My world as I know it has forever changed. Until we meet again, may you find comfort in the arms of an angel. I love you Natina," Devoe tweeted.

Reed also appeared in the 2000 movie "Bring it On" as Jenelope, a feisty cheerleader from East Compton. Her co-star, Gabrielle Union, also tweeted about her death Saturday, posting "#RIP #Sad #BringItOn."

Reed is survived by her 10-year-old son, Tren.
