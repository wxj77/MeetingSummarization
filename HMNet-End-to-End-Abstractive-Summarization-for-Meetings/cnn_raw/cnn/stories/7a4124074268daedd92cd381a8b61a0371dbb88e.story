(CNN)Authorities in Palm Desert, California, are looking for missing AIG insurance company executive Omar Meza.

The 33-year-old was last seen at the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort & Spa on Thursday night after a company dinner. Meza was reported missing after he failed to show up for various meetings the following day.

"I spoke to him ... I was the last conversation per his telephone records ... on Thursday night around 11:20 p.m.," said his wife Diane.

"It was late on a work night. I told him, 'head to your hotel and call me when you get there.' I never got that call," she said. "I tried calling him but he didn't answer. I just went to bed. Didn't think too much of it."

She said her husband suffered short-term memory loss from a traffic accident last year. It's uncertain whether that had any impact on his disappearance.

Meza's jacket and wallet were found on the resort's golf course, CNN affilaites KESQ and KMIR reported.

The Palm Desert Sheriff's Station says it's using all available resources in the search for Meza, including bloodhounds and Desert Search and Rescue.

Authorities call it an active and ongoing investigation.

Palm Desert is located about 120 miles east of Los Angeles in Riverside County.

CNN's Travis Sattiewhite, Teri Genova and Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.
