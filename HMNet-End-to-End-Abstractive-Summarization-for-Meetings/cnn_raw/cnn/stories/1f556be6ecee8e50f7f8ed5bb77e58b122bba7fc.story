The rapid sweep of Islamic militants from Syria into northern Iraq has sent the Middle East into crisis, caused alarm in capitals from Tehran to Washington and forced about half a million people to flee their homes.

The flood of Iraqis trying to escape ISIS fighters doubled the country's displaced population almost overnight. More than 1.1 million people -- nearly one out of 30 -- in Iraq are now displaced.

Ahead of World Refugee Day on Friday, CNN looks at where they came from and where they've gone.

From:

Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, in the past few weeks: 500,000

Tal Afar, a smaller city north of Mosul: 84,000

Tikrit and Samarra, cities on the road from Mosul to Baghdad: about 40,000

Diyala province, between Baghdad and the Iranian border: 6,000

Anbar province, west of Baghdad: 480,000

To:

Duhuk, a city in the north: 230,000 from Mosul and Tal Afar

Irbil, a city southeast of Mosul: 100,000 from Mosul

Displaced within the city of Mosul itself: 25,000

Sinjar and surroundings in the north: 54,000 from Tall Afar

Kirkuk: about 23,000 from Mosul and Anbar province

Sulaimaniya: More than 26,000 from Anbar and Diyala provinces

Tikrit: 83,500 from Anbar province

Displaced within Anbar province: 286,000

Baghdad: 46,800 from Anbar province
