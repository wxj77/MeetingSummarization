(CNN) -- In the world of diving, this is as good as it gets.

Standing on a platform some 27 meters high with Bilbao's Nervion River flowing underneath, the view from La Salve Bridge is something to behold.

The spectacular Guggenheim Museum provides a breathtaking backdrop for those brave enough to leap into the water from a platform three times higher than those used at the Olympic Games.

The Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series brings together some of the best in the business and the 52,000 which flocked to see the likes of Russia's Artem Silchenko and overall champion, Gary Hunt, were not to be disappointed.

The 14 men from across the world produced a number of breathtaking dives, hitting the water at 85 kilometers an hour during the event which has been held every year since 2009.

While Silchenko won the Bilbao event, Hunt finished second as the Briton secured his fourth world title in five years.
