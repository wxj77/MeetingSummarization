(CNN) -- Authorities say they have made an arrest in the case of a Georgia college student missing since last month.

Police at Middle Georgia State College arrested and charged Robert Kane Rolison, 17, with one count of murder in the disappearance and death of Jmaal Malik Keyes, who was last seen on April 25 and reported missing on April 29. Rolison was arrested at his home Thursday night.

Both were students at the school in Cochran, Georgia. Campus Police Chief Shawn Douglas said Friday that authorities were searching for the body of Keyes, a 19-year-old freshman from Atlanta.

Rolison is from Hawkinsville, Georgia, and police describe him as a dual-enrolled high school/Middle Georgia State student.

The suspect is now in custody at a Bleckley County, Georgia, facility.

Rolison and Keyes knew each other, and Rolison gave Keyes a ride to a convenience store the day Keyes went missing, Douglas said. The chief is not commenting on a motive and said he doesn't know of any prior conflict between Rolison and Keyes.

"We are absolutely devastated by this news," said John Black, the college's interim president.

"There just are no words to describe how deeply hurt we are and how terrible we feel for Jmaal's family. I wish to convey my heartfelt condolences to everyone in his family, and everyone who knew Jmaal."
