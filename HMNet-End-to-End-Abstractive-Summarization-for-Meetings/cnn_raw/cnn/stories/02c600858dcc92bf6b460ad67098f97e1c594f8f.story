(CNN) -- Teenage golf sensation Noh Seung-Yul has entered the sport's record books as the youngest player to top the Asian Tour's money list.

The 19-year-old, who won $822,361 on his way to becoming the Asian Tour's No. 1, was honored for his achievements at an award ceremony in Thailand following the conclusion of the 2010 season.

As well as claiming the Order of Merit trophy, the South Korean was also named the Players' Player of the Year, but was unable to accept the accolades in person after having recently undergone corrective eye surgery.

"I am honored becoming the youngest-ever Asian Tour champion in history," the world No. 66 said in a video message played at the event.

"It is also special for me to win the Players' Player of the Year Award as this is nominated by my fellow professionals."

Noh's season highlights include victory at the Malaysian Open in March and four other top-10 finishes on the Asian Tour, and he did not miss a halfway cut in all of its events that he played.

He also made the weekend rounds in two of the three major tournaments in which he gained entry, finishing tied for 40th place at the U.S. Open and equal 28th at the PGA Championship.

"The Asian Tour has done so much in my career and I am thankful for the opportunities that I have enjoyed since coming through from qualifying school in 2008," he said.

"My game has become better over the years through the high level of competition and I will continue to represent the tour proudly."

Another qualifying school graduate, Rikard Karlberg of Sweden, was named Rookie of the Year after finishing third in the Order of Merit in his debut season.

Japan's Tetsuji Hiratsuka finished fifth overall on $333,000 after winning Sunday's closing tournament, the Black Mountain Masters in Thailand.

The 39-year-old claimed his third title this season as he beat young home hope Namchoak Tantipokakul in the first hole of a playoff in Hua Hin.
