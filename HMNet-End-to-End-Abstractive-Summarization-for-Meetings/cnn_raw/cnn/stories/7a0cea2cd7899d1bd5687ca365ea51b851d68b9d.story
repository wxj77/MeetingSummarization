(CNN) -- A day marred by violence in Indianapolis ended with a police officer killed and seven people shot in a popular entertainment district.

Officer Perry Renn was responding to a call of shots fired Saturday night when he and another officer approached a group of people in an alley, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said.

As police got closer, a gunman shot at the officers, IMPD said. Police returned fire, but Renn was fatally struck in the shootout.

The suspected gunman, 25-year-old Major Davis Jr., was also struck but survived. Authorities expect Davis to be charged with murder.

Renn was a 21-year veteran of the police department.

"This is a sad day for the IMPD family and the community as a whole," Police Chief Rick Hite said.

Earlier Saturday, six men and one woman were shot in a popular bar district, Indianapolis police Lt. Chris Bailey said.

The seven were shot on the street, Bailey said. One man was in critical condition, and the others suffered nonlife-threatening injuries.

Police have not identified a suspect in that shooting, and the motive remains unclear.
