(CNN) -- Could there be an American team in Formula One for the first time in more than 25 years?

NASCAR team co-owner Gene Haas has thrown his hat into the ring to enter a new team into the F1 world championship.

Last month the sport's governing body, the FIA, asked prospective entrants to make "an expression of interest" to join the grid as a 12th team for the start of the 2015 or 2016 season.

Haas, who co-owns Stewart-Haas Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, said Friday that he has answered the call.

"We have responded to the FIA's 'call for expression of interest' regarding a Formula One entry on behalf of Haas Racing Development," the American businessman said in a statement.

"We respect the FIA's evaluation process and will share more details in the coming weeks."

Haas has already tasted success in the premier U.S. racing series when the Stewart-Haas Team, which he founded with three-time Sprint Cup champion driver Tony Stewart, won the 2011 Sprint Cup Series championship.

F1 last expanded the grid in 2010 when three new teams joined. Of the trio, two are still racing in their current guises -- Caterham and Marussia.

The Spanish Hispania (HRT) team withdrew from the sport at the end of 2012 because of financial difficulties.

The last U.S. backed team ran a limited number of races during the 1985 and 1986 seasons under the Lola-Hart moniker.

Other American teams to enter the sport include Eagle, which debuted in 1966, Shadow and Penkse, both of which raced in the 1970s.

The USF1 team launched an unsuccessful bid to join F1 for the 2010 season after difficulties securing financial backing.

The FIA had given parties interesting in joining F1 until January 3 2014 to register their interest but it is not yet known whether there are any other prospective entries.
