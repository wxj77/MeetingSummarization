(CNN) -- It was a meeting apparently straight off the TV screen: Bart Simpson called before Mr. Burns after allegedly causing trouble.

But the encounter did not play out in cartoon form, but rather at Warwick Crown Court in the English Midlands.

Barton Simpson, known as Bart, appeared Monday before the judge, Mr. Recorder Burns, to face charges of possession of a firearm and possession of a dangerous article on board an aircraft.

He pleaded guilty to the latter charge and was ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work in the community and to pay a fine of 800 pounds ($1,200) to the court. He had previously denied possession of a firearm.

The gun was seized and destroyed.

Simpson's cartoon namesake is the star of the long-running U.S. TV series "The Simpsons," which also features a Mr. Burns -- who runs the local nuclear power plant and is Bart's father's boss -- as a nemesis.
