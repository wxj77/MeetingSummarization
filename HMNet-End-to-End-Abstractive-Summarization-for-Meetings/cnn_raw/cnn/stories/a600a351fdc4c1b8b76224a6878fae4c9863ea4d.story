Beijing (CNN) -- A train collision in a tunnel in Shanghai's subway Line 10 last month was caused by human error, said state media, with 12 people disciplined over the incident.

Xinhua News Agency, quoting a report released by the investigation team, reported that Tang Zhihua, chief dispatcher of the Line 10 operation control center, was removed from his post. Eleven other managers and workers of the operation control and power supply sections also received penalties, including job reassignment and demotions.

The two subway trains collided on September 27 in downtown Shanghai, injuring 295 passengers, 70 of whom are still receiving treatment in hospital, according to the report.

"The signal system failed to operate because of power failure. The dispatchers issued a number of erroneous orders which finally led to the crash," Xinhua added.

The accident happened as concerns and criticism mount over China's railway safety and its fast development of rail systems.

On July 23, two high-speed trains crashed in China's coastal Zhejiang province, leaving 39 dead and 192 injured, making it one of China's deadliest rail accidents in recent years.
