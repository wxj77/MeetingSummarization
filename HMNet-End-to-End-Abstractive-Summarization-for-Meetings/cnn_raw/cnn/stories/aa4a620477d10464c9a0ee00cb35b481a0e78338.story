Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's former crown prince was arrested Tuesday on charges of firing a pistol in a public place and threatening others, authorities said.

Paras Shah allegedly fired several rounds at Rubel Chaudhary, a Bangladeshi national and the son-in-law of Nepal's deputy prime minister Sujata Koirala, after an argument Saturday in a wildlife resort in Chitwan, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Kathmandu, according to reports. No one was injured.

"The ex-prince took out a pistol and started to open fire, accusing the Koirala family of conspiring to abolish the monarchy in this country," Chaudhary said Monday, according to media reports.

Police spokesman Bigyan Raj Sharma told CNN the investigation is ongoing.

Koirala's Nepali Congress party, the nation's second-biggest political party, demanded Shah's arrest on Monday. He was arrested in the tourist resort of Pokhara, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) west of Kathmandu, and police were questioning him, according to Ramesh Kharel, superintendent of police.

Shah, 39, traveled to Pokhara from Chitwan on Sunday following the incident.

Nepal abolished the monarchy in 2008, and members of the royal family became commoners. At the time, Koirala's father, Girija Prasad Koirala, was the prime minister.

The hard-partying Shah reportedly has a history of reckless behavior. There have been previous reports of his using firearms in public places in the past. He was also believed to have killed a popular singer, striking him with his car, about a decade ago, when Nepal's monarchy was in place.

However, Tuesday was the first time police have arrested Shah, who splits his time between Kathmandu and Singapore.
