(CNN)  -- World number two Roger Federer stepped up his preparations for the Australian Open with an easy win over Spaniard Carlos Moya in the Kooyong Classic in Melbourne on Wednesday.

Federer plays a backhand during his straight sets win over Moya in Melbourne.

Federer, who will be looking to tie Pete Sampras with his 14th grand slam, opened with a 6-2 6-3 win in the eight-man invitational tournament.

The Swiss has begun the year with successive defeats to world number four Andy Murray in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, but made no mistake against former French Open champion Moya.

He needed just 57 minutes to progress at the former home of the Australian Open.

"I was a little rusty in the beginning, missed quite a few forehands, but I thought it was a good match overall," he told the Press Association. "There were a few gusts of wind, which makes it not easy to play, but I felt like I was playing OK."

Earlier, Federer's compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka also had an easy win over Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis 6-2 6-2. Federer's next opponent will be Spanish Davis Cup hero Fernando Verdasco, who swept past young Croatian star Marin Cilic 6-2 7-5.

Second seed Fernando Gonzalez of Chile also went through as he beat Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia 6-4 6-3.
