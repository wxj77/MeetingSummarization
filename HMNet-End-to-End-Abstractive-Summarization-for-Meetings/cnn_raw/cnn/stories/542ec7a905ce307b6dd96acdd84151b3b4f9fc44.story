(CNN) -- At last the mystery has been solved.

Since a fan tweeted a picture of Jerry Seinfeld and Jason Alexander outside Tom's Restaurant, which served as a stand-in Monk's on the hit NBC show "Seinfeld," there has been buzz about what it could mean. Was it a Super Bowl commercial? Something having to do with Seinfeld's Web series "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee"? Or was it perhaps, like the sitcom, a whole bunch of nothing?

The answer is yes.

In addition to the comic, the mini-"Seinfeld" reunion included Alexander, who played George Costanza on the show, and Wayne Knight, who played Newman the postal carrier. It turned out to be a bit of a commercial for Seinfeld's "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee." On that show, Seinfeld often sits down for a chat with fellow comedians and celebs.

In this case, Seinfeld was in character as Seinfeld hanging out with his old buddy Costanza in search of some grub during the Super Bowl. The pair bantered about a friend's Super Bowl party and a discussion ensued about "over cheering" football games.

Then Jerry's nemesis, Newman, showed up.

In all, it really was straightforward. Though keep in mind "Seinfeld" celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, so perhaps there is something more to the mystery after all.
