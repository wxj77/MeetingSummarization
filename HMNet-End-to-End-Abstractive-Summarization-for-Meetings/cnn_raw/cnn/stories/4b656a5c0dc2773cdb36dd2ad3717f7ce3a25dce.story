(CNN) -- Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund recorded thumping wins in the Bundesliga on Saturday as both teams returned to domestic action following Champions League triumphs in midweek.

Bayern, who wrapped up their 23rd Bundesliga title last weekend, thrashed Nuremburg 4-0 at the Allianz Arena.

Jupp Heynckes rested nine of the team who beat Juventus 2-0 in the Champions League quarterfinal but still cruised to victory.

First-half goals from German defender Jerome Boateng, Mario Gomez and Brazilian Rafinha gave the home side a virtually unassailable lead before Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri grabbed a fourth 11 minutes into the second half.

"The game showed my players have a very professional attitude at this stage of the season," said Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes.

"It's good that I was able to make nine changes, we still have a lot of games ahead of us and I wouldn't have made the changes if I hadn't felt this team would win."

Bayern now have 78 points with five games remaining and seem assured of breaking Borussia Dortmund's league record of 81 points set last year.

After narrowly getting past Malaga in their Champions League quarterfinal on Tuesday, Dortmund made lighter work of Greuther Fuerth on Saturday.

The 6-1 hammering of the Bundesliga's bottom side sees Jurgen Klopp's side consolidate second place in the table.

Elsewhere, relegation-threatened Hoffenheim played out a 2-2 draw with Wolfsburg. Werder Bremen also drew 2-2 with Dusseldorf.

Hamburg move up to eighth in the table after a 2-1 win at Mainz.
