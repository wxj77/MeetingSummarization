(CNN) -- At least seven people were killed and 68 others were wounded after three car bomb explosions Wednesday in Iraq's oil-rich northern city of Kirkuk, said Jamal Taher, police chief.

One of bombings occurred outside a building in central Kirkuk used by Kurdish security forces. Another explosion occurred near an Iraqi federal police patrol in central Kirkiuk. And another car bomb targeted a police patrol in south Kirkuk, Taher said.

These coordinated attacks resembled past attacks by al Qaeda in Iraq, Kirkuk police said

In other attacks, eight civilians were wounded Wednesday morning when two roadside bombs exploded in two Baghdad neighborhoods, police said.

On Tuesday, an Iraqi army officer, Brigadier General Ahsan Ali Mohammed, was killed when a bomb exploded outside his house in western Baghdad's Ghazaliya neighborhood, police said.
