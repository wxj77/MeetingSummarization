Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej approved the prime minister's request to dissolve the lower chamber of that country's Parliament on Monday, setting the stage for new elections, a government spokesman said.

"It is again a new start for people to move Thailand forward and to solve various problems of people and their families efficiently under democratic means," Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said in a national address Monday.

Parliamentary elections will be held July 3, acting government spokesman Panitan Wattanayakorn said.

The prime minister sent a request to King Bhumibol on Friday requesting the move.

Abhisit resisted street demonstrations a year ago demanding that he step down, with clashes between his supporters and those of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra sometimes turning violent.

The prime minister sent in government troops to quell long-running protests in the Thai capital last May. Ninety-one people died and hundreds were injured in the street battles that followed.

"The problem rooted from political conflict is another problem  which is still severe," Abhisit said in his recorded address Monday. "Absolutely, asked if there is reconciliation, I have to say 'not yet.'"
