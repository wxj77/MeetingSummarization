(CNN)The smallest of clues can help to crack a case.

That's what authorities in Oklahoma are hoping in the 34-year-old murder of Tracey Neilson.

They've released images of an old cable repair ticket book, and are asking for the public's help in identifying the owner of that book.

The last ticket in the book is for work done at Neilson's home the morning she was murdered -- January 5, 1981. She was celebrating her 21st birthday that day.

"At 5 o'clock that evening, Jeff Neilson, Tracey's husband of only five months, found her dead inside their apartment at the Jamestown Square Apartments in Moore," the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.

"Tracey had been stabbed numerous times. Moore police responded to the scene and began investigating. The next day, the Moore Police Department requested OSBI assistance with the case. During the next 34 years, dozens of OSBI agents would work on the case." They followed more than 1,500 leads, the statement said.

On a bottom corner of the book is a box for an employee name. Authorities want to identify the three letters written in that box.

They are offering up to $11,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who killed Neilson.
