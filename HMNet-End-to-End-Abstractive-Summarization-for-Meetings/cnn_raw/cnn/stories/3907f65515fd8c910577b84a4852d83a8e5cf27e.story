(CNN) -- Johnny Grant, Hollywood's honorary mayor, was found dead Wednesday night, Los Angeles police said. Grant, 84, appeared to have died of natural causes.

Johnny Grant, shown last October, was a radio personality and television producer.

Authorities found him in his bed at the Roosevelt Hotel, where he lived, about 7 p.m. Pacific Time (10 p.m. ET), said Los Angeles Police Officer Jason Lee.

Grant last conversed with his business manager Wednesday afternoon and said he was feeling "lousy," said Jim Harper, who had managed Grant for 60 years.

A radio personality and television producer, Grant was best known as the honorary mayor of Tinseltown. It was a ceremonial position bestowed upon him for enthusiastically supporting the community for half a century.

Grant was chair of the committee that selected stars for the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was a familiar face in the foreground when celebrities immortalized their handprints in cement outside the Grauman's Chinese Theatre. E-mail to a friend
