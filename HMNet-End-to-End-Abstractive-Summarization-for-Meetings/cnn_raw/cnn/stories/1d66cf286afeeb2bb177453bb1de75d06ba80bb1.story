(CNN) -- CNN gave you the chance to pitch your questions to Team USA's goalkeeper Tim Howard recently and now he has answered.

The U.S. are hopeful of glory in South Africa where English Premier League star Howard will be helping his team do battle against England, Algeria and Slovenia in World Cup Group C.

Play the video at the top of the page to find out what motivates Howard ahead of the South Africa tournament, whether the goalkeeper thinks the form of his side from the Confederations Cup can be continued and if there is "smack-talk" between the Everton teammates who are Africa-bound.

The 31-year-old also tells CNN's Pedro Pinto about his thoughts regarding a move back to Major League Soccer (MLS) and which striker he fears most in the world.

Born in North Brunswick, New Jersey former Manchester United goalkeeper Howard has won 29 caps for USA.

Having replaced France's Fabien Barthez at Old Trafford, 6'2" Howard moved to Everton in February 2007 for $4.67 million where he has now made 138 appearances.

USA finished top of the CONCACAF qualifying group -- where Howard's former Everton teammate Landon Donovan set a new USA record for World Cup qualifying goals scored by contributing to his side's 2-1 win against Honduras.

He scored in the away game against Honduras to seal a 3-2 victory and secure a place at the World Cup finals.

This is now USA's sixth consecutive World Cup finals appearance and many are expecting the side to go far.
