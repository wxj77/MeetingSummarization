(EW.com) -- EW has confirmed that embattled indie "Killer Joe" has set a release date, as Deadline first reported.

Matthew McConaughey's trailer-park noir found itself in an appeals imbroglio this March when the MPAA slapped an NC-17 rating on it for scenes involving drug use, nudity, violence, and graphic sexuality, to name a few. Despite losing that fight, "Joe" will hit theaters unchanged on July 27.

William Friedkin directed the film based on Pulitzer winner Tracy Letts' play. McConaughey plays the title character, a police officer who works overtime as a hitman.

A small-time drug dealer (Emile Hirsch) solicits Joe's services to off his mother for her insurance money, and Joe takes a special liking to the dealer's younger sister (Juno Temple). Gina Gershon, and Thomas Haden Church also star.
