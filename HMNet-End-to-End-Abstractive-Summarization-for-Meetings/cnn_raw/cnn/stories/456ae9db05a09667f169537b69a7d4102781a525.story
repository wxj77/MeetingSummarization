(CNN) -- Hollywood actor Antonio Banderas is to sponsor a new Moto2 motorcycling team for the 2010 season, which will be called Jack&Jones by Antonio Banderas, the official Moto GP Web site has reported.

The team will compete in the Moto2 world championship, the series below motorcycling's elite MotoGP series, with the first race of the season in Qatar on April 11.

Riders Kenny Noyes and Joan Olive will be on board Promoharris prototypes for the team's debut season.

Banderas is a well-known motorcycling enthusiast, but this is his first sport-related business venture.

He told www.motogp.com: "I want to be involved with the team where the riders, both Joan and Kenny, have everything they need to compete at the highest level.

"I will go to every race I can, but obviously this depends on my professional workload with film and theatre.

"I am a motorcycle lover, and I've been a big fan in recent years. This gave me the opportunity to compete on the inside and I didn't have to think about it!"

Speaking about the Moto2 category, Banderas added: "I think it's very interesting and that we're really going to see the true qualities of the riders.

"Everyone has the same engine, which is very powerful and will underline the skill of every team and their technical staff. They will have the opportunity to advance the bikes as they look for the perfect balance for the riders."
