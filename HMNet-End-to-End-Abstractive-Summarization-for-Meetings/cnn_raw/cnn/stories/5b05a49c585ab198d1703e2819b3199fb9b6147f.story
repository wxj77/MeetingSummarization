Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- An elections board certified Kasim Reed on Saturday as the winner of the Atlanta mayoral runoff election by a margin of 620 votes.

Barry Garner, director of Fulton County's elections board, told CNN on Saturday that former state senator Reed was declared the winner of last Tuesday's runoff election against City Councilwoman Mary Norwood.

Garner said Reed received 42,348 votes compared with Norwood's 41,728.

Norwood has until 5 p.m. Tuesday to request a recount, Garner said. He said if a recount is requested, it will begin Wednesday morning.

In the initial vote among eight contenders, Norwood received 45 percent of the votes to Kasim Reed's 37 percent. Lisa Borders came in a distant third with 14 percent of the vote, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

A candidate needs 50 percent plus one vote to avert a runoff.

CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.
