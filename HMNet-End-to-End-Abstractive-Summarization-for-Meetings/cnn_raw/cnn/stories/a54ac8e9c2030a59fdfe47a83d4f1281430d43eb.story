(CNN) -- A World War II-era bomb was discovered in London's Olympic Park on Monday, hours after the closing concert of a sporting competition for wounded and ill veterans sponsored by members of Britain's royal family.

Although the bomb turned out to be inert and alerts were later dropped, police say it did require evacuations of residents and schools near the park, which was converted to public use after the 2012 London Olympics.

The park was also the scene Sunday of the closing concert of the Invictus Games.

Britain's Prince Harry founded the games.

The bomb was found at the international broadcast center in the park. It wasn't immediately known how it was discovered.

Unexploded ordnance is not uncommon in Great Britain, which was not only the scene of German air raids during World War II, but essentially also an enormous armed encampment, training ground and ammunition depot during World War II.
