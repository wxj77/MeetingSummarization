London (CNN) -- Prince William and Kate Middleton will go on a royal tour of Canada in June and July, his office announced Wednesday. It will be the first official foreign trip for the couple after they marry in April.

They will visit Alberta, the Northwest Territories, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and the National Capital Region between June 30 and July 8, Clarence House said.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had extended the invitation for the tour upon hearing of the couple's engagement.

"Canada is delighted that Prince William and Miss Catherine Middleton will be travelling to Canada as they embark on their first overseas tour as a married couple. " Harper said.

"Canada looks forward to welcoming the young couple this summer and providing them with all that our country has to offer -- including, of course, the special hospitality and warmth reserved for members of the Royal Family."

Canada is seen as a safe bet for a royal debut as a married couple. Queen Elizabeth II, William's grandmother, remarked on her trip to Canada last year that for the royals, the country is a "home away from home."

William is second in line to the British throne.

The timing of the visit means they will not be attending the wedding of Prince Albert of Monaco on July 2.
