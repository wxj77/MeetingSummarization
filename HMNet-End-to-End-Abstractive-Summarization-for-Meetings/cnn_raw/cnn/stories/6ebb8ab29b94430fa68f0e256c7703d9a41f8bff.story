Miami (CNN) -- Rapper Rick Ross suffered medical emergencies aboard two separate flights, forcing both back to the ground, officials said Friday.

Ross was taken to a Florida hospital after he suffered an unidentified medical emergency on a Delta flight to Memphis a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN.

A Broward County Sheriff's Office fire rescue team met Delta Flight 1310 at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, said the source, who was not authorized to speak to the media.

"Ross was breathing and conscious and alert when we reached the passenger on the plane," said the source. "He was conscious on transport. He was assessed and transported to Broward General Medical Center."

The rapper later wrote on his Twitter account that he was headed to Memphis and posted a video with him on a plane, getting ready to take off.

His flight, however, was diverted to Birmingham, Alabama, according to CNN Memphis affiliate WMC.

The station reported that Ross had suffered a seizure and was hospitalized.

The University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital confirmed that it had an emergency room patient under the name of William Leonard Roberts.

Ross, born William Leonard Roberts II, is famous for songs such as "9 Piece."

He was scheduled to perform Friday night in Memphis, at the FedExForum, for the "Memphis Madness" event. The rapper missed that appearance, according to WMC.
