(Mashable) -- Facebook is testing a series of cosmetic changes to the top of users' Timelines, the company has confirmed.

Screenshots of the new design were posted on Talking Points Memo Tuesday morning. The images show a condensed version of Timeline, in which a user's details (name, occupation, education, location) appear in reverse type on top of â€” rather than below â€” the cover photo.

The carousel of thumbnail images highlighting friends, photos, places, likes, etc. has also been compressed. Images are now replaced by thumbnails. Next to these, a new "Summary" section appears, presumably to highlight key events on a user's Timeline.

It's not clear if the new design will give users greater control over the appearance of their Timelines. We're curious to know, for instance, whether users will be able to modify the color of the type that appears on top of their cover photos.

What do you think of the new design? Do you like the reverse type? Would you miss the thumbnail images if they were removed?
