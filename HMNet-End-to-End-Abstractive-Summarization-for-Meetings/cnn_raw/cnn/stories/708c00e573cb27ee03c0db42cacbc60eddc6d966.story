(EW.com) -- Make way, Angelina Jolie!

Former "Wicked" witch Kristin Chenoweth has signed on to play "Sleeping Beauty" baddie Maleficent in Disney's upcoming original movie "Descendants," which follows the teenage children of Disney's iconic heroes and villains (mainly the villains).

The Tony and Emmy winner will butt heads with her onscreen daughter Mal, played by "Liv and Maddie" star Dove Cameron.

Set to premiere in 2015, "Descendants" is Disney's newest experiment in transforming its famous animated characters into live-action figures. The cast of the adventure comedy DCOM (that's Disney Channel Original Movie) also includes Booboo Stewart as Jay, son of Jafar; Sofia Carson as Evie, daughter of the Evil Queen; Cameron Boyce as Carlos, son of Cruella de Vil; and Mitchell Hope as Ben, the son of Belle and the Beast.

In the film, the teenage progeny of Disney's most famous meanies are sent to the kingdom's hottest prep school alongside other notable offspring, including the children of the Fairy Godmother, Mulan, and Rapunzel, where they face a dilemma of nature vs. nurture (or, evil vs. relatively normal).

"High School Musical" director Kenny Ortega is on board to helm and direct the film, which is slated to begin production in late May.
