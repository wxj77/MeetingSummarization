Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky resoundingly won the straw poll at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference, cementing his status as among the favorites to capture the next Republican presidential nomination.

Paul captured 31% of the vote in the survey of CPAC attendees as to whom they would pick for president. It is the second straight such win for the Kentucky senator, who is the son of libertarian icon and former Rep. Ron Paul.

The next closest contender was Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas with 11%.

The top six was rounded out by neurosurgeon turned conservative firebrand Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.
