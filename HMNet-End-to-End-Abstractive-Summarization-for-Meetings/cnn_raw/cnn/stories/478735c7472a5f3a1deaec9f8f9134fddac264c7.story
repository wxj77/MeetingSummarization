(CNN)A "serious" shoulder injury to drummer Patrick Carney has led the Black Keys to cancel the upcoming European leg of their world tour.

The blues-rock band announced Friday that it's canceling 17 shows in France, Germany, the UK and other countries. The band hopes to resume the 2015 Turn Blue tour as scheduled April 2 in Brisbane, Australia.

"We are very sorry to have to cancel our upcoming performances through March 10. Patrick needs time to heal," co-founders Carney and guitarist Dan Auerbach said in a statement on the band's website. "We thank all of our fans for their support and we're looking forward to getting back on the road."

Efforts to reschedule the dates were unsuccessful because of prior commitments and venue availability, the band said. All tickets will be refunded in full at the point of purchase.

The circumstances around Carney's injury were not immediately disclosed, although it was described as "serious." The band had just posted a message on its site Wednesday saying it will headline a festival May 28 in Barcelona, Spain.

Formed in Akron, Ohio, in 2001, the Black Keys are essentially a duo -- Auerbach and Carney -- although they often supplement their live shows with other musicians. Their raw sound gradually built  them a devoted but modest following until "Brothers," their 2010 commercial breakthrough, brought a mainstream audience.

The band is best known for the hits "Lonely Boy" and "Gold on the Ceiling," from the 2011 "El Camino" album. They have won six Grammys and are up for three more this year, including best rock album for their latest, "Turn Blue."

The Black Keys were not scheduled to perform at the Grammy Awards, to be handed out February 8 in Los Angeles.

They said Friday that they do not expect any dates after March 10 to be canceled. The Black Keys also are scheduled to play a handful of music festivals this summer.
