Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Authorities have arrested five additional suspects connected with last week's kidnapping of major league baseball player Wilson Ramos, Venezuelan officials said Monday.

The five Colombian citizens are among 11 people detained in connection with the case, Venezuela's justice ministry said in a statement.

Investigators released few details about the arrests, but were scheduled to release more information about the case at a press conference Monday morning.

Security forces rescued Ramos on Friday in Montalban, a mountainous region about 60 miles from the north central Venezuelan town where gunmen kidnapped him two days earlier, state media reported.

Ramos, a rising star for the Washington Nationals as a rookie this past year, was in his native country to play in Venezuela's winter league.

But before his first game with the Aragua Tigers, gunmen kidnapped him Wednesday night from his mother's home in Santa Ines, a team spokeswoman said.
