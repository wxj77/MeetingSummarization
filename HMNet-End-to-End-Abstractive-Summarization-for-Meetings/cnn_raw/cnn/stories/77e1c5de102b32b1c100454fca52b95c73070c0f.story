(CNN) -- AC Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri is under increasing pressure following his side's third consecutive Serie A defeat.

Allegri, who has been forced to defend his side's wretched run of form, was left facing criticism once again after Udinese inflicted a 2-1 defeat on the Rossoneri.

Milan, who also had Cristian Zapata and Kevin Price- Boateng dismissed, fell behind to a Mathias Ranegie goal just before the interval.

Stephan El-Shaarawy fired home an equalizer from 25-yards before both Zapata and Prince-Boateng were dismissed.

Antonio Di Natale converted a penalty to earn Udinese their first league win of the season and leave Allegri fearing for his job.

Milan has won just one league game so far this season following defeats against Atalanta and Sampdoria.

It was a bad day for AC's city rivals Inter after it slumped to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat against Siena at the San Siro.

Siena, who arrived in Milan bottom of the table, took a 73rd minute lead through Simone Vergassola before Francesco Valiani sealed the win.

Sampdoria dropped their first points of the season after being held to a 1-1 draw by Torino at the Stadio Luigi Ferarris.

Rolando Bianchi put Torino ahead from the penalty spot before Nicola Pozzi also netted from 12-yards to secure a point.

Gian Piero Gaseperini suffered defeat in his first game as manager of Palermo after Atalanta recorded a 1-0 win.

The former Inter boss was unable to inspire Palermo to its first victory of the season as Cristian Raimondi's goal gave Atalanta all three points.

The game between Cagliari and Roma was called off after the president of the Sardinian club rejected local authority orders to exclude fans from their new stadium.

In the day's late game, Lazio surrendered its unbeaten league record after suffering a 1-0 home defeat against Genoa.
