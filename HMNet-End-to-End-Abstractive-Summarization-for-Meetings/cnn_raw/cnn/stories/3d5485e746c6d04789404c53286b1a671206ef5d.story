(CNN) -- Four-time African footballer of the year Samuel Eto'o has been banned for 15 games for his part in a players' strike, the Cameroon Football Federation has reported.

Cameroon's national team captain was accused of inciting teammates not to play in a friendly against Algeria last month amid a row over bonus payments.

The match in Algiers was eventually canceled.

Cameroon's players claimed they had not received money promised for playing in a four-nation tournament in Morocco the weekend before.

Eto'o, who joined Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala from Inter Milan in August in a multi-million dollar deal, was handed the toughest penalty, while vice captain Enoh Eyong, who plays for Ajax, received a two-match ban.

Tottenham Hotspur defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto was also fined $1,980 for not appearing at the tournament in Morocco despite being called up.

The players have 10 days to appeal the decision, the federation said.

Cameroon will now have to embark on their qualification campaigns for the 2013 African Nations Cup and the World Cup in 2014 without their captain and talisman.

The team also known as the "Indomitable Lions" failed to qualify for the African Cup in 2012, and were the first country to be knocked out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
