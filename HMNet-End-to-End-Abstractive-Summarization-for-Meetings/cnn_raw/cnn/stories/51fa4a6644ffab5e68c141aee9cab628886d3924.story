BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- A 12-year-old girl died Monday after she was struck by a warning shot fired as a vehicle accelerated toward an Iraqi police station, said the U.S.-led military coalition.

The incident occurred in Hurriya in Nineveh province, according to a news release from Multi-National Corp-Iraq. A vehicle accelerated as it approached the Hurriya police station, where coalition forces and Iraqi police were conducting security operations, it said.

"The coalition forces and Iraqi police waved and yelled for the vehicle to stop," the news release said. "After the vehicle failed to stop, coalition forces fired two warning rounds."

The girl, who was standing about 100 meters (about 328 feet) behind the vehicle, was hit by one of the rounds, the release said. Troops attempted to treat her at the scene, but she died while being transported to a hospital.

The incident was under investigation, the release said, adding that Col. Gary Volesky, commander of U.S. forces in Nineveh province, "expresses his condolences to the girl's family for the unfortunate accident."

The news release did not say what happened to the vehicle.
