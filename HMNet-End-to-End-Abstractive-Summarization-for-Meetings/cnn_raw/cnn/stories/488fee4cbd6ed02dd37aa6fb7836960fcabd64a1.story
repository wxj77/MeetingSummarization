(CNN) -- Comedian Tracy Morgan has been moved to a rehabilitation center to continue his recovery after a deadly traffic accident, his publicist said Friday.

"Tracy has been transferred to an undisclosed rehab center, where he is expected to remain for the next few weeks," according to Lewis Kay.

"While he is continuing to show signs of improvement, he still has a long way to go," Kay said in a statement.

Morgan was critically injured in a limo bus crash on the New Jersey Turnpike in the early morning hours of June 7.

The 45-year-old Morgan suffered broken ribs, a broken nose and a broken leg.

Morgan friend and fellow comedian James McNair was killed in the crash.

The semi-truck that rear-ended Morgan's limo was traveling 20 mph over the speed limit and its driver was almost at his drive time limit. That is the finding in a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board released Thursday.

Police said in a criminal complaint driver Kevin Roper had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the crash. The 35-year-old Roper has pleaded not guilty to charges that include vehicular homicide and assault by auto.

Roper is free on a $50,000 bond.

In the statement released Friday by his publicist, Morgan also said he and his fiancee Megan Wollover "wanted to publicly express their deepest gratitude to everyone at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital for the unbelievable care and attention they provided him."

Morgan was a regular on "Saturday Night Live" for seven years and later received an Emmy nomination for his role in the comedy series "30 Rock."
