(CNN) -- Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman in the prison where he is serving a 28-year sentence, his attorney told HLN, CNN's sister network, on Friday.

Van der Sloot, who remains the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of American Natalee Holloway, and his unnamed fiancÃ©e are working on completing the paperwork required for the wedding, said attorney Maximo Altez.

The couple hopes to be able to marry within the next two weeks, Altez said. They reportedly met while she was visiting another inmate at Miguel Castro Castro prison in San Juan de Lurigancho.

Joran van der Sloot challenges extradition to U.S.

Van der Sloot, 25, pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephany Flores, whose body was found in May 2010 in a Lima hotel room registered in the Dutchman's name.

He also has been indicted in the United States on charges related to the disappearance of Holloway.

Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama.

Van der Sloot was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance, but was never charged. He has denied responsibility for her disappearance.

In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of allegedly attempting to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment.

He was allegedly given $25,000, which authorities say he used to travel to Peru for a poker tournament.
