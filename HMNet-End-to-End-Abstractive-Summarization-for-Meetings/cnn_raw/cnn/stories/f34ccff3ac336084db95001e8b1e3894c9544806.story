(CNN Student News) -- December 6, 2013

Nelson Mandela, former leader of South Africa and "the world's most famous political prisoner," has died. In Friday's program, CNN Student News looks back at the life, legacy and accomplishments of this Nobel Peace Prize winner. We also remember the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, and we report on a strike by many American fast food workers and the response by the restaurant industry.
