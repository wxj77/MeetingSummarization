(CNN) -- A US Airways flight en route from Italy to the United States was diverted to Ireland after nine flight attendants became ill, officials said Saturday.

Responding to the medical complaints, the pilots switched gears over the Atlantic Ocean, making an emergency landing Saturday afternoon at Dublin Airport.

The nine flight attendants aboard US Airways Flight 715 complained of "nausea, running eyes and dizziness, while traveling from Venice to Philadelphia," Irish health officials said.

The flight attendants were evaluated, released and then returned to Philadelphia, according to US Airways spokeswoman Michelle Mohr.

A total of 185 passengers were on the flight.

There were no reports of illness from pilots or passengers, and they were put on other flights to Philadelphia, Mohr said.

According to flightaware.com, the plane is an Airbus A330-200.

Journalist Peter Taggart contributed to this report from Ireland.
