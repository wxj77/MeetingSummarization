(CNN) -- This month on Inside the Middle East, CNN's Nic Robertson travels to Libya to explore the Roman ruins of Leptus Magna. Meanwhile Arwa Damon looks at the lost treasures of Iraq and a controversial choice by a Kurdistan museum to pay smugglers in an effort to recover stolen artifacts.

Jordan's Gem

Hidden in mountains, built among stunning rock formations, Petra was once a prosperous trading hub. Today it's Jordan's historical gem, attracting nearly one million visitors a year. We explore the ancient site to find out what makes Petra so unique.

Cave Dwellers of Petra

We journey beyond the well-worn tourist paths, and meet the people who live, work and protect Petra. The local Bedouin community has called PetraÂ¹s caves home for generations. Living off of the land in a desert is by no means easy, but for the Bedouins, Petra is more than a place, itÂ¹s a large part of their identity.

A Roman City in Libya

CNN's Nic Robertson visits Leptus Magna, Roman ruins beyond comparison with any location in Europe. Thanks to local residents and police, during recent violence nothing was stolen, as a community banded together to preserve their heritage.

Lost Treasures of Iraq

Iraq's National Museum lost around 15,000 artifacts from which only 1000 have been recovered. Now the second largest museum in the northern part of Kurdistan has made the difficult and controversial choice to pay smugglers for stolen artifacts. Arwa Damon reports.
