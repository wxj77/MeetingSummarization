(EW.com) -- "Breaking Bad" musical? Eh, we've seen that before. But a "Breaking Bad" opera? Now that's something we didn't expect.

One World Symphony's artistic director and conductor Sung Jin Hong has confirmed that he's working on composing "Breaking Bad â€” Ozymandias," a mini-opera based on both the show itself and the Percy Bysshe Shelley's sonnet (titled "Ozymandias").

Although specifics are yet to be released, Hong wrote a blog explaining that the mini-opera hopes to "explore the question that the drama obsessively and hauntingly asked: 'are we all breaking bad?'"

"Breaking Bad â€” Ozymandias" will run through One World Symphony's Addiction program on January 26-27, 2014.

So what suggestions do you all have for Hong? We're thinking Saul needs his own dance number, and Badger should sing his latest "Star Trek" pitch.

And obviously, Huell gets a solo about sitting alone in a hotel room with nothing but his thoughts for, like, ever.

Or maybe we're on the wrong track. Bottom line: Would you go see a "Breaking Bad" mini-opera?
