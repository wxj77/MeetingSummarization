(CNN) -- Tiger Woods will be reunited with his former caddy at next week's U.S. Open after the world's top three golfers were paired together in the opening two rounds in Pennsylvania.

The dream trio of Woods, Rory McIlroy and Masters winner Adam Scott will tee off from the first hole at the Merion Golf Club on Thursday at 1:14 p.m. local time and then at 7:44 a.m. on the 11th hole on Friday, the United States Golf Association said.

It prompted the slumping McIlroy to take to twitter, writing "Decent group for the first 2 rounds at Merion I see...."

Woods split with his caddy, Steve Williams, in 2011 in a move that left the New Zealander in "shock." Williams was beside Woods for 13 of his 14 major titles but now works with Scott.

Williams later in 2011 apologized for making a racist remark aimed at Woods and this year reportedly said Woods should have been disqualified for an illegal drop at the Masters.

There's more intrigue because Woods is firmly against anchored putting -- while anchored putting helped Scott claim his first major at Augusta in April.

Last month, golf's governing bodies ruled that the use of anchored putters will be banned from 2016.

Although he is the world No. 1, Woods hasn't won a major since the 2008 U.S. Open. World No. 2 McIlroy, meanwhile, missed the cut at last month's PGA Championship in Wentworth, England, the flagship event on the European Tour.

He barely made the cut at last week's Memorial in Ohio.
