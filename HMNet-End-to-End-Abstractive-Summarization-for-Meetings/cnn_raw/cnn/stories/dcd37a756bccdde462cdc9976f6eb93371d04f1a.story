(RollingStone.com) -- Marianne Faithfull said in a recent interview that her boyfriend at the time, a heroin dealer named Jean de Breteuil, was responsible for Doors frontman Jim Morrison's death in the summer of 1971.

The singer recalled a sense of foreboding when Breteuil told her he intended to visit the Doors frontman so she decided to stay at their hotel and take barbiturates. "He went to see Jim Morrison and killed him," Faithfull told Mojo. "I mean, I'm sure it was an accident. Poor bastard. The smack was too strong? Yeah. And he died. And I didn't know anything about this. Anyway, everybody connected to the death of this poor guy is dead now. Except me."

In the same interview, Faithfull also discussed the fate of Amy Winehouse, another singer who died at age 27 of a drug overdose. "Amy was very, very wary of me," Faithfull said. "She knew that I knew and she didn't want me to say anything. There's a level of narcissism which is all mixed up with self-hatred. I know it well.... But I can't think what I could have done apart from take her and shake her! 'You stupid little c**t! Wake up!'" Faithfull said she was "appalled" by the younger singer's death.

In September, Faithfull will release a new record, "Give My Love to London," which features songwriting collaborations with Roger Waters, Nick Cave, Steve Earle, Anna Calvi, Tom McRae and more. Her backing band on the record features members of Cave's Bad Seeds and Portishead's Adrian Utley. She also plans on publishing a book of photos from throughout her career with autobiographical captions, "Marianne Faithfull: A Life on Record," in October.
