(CNN) -- Passengers were evacuated from a Delta aircraft after smoke began coming from the wheel area, after it landed at Atlanta's airport Saturday afternoon, a witnesses and company official said.

Flight 2284 had just arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport from Pittsburgh, around 4:14 p.m. when the incident occurred, said Delta spokeswoman Leslie Parker.

Parker said the plane's brakes overheated, causing smoke. According to Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen, one of the plane's tires blew out.

"After (the plane) landed there was a big boom, and then just a line of smoke," Kalel Dunst, who saw the incident from a hotel room nearby, told CNN. "It turned off the runway, and the fire got a lot bigger."

According to Parker, none of the 44 passengers or five crew members on board were injured. All were safely evacuated and bussed to the terminal. She said they departed the plane by slides, though Bergen said they took the back stairs.

The aircraft -- an MD 88 -- will be taken out of service and evaluated, the Delta spokeswoman said.
