(CNN) -- Good luck recognizing Kevin Smith these days.

The director and sometime actor has not only slimmed down, he also shaved, which has left him looking decidedly less Kevin Smith-like.

According to his Instagram account, Smith has lost 20 pounds after going off added and processed sugars for a few weeks.

"Day 17 of no added or processed sugar. Down 20 pounds. Feeling so good, I'm hiking the hills with my wiener out," read the caption on a photo of him walking his dachshund.

Not content to stop at the weight loss, Smith also shaved his famous beard.

"Look at this goofy spaz," Smith wrote on Instagram. "This is me, beardless, for the #YogaHosers green screen shoot. #FaceBrazilian."

"Yoga Hosers" is a new film written and directed by Smith. IMDb describes the plot as "Two teenage yoga enthusiasts team up with a legendary man-hunter to battle with an ancient evil presence that is threatening their major party plans." The film is set for a 2015 release.

The director isn't the only well-known person to shed some weight lately.

According to the New York Daily News, the Rev. Al Sharpton has shrunk from a high of 305 pounds to recently weighing in at 129.6 pounds.

The activist and commentator said he got the weight off by cutting out red meat and then most other foods until he got down to just having tea, toast and juice for breakfast and fruit, tea and a salad with a hard-boiled egg at lunch. Like Smith, he exercises and stays away from added and processed sugars.

Sharpton found that the less he ate, the less he missed food.

"I could take all the cartoons in the tabloid newspapers, but I couldn't take my daughter punching me in the belly and asking why I was so fat," he told the paper. "That was my inspiration to lose the weight. And probably the last time anyone hurt my feelings."
