(CNN) -- Dina Lohan, mother of actress Lindsay Lohan, entered a guilty plea to drunken driving and speeding charges in a Long Island, New York, court Tuesday.

Lohan, 51, was arrested by New York State Police after a traffic stop last September.

She is expected to be sentenced June 3 to perform 100 hours of community service, attend a drunken driver program and a victim impact session, and pay $3,000 in fines and fees, according to Nassau County district attorney spokesman Paul Leonard.

Lohan's driver's license will be revoked and her car must have an interlock device -- which tests breath alcohol levels before a car can be started -- installed for a year under the plea agreement, Leonard said.

Lohan lawyer Mark Heller told CNN that she can resume driving once the interlock device is installed, even though her license remains officially revoked.

"Considering this is the first day of Passover, we were very pleased to receive an offer which would resolve her criminal case in Nassau County with a commitment of no jail, no probation, and that afforded her the opportunity to resume her driving privileges shortly," Heller said. "She felt this was a great beginning for the Holy week and she was happy with that result."

A test showed Lohan, who lives in Merrick, New York, had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.20, which is more than twice the legal limit, Leonard said.

The police report said Lohan was driving at 77 mph in a 55 mph zone before she was pulled over.

Lohan initially claimed that she had been injured during her arrest, but she recanted her statement after being evaluated by emergency personnel, who found no injuries.
