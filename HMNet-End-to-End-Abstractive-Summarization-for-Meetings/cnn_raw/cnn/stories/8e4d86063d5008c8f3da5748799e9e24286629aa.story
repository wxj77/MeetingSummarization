(CNN) -- Uncertainty over Inter Milan's coaching position ended on Friday as chairman Massimo Moratti announced that former Genoa boss Gian Piero Gasperini will be replacing Leonardo.

The 53-year-old, who guided Genoa into Serie A in 2007 before being sacked last November following a bad run of form, will sign a two-year deal at the San Siro.

He will be officially unveiled "as soon as the final bureaucratic formalities are completed" according to the Italian club's website.

Leonardo, who replaced Rafael Benitez in December 2010, is expected to take up a sporting director role with France's Paris St Germain -- a former club of his which has been recently bought by a Qatari group.

Could Villas-Boas succeed at Chelsea?

Club president Massimo Moratti expressed his "full satisfaction with the choice" and the 67-year-old wished his new employee "the success that brought Inter the title of world champions."

While Benitez took Inter to the FIFA Club World Cup title, he was unable to successful follow on the exploits of Jose Mourinho -- who took Inter to an unprecedented treble in 2009-10, winning the European Champions League plus a domestic double.

Under Leonardo, Inter finished runners-up to city rivals AC Milan in Serie A last season and claimed a seventh Coppa Italia crown.

A World Cup winner with Brazil in 1994, the 41-year-old had been a surprise choice after both playing for and coaching Milan.

Moratti and Inter have reportedly suffered setbacks in their search for a new boss, with former Chile national team coach Marcelo Bielsa rumored to have been approached regarding the position.

Andre-Villas Boas was another coach linked with the post, but the 33-year-old has now been appointed manager of English Premier League club Chelsea.

England coach Fabio Capello, who has twice been in charge of Milan, was also linked with a move to Inter.
