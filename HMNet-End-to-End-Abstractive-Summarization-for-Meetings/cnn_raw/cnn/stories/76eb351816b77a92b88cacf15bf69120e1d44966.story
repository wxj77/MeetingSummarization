4 men sentenced to death in New Delhi gang rape case

Violent crimes against women have been in the spotlight in India since a 23-year-old woman was raped and beaten by several men on a bus in December 2012.

The victim later died in a Singapore hospital. The shocking attack provoked outrage across India, leading to calls for improved safety and treatment of women.

Since then, the Indian media have intensified their focus on rape cases. Attacks against foreign women have also been reported.

Last year, six men were sentenced to life in prison for the rape and robbery of a Swiss woman in central India.

The girl whose rape changed a country

The Swiss woman and her husband were on a cycling tour across India in March and had set up camp near a forest. A group of men from a local tribe assaulted them, beating the husband and raping the wife.

The couple decided to stay in India to pursue charges against the men.

Earlier this month, a Polish woman told police that she was abducted at knife point in in Mathura, south of New Delhi, by a taxi driver who later drugged and raped her, according to IBN. The woman said that when she awoke, she was in the Nizamuddin area of New Delhi.
