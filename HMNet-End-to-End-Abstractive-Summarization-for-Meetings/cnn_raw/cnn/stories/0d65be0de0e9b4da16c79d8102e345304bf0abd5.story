(CNN Student News) -- September 24, 2013

As world leaders gather in New York, CNN Student News defines the U.N. General Assembly, and we consider the possibility of a meeting between the U.S. and Iran. We also report on terrorist attacks in Africa and Asia, and we examine election results in Germany. Plus, we share some students' opinions on the issue of bringing guns into Starbucks.
