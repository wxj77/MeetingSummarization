(CNN) -- So very many places to go, yet so little time to pore over the options.

It's summer vacation planning season and travel recommendation site Gogobot's users have whittled down the long list of possibilities by homing in on their favorites. On Tuesday, Gogobot released its top picks in two categories -- best natural wonders and best guided tours -- based on survey responses and nominations from its community of 2.5 million registered users, as well as reviews posted in the last 12 months for each destination or tour.

The best-of lists are part of Gogobot's annual Travelers' Favorite Awards.

"We really want to pique people's curiosity and help them discover places they might not have thought about or might not have heard of that they'd find really fun," said Travis Katz, Gogobot CEO and co-founder.

In the guided tours category, those ideas include the Seattle Underground Tour, which takes visitors through parts of Seattle buildings that were largely built over after the Great Fire of 1889.

The top pick in the natural wonders category is far more visible, especially from the beaches of Waikiki: Diamond Head State Monument in Honolulu tops the list, followed by the Grand Canyon, Northern California's Muir Woods and other awe-inspiring natural sites in the United States and beyond.
