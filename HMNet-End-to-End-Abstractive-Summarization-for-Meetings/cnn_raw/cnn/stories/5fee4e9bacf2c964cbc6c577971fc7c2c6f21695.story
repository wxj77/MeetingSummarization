(CNN) -- The editor of the Irish Daily Star resigned Saturday "as a result of the publication on 15 September 2012," which revealed topless photos of the duchess of Cambridge, according to a statement from the paper.

The images showed Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, sunbathing, igniting a firestorm of controversy in the British media and stern comments from Buckingham Palace.

Michael O'Kane had been suspended earlier, following the publication.

Palace officials quickly blasted the images and their publication in what they called a "grotesque" invasion of privacy.

The grainy pictures appear to have been taken with a long camera lens while the duchess and her husband Prince William were staying at a private chateau in Provence in southern France

St. James's Palace officials said in September that they "believe a red line has been crossed." The palace confirmed that the couple is taking legal action.
