(CNN) -- Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Arsenal striker Robin Van Persie, the club announced on Wednesday night.

"Manchester United is pleased to announce it has reached agreement with Arsenal Football Club for the transfer of Robin Van Persie," said a statement on the club's website.

"The deal is subject to a medical and the agreement of personal terms. A further announcement will be made in due course."

Arsenal's website confirmed that the Dutch striker, who scored 30 goals in 38 games for the London side last season, "will travel to Manchester on Thursday in order to agree personal terms and complete a medical ahead of a proposed move."

In July, Van Persie stunned Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger with a statement on his personal website that stated his "goal has been to win trophies with the team" and attempt to return the club to "its glory days."

The Dutch striker explained that following a meeting with the Wenger and the Arsenal chairman, Ivan Gazidis, "it has again become clear to me that we, in many aspects, disagree on the way Arsenal should move forward."

With a year left on his contract, after which Van Persie could move to another club for free, the statement was understood be a public declaration of the striker's intent to leave this summer.

Manchester United star Wayne Rooney has previously described Van Persie as "a fantastic player" and discussed the prospect of linking up with him at United.

"He's been amazing for Arsenal over many years. If he does come here, he would be a great addition to the squad."

Last summer saw Arsenal lose two of their start players, Samir Nasri to rivals Manchester City and club captain Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona.

Van Persie was appointed Arsenal captain last season after the departure of Fabregas. Coincidentally, Fabregas moved on the same date last summer - August 15th - as Arsenal agreed a fee for Van Persie this summer.
