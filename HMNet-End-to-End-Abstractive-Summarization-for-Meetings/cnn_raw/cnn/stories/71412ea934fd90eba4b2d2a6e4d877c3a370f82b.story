(CNN) -- Strike up that "Pink Panther" theme song and hum along: Da-dum-da-dum, da-dum, da-dum-da-dum-da-dum.

Because the closest thing ever to the fictional Pink Panther diamond that sent bumbling Inspector Clouseau on cinematic goose chases is going under the gavel this year.

And it is expected to fetch the highest price in history for any diamond ever purchased, says auctioneer Sotheby's.

By the time the bidding battle ceases on November 13, in Geneva, Switzerland, the chunk of pink ice known as (drum roll) The Pink Star is expected to be SOLD! for more than 60 million smackeroos.

The fictitious Pink Panther had a flaw that looked like a lunging panther, thus its name. The Pink Star, on the other hand, is flawless. Sotheby's calls it "the largest internally flawless fancy vivid pink diamond that the Gemological Institute of America has ever graded."

That's supposed to be very rare.

The rock the size of the pope's ring is 59.6 carats huge.

It took two years to cut its dozens of facets out of the original raw stone and polish it into its current oval shape.

CNN's Samira Said contributed to this report.
