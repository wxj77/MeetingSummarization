(EW.com) -- The Kardashians are already a staple on E! Network.

But they've chosen the month of November to assert their dominance on the book world. Earlier this month, "momager" Kris Jenner's released her memoir. Kourtney, Kim, and KhloÃ©'s first novel, "Dollhouse," hits shelves today. And next week fans will be treated to the re-release of "Kardashian Konfidential."

"Dollhouse," the first fiction endeavor from the Kardashians, follows sisters Kamille, Kassidy, and Kyle Romero. And like all the other Kardashian books, I read it so you don't have to! Here's a short plot summary. Warning: spoilers ahead!

The Romero girls live in California where their mother, Kat, owns a family restaurant. Their father, David, made some shady investments prior to his untimely death and left his family broke. Kat remarried Beau, a retired baseball player, who has two children from a previous marriage. The girls are essentially trying to make ends meet by helping out at the restaurant.

Everything changes when Kamille is discovered by a modeling agent. She becomes famous overnight, and begins dating a professional baseball player she meets at one of her many red-carpet appearances. Their whirlwind romance eventually becomes a whirlwind engagement when Kamille and her fiance agree to have their pending nuptials and wedding filmed for a TV show.

Kassie just adds to the family drama after she gets pregnant after a one-night stand with Kamille's fiance. Ooops! And I'd be remiss without mentioning the taboo attraction between Kyle and her step-brother. Those are just the highlights, people. I won't spoil all of the novel for you.

"Dollhouse" is fiction, but there are clearly some parallels between the lives of the Kardashians and Romeros. And in light of Kim's divorce, it's entertaining to read about a celebrity fairy-tale wedding filmed for TV. (You'll have to read to see whether the marriage lasts longer than 72 days...) All in all, "Dollhouse" is just Kardashian camp packaged in a neat novel. It's completely ridiculous, but entertaining nonetheless. And with the Kardashians I wouldn't expect any less.
