(CNN)  -- China continued their domination in the swimming pool at the 16th Asian Games, claiming five of the six golds on offer on the second day as 14-year-old Ye Shi Wen announced her arrival on the world stage.

The much talked about teenager thrashed the opposition to win the women's 400m individual medley by more than four seconds.

She touched in four minutes 33.79 seconds to leave compatriot and Asian record holder Li Xuanxu with silver. Taiwan's Cheng Wan-jung took bronze.

Ye is tipped for future stardom and is already targeting next year's world championships and the 2012 London Olympics.

"This is the first time that I have won a gold medal at such a big event, so it means a lot to me and my family," she told AFP

Ye won the 200m medley at China's national championships earlier this year and won three World Cup races in Beijing last month.

By the finish of the second day of competition in Guangzhou, the hosts were well clear in the medals table with 37 golds, with Korea next best on 13.

China's women's gymnasts duly emulated the gold medal of their male counterparts in the team competition, their 10th successive victory at the Asiad.

Japan took the silver and Uzbekistan the bronze.

The Asian Games has an eclectic mix of sports and dance sport is debuting with the hosts also proving their dominance in the ballroom.

They added five more titles to the five they collected on the previous day.

India's first gold came for Pankaj Advani as he won the singles title in the English Billiard competition.
