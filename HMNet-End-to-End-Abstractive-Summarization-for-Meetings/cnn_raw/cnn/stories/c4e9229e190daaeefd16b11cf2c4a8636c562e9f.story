(CNN) -- What's your excuse for not voting? You moved and forgot to change your address? Couldn't get out of work on time? You don't care about the issues?

Rapper Lil Jon put you all to shame by jumping on a plane so he could turn out to vote in his home district in Atlanta.

Lil Jon, who is registered to vote under his real name, Jonathan Smith, emphatically announced Tuesday in an all-caps message on social media that he was on a 6 a.m. flight from Los Angeles to Atlanta.

He said Georgia never sent him an absentee ballot after he requested one on Oct. 9, despite "numerous calls."

In Atlanta, Fulton County Elections Director Richard Barron said the rapper's request for an absentee ballot came in Friday, October 24.

The department sent out the absentee ballot via U.S. Postal Service on Monday, October 27, Barron said. He was unable to confirm whether Lil Jon received the absentee ballot, because the department does not track the status of mailed ballots.

Luckily for Lil Jon, he had the means to hop on a last-minute flight to his polling station. A few hours later, he posted an image on Instagram of him proudly wearing his "I'm a Georgia Voter" sticker.

Lil Jon is not the only person with complaints (legitimate or not) about Georgia's voting system. The office of Georgia's secretary of state confirmed Tuesday that its website has been experiencing intermittent problems on Election Day.

It would have looked pretty bad if Lil Jon didn't make it to the polls. As a spokesman for Rock the Vote, he appeared in a get-out-the-vote music video, "Turn Out for What," a remix of his hit song "Turn Down for What."
