(CNN) -- Goal machine Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Real Madrid won 3-2 at Real Betis in the Spanish Primera Liga on Saturday -- their 11th victory in a row.

But it was far from easy for Jose Mourinho's league leaders, who trailed to an early goal in his 100th game in charge of the Spanish giants.

Jorge Molina scored on nine minutes for Betis after a superb move before Gonzalo Higuain drew Real level in the 25th minute with an empathic strike.

La Liga's top scorer Ronaldo put Real ahead after the break but Jefferson Montero grabbed a deserved equalizer before the hour mark.

Ronaldo sealed the win with a close range strike in the 72nd minute with his 32nd goal of the league season.

There was still time for Betis to pressure the Real goal and they had strong penalty appeals turned away in injury time as Sergio Ramos appeared to block a shot with his arm.

Real Madrid lead Barcelona by 13 points but the defending champions can cut the gap to 10 with victory away to Racing Santander.

Meanwhile in Serie A, AS Roma improved their chance of European qualification with a hard-fought 1-0 victory at Palermo.

Fabio Borini's eventual winner came after just three minutes as Roma moved above Inter Milan into sixth place.

It was a vital win for coach Luis Enrique after their derby defeat to bitter capital rivals Lazio last week.
