(CNN) -- Authorities along the central coast of California are searching for a missing boy they believe was snatched from the shelter where he was staying by another resident.

Police issued an Amber Alert Friday for 4-year-old Jeremy Guthrie, who is thought to be wearing a camouflage shirt and bright blue underpants.

"Very dynamic situation as you can imagine. We're mobilizing every possible, every imaginable resource to find Jeremy. Unfortunately, we have not been successful at this point," said Steve Gesell, interim police chief.

Jeremy and his mother had been staying at the First Baptist Church Shelter in Atascadero, California, police said in a statement. He was last seen around 9 p.m. Thursday and may have been abducted around 4:30 a.m. Friday, when a door alarm sounded, they said.

The mother of the boy told police he could have been taken by Annette Hale, 52, who was also staying at the shelter. The two women had a disagreement Thursday night, said Gesell.

"A witness was reported to have heard a little boy say 'I don't want to go,' or something similar to that, and we have an eyewitness that believes they saw a woman holding what may have been Jeremy in a blanket as they left the building," he said.

Hale is around 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighs 200 pounds. She has brown hair, glasses and is not related to the missing boy. Gesell said she has a history of erratic behavior, but is not thought to be violent.

Jeremy was described by police as 3 feet, 5 inches tall with brown hair. He may have a blanket with him, they said.
