(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund restored their seven-point lead over Mainz at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday after beating bottom-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach 4-1.

Dortmund went a goal down in the 33rd minute when Marco Reus scored for the visitors, but hit back with goals from Serbian defender Neven Subotic and Shinji Kagawa to open up a 2-1 lead.

Two more goals from midfielder Kevin Grosskreutz and Lucas Barrios late in the game wrapped up another impressive win.

Bayern Munich moved up to fifth place as they thrashed Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 at the Allianz Arena.

Anatoliy Tymoshchuk opened the scoring in the 29th minute for Bayern only for Frankfurt's Theofanis Gekas to cancel it out four minutes later.

But goals in the 59th minute by Thomas Mueller and Mario Gomez two minutes later ensured three points for the home side and Tymoshchuk claimed his second of the match shortly before the final whistle.

The win means the reigning champions are now unbeaten in seven matches but still trail leaders Dortmund by 14 points.

Jonathan Pitroipa and Mladen Petric gave Hamburg a two-goal cushion, before Christian Gentner pulled a goal back for Stuttgart.

But Ruud van Nistelrooy scored the hosts' fourth in the 60th minute to make sure of the victory.
