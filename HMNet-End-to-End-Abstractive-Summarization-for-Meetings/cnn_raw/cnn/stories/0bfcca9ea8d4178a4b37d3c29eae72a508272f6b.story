(CNN) -- Kelsey Grammer -- actor, producer, Twitter grammarian.

Grammer's verified Twitter account started on June 30 with the tweet, "It has come to my attention that the fine people of @Twitter have an egregious grammar problem. I'm here to help. #KelseyGrammerGrammar." Since then, the "Frasier" star has been true to his mission, correcting tweets.

When one fan tweeted "The movie 'Down Periscope' w/ Kelsey Grammer is one of my favorite movies. Its a movie I can watch over & over again. Deal with it" Grammer responded with "I'm honored you think so, but believe it should be *it's. #KelseyGrammerGrammar."

So far, the Twitterverse seems thrilled by the addition of yet another member of the informal Twitter grammar police. One person tweeted, "@KelseyGrammer, your hashtag #KelseyGrammerGrammar is the best thing ever (notice my correct use of your, not you're)!"

Even other celebs are chiming in on the fun.

"Star Trek" legend William Shatner tweeted, "Uh oh! Dad showed up. No more fun anymore. ;-) @KelseyGrammer @twitter."

So watch your p's and q's, people. You don't want to make Sideshow Bob mad.
