(CNN) -- Taylor Farms has recalled more than 5,000 pounds of broccoli salad kit products because of possible Listeria contamination, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.

The kits were shipped to distributors and delis for consumer purchase in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. They contain dressing in packets that are the subject of a Food and Drug Administration recall.

Last week, Listeria concerns prompted Reser's Fine Foods to recall some 109,000 cases of refrigerated ready-to-eat products.

Taylor Farms informed the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service that kits contained salad dressing subject to that recall.

There have been no reports of illnesses.

Recalled products include boxes labeled "TAYLOR FARMS BROCCOLI CRUNCH WITH BACON AND DRESSING," with the case codes 310151 or 310153, the USDA said in a statement. The products were produced on October 21, 22 and 23.

They bear the establishment number EST. 34522 inside the USDA mark of inspection.

The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection. Listeriosis typically affects older adults, pregnant women, infants and adults with compromised immune systems.

Symptoms include fever and muscle aches, and sometimes diarrhea or other gastrointestinal problems. Other symptoms can include headache, confusion and convulsions. It can be treated with antibiotics.
