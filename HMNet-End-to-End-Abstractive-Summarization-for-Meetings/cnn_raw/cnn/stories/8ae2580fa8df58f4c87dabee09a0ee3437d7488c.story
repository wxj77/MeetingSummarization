New York (CNN) -- Some chose coffee, others started the day with a Irish stout, but all were in full cheer Wednesday morning as fans watched the United States team score a last-minutes goal to defeat Algeria 1-0 in World Cup competition.

"They had so many chances. I'm just glad they finally pulled it out," one relieved fan said when the game ended.

"I was so hyperventilating," a woman who identified herself only as Sheryl said, wearing a U.S.A. outfit. Her husband, John, had given up.

"I thought it was going to wind up a tie. And from the 90th minute on I was, like, it's gonna be over, it's gonna be over. And somebody scored, I almost died. Unbelievable. The place went nuts," John said.

Tension grew as the game went into stoppage time 0-0. Fans watched the overhead screens nervously, fearing that once again the U.S. would disappoint in the World Cup.

But in the 91st minute, Landon Donovan knocked in a deflected ball. In open-early-morning bars, cheering evolved into pandemonium, and chants of "Landon Donovan" filled the room. Earlier near-misses were immediately forgotten.

As patrons filed out of one bar, the crowd took a more musical tone as they broke into a rendition of "America the Beautiful."

One enterprising man sold USA jerseys out of a suitcase in front of that bar. As soon as as Donovan scored, he hiked his prices from $5 to $15.

"Bring on the Germans," one fan said. "If you want to be the best, you have to beat the best. Germany: we want you!"

But with the United States topping its group, it will face Ghana next. The game will be on Saturday at 2 p.m. ET.
