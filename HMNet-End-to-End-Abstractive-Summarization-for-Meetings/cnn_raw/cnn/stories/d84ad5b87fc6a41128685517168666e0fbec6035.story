We know Eric Dane is on his way out of Grey's Anatomy, but could McSteamy be joining Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) in that big hospital in the sky?

Well, there's no way to say for sure, but things are certainly looking grim in this photo of a rough-looking Mark Sloane, tweeted by Patrick Dempsey. (It was later taken down at ABC's request, per Dempsey.)

For the record, Shonda Rhimes told EW earlier this week that viewers should assume nothing about Mark's fate in light of Dane's exit. In fact, the unique season opener she described puts even more up in the air than usual. "When we start the season, we are ahead enough in time where we see the outcome of lots of things. And in the second episode of the season, there's rewind — we go backwards — to where they're still in the forest," she said. "So you see what happened and in the next episode, you see how we get there."

So what do you say, readers? Is this part of the flashback? Or the "outcome" referenced above? Will Mark be in a coma? Die? Theorize below.

The premiere (complete with all the answers we seek!) airs Sept. 27.
