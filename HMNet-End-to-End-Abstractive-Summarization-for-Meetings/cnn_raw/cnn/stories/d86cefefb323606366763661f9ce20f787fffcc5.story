LONE GROVE, Oklahoma (CNN) -- A scene of devastation emerged Wednesday as circling helicopters broadcast images of housing developments smashed by tornadoes and severe storms that killed at least eight people in south-central Oklahoma Tuesday.

Rescue personnel search for potential trapped victims Wednesday in Lone Grove, Oklahoma.

Storms ripped roofs off several homes and left twisted metal and other debris scattered across the area.

Firefighters and emergency personnel were working with distressed residents.

"It just happened really quickly. The sky darkened up and turned really, really green," truck driver Bruce Mundy told CNN from a truck stop in Oklahoma City early Wednesday morning.  Watch aerial footage of destruction »

"It was just, like, one after another. As soon as you get calmed down there were more," he said.

The storms had moved out of the state Wednesday morning after at least three tornadoes touched down in central and southern Oklahoma Tuesday, the National Weather Service said Wednesday.

The one that hit Lone Grove at about 7:30 p.m. had an intensity of EF4 and winds of around 170 mph.

The Enhanced Fujita scale measures the intensity of a tornado and its wind speeds based on the type of damage caused and rates it between EF0 and EF5.

The first tornado, which hit Edmond between 2:30 p.m. and 3 p.m., had an intensity ranging between EF0 and EF2, the NWS said. The service has not been able to determine an intensity for another tornado that hit near Langston about an hour later.

In the aftermath of the storms, authorities acknowledged a heavy task ahead as emergency personnel and private citizens began the cleanup effort. iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video
