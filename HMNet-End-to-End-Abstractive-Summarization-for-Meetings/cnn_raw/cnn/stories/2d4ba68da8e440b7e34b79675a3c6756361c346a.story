President Barack Obama met Wednesday with Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state and potential Democratic successor, for about an hour in the Oval Office, a White House official said.

The event was not on Obama's schedule, and details on what the two discussed were scant.

"As is well known, President Obama and Secretary Clinton enjoy getting together in person on a regular basis. This afternoon they met privately in the Oval Office for about an hour to catch-up and enjoy an informal discussion on a wide range of issues," the White House official said.

Nick Merrill, Clinton's spokesman, told CNN in an email that her camp will "defer to the White House on any details."

It's the first time the two have met in person since August, when they both attended a party at the Martha's Vinyard home of Vernon Jordan, an aide to former President Bill Clinton. Obama was vacationing there with his family, and Clinton was there for a book signing event.

More recently, Clinton has backed Obama's decision to overhaul immigration rules and forestall deportations for the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens through executive action.

Clinton, who lost to Obama during the hard-fought 2008 battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, is expected to make a decision about whether she'll run again in early 2015.
