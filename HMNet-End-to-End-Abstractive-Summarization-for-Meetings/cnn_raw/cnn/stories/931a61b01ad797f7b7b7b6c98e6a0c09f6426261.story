(CNN) -- Honda has expanded an airbag recall worldwide, covering 2001 and 2002 Accord, Civic, Odyssey, CR-V, and selected 2002 Acura TL vehicles, the automaker said.

The recall also includes the Honda Pilot and Acura CL in the United States, and the Honda Inspire, Saber and Lagreat in Japan for the same model years.

On its Web site late Tuesday, Honda said the driver's airbag inflators might expand with too much pressure, which can cause the inflator casing to break and could lead to injury or death.

There have been 12 incidents related to an airbag inflator problem, Honda said.

The original recall was issued in July 2009, and included 2001 and 2002 Accords and Civics, as well as some 2002 model year Acura TL vehicles.

The global recall now covers more than 950,000 vehicles.

Honda said it will notify affected customers by mail and phone with instructions on how to have their vehicles inspected and updated at an authorized dealer.

Last month, Honda announced a separate recall of 646,000 2007 and 2008 Fit, City and Jazz models worldwide, after a fire hazard involving a power window switch resulted in a death in South Africa.
