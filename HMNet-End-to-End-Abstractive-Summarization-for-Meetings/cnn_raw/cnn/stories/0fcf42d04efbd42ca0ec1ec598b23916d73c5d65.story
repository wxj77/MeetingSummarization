Two of the four inmates who escaped through the ceiling in the shower of the Caddo County Jail in Anadarko, Oklahoma, this weekend have been captured, Caddo County Sheriff Gene Cain told CNN on Monday.

The two men, Dylan Ray Three Irons, 21, and Prime Brown, 23, were taken into custody in Chickasha, Oklahoma, the sheriff said, less than 20 miles away from the jail.

The men were spotted by Grady County District Attorney investigators as they were walking to a convenience store. Both men "appeared very wet and dirty," according to the Grady County Sheriff's Office.

The four inmates made a clean getaway Sunday after prying open a maintenance hatch in their shower -- the first escape from the 2-year-old Caddo County jail, Cain said.

They broke a lock on the hatch above the shower head, Cain told CNN affiliate KFOR-TV, and then moved through a crawl space until they reached a wall, where they knocked out concrete block or two. That got them to an unlocked door outside the jail area, Cain explained.

They apparently kept their clothes on in the shower. Four orange inmate uniforms were found outside the jail, CNN affiliate KOCO-TV reported.

Three of the men -- Three Irons, Brown and Anthony James Mendonca, 24 -- had been convicted of methamphetamine offenses and were awaiting transfer to a state prison.

The fourth escapee, 32-year-old Triston Cheadle, was awaiting trial on a federal gun charge, KOCO-TV reported.

Cheadle and Mendonca remain at large and are considered armed and dangerous.
