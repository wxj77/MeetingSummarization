(CNN) -- The death toll from the devastating tornado that ripped through Joplin, Missouri, last month has risen to 155, a city spokeswoman said Monday.

The previous death toll, reported on Friday, was 154.

The most recent death was Edmon A. Cooper, Joplin city spokeswoman Lynn Onstot said. Cooper died from injuries sustained during the May 22 tornado, Onstot said. No other details were immediately available.

The Joplin tornado was the deadliest single U.S. twister in more than 60 years, according to National Weather Service records. It left a 13-mile-long trail of destruction through the southwest Missouri city, stripping the bark from trees and smashing homes into unrecognizable rubble.
