(CNN)The flight crew of the Delta Air Lines plane that skidded into a fence at LaGuardia Airport last week cited brake issues during the landing, according to an update on Monday from the NTSB.

The crew said they did not sense any deceleration from the wheel brake upon landing, despite the auto brakes being set to "max," according to an ongoing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.

The runway appeared all white in the moments before landing, according to the report. They based their decision to land after receiving a brake action report of "good" from air traffic control, the NTSB said.

"The automatic spoilers did not deploy," the crew told the NTSB, "but that the first officer quickly deployed them manually."

The captain said he was unable to stop the aircraft from drifting left, according to the report.

The Boeing MD-88 sustained significant damage to the left wing, flight spoilers, the nose of the plane and the left wing fuel tank, according to the NTSB.

Delta Flight 1086 departed from Atlanta shortly after 9 a.m. Thursday. LaGuardia was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later.

The aircraft briefly circled New York because of issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m.

The plane slid off the runway with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters. Twenty three passengers received minor injuries, and others were transported to the hospital for evaluation.

An NTSB meteorologist is examining the weather conditions at the time of the accident, said the report.

The cause of the accident has not been determined.
