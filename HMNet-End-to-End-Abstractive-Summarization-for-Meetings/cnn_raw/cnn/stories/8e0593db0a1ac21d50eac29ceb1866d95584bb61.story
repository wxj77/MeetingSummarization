As South Africa holds a national day of prayer, CNN Student News shows how Nelson Mandela is being honored around the globe. We also report on the latest U.S. unemployment statistics, and we hear about the end of an ordeal involving an American detained in North Korea. Plus, we examine why companies compete to be involved with the World Cup.
