(CNN) -- Campaigns and outside spending groups have spent millions on get-out-the-vote efforts in the final days leading up to Election Day, but there's one thing money can't buy: perfect weather.

Rain is expected in parts of the country on Tuesday, while Maine is still recovering from a nasty winter storm over the weekend that forced the governor to declare a state of emergency.

Two major companies â€” Emera and Central Maine Power â€” reported a combined 85,000 customers who were experiencing power outages and restorations Tuesday morning.

Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who's locked in a tight three-way contest for his reelection, said Sunday he expected power restoration to take "several days." The state issued a list of five polling stations that had changed locations after the storm.

As for weather on Tuesday, rain stretches from Michigan to Texas because of a front that's slowly crawling across the country, according to a CNN forecast.

Heavy rain is possible for areas in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas -- the latter of which holds a key Senate race Tuesday between Republican Tom Cotton and incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor.
