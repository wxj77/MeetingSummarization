(CNN) -- Inter Milan has been hit with a $58,600 by UEFA after being found guilty of "improper conduct" following allegations its fans racially abused Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor.

The Togolese striker, who scored a precious away goal to take Tottenham through to the next round during last month's Europa League tie, appeared to be subjected to monkey chants, while a fan was also seen with an inflatable banana.

Inter won the match 4-1 but crashed out of Europe's second-tier competition on the away goals rule with Adebayor's strike proving crucial.

The Italian club was also charged with "insufficient organization" and "throwing of missiles and/or fireworks."

Inter has already been punished in domestic competition after the Italian football authorities found its fans guilty of racially abusing former players Mario Balotelli and Sulley Muntari, who now play for fierce rival AC Milan.

The club was fined $65,500 for the incident which took place in March, while it was also forced to pay out $22,700 after fans sang racist chants about Balotelli during a Serie A game against Chievo.

Inter is one of two Italian clubs to have been punished by UEFA for racist behavior this season with Lazio having been hit with four charges this campaign alone.

Lazio was punished with a $52,000 fine in February on the back of the $230,000 it was forced to pay for racist abuse and other offenses during two group stage games against Tottenham and Slovenian side Maribor.

Meanwhile, Benfica has been fined $41,000 for organizational problems and the conduct of its supporters during last month's Europa League clash against Bordeaux in Lisbon.
