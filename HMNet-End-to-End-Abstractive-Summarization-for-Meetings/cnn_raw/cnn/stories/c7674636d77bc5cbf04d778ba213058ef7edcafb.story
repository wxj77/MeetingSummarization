Los Angeles (CNN) -- Paramedics were called to Lindsay Lohan's Los Angeles hotel room when she did not wake up from a nap Friday morning, but the actress "is fine," her publicist said.

Lohan joked about the incident in a Twitter posting early Saturday:

"Note to self.. After working 85 hours in 4 days, and being up all night shooting, be very aware that you might pass out from exhaustion & 7 paramedics MIGHT show up @ your door.... Hopefully theyre cute. Otherwise it would be a real let down."

Lohan, 25, was simply sleeping after working "a grueling schedule the past few days," publicist Steve Honig said.

She is in the middle of filming the Lifetime movie "Liz & Dick" in which she portrays legendary actress Elizabeth Taylor.

"She was on set last night at 7 p.m. and worked through the night until 8 a.m. this morning," Honig said. "She took a nap before shooting her final scene. Producers were concerned when she did not come out of her room and called paramedics as a precaution."

Paramedics determined Lohan "is fine, but did suffer some exhaustion and dehydration."

Contrary to some media reports, she was not taken to a hospital, he said.

"She is resting now and is hoping to be back on set later this afternoon," he said.

The scare came a week after Lohan was involved in a car crash that sent her to a hospital emergency room.

Lohan has spent several stints in substance abuse rehab, jail and home confinement in the past five years. Her professional life has gotten back on track in recent months and her supervised probation, stemming from two drunken driving convictions, has been lifted.
