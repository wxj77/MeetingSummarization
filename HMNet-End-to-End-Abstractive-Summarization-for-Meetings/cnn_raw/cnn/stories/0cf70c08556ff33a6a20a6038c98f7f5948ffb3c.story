(CNN)  -- Former Argentina international defender Fernando Caceres is fighting for his life in a Buenos Aires hospital after being shot in the head during an armed robbery.

The 40-year-old Caceres, who played for Argentina in the 1994 World Cup, was gunned down as a gang tried to steal his BMW car in the early hours of Sunday morning.

A bullet has reportedly entered his head through his right eye, and he remains in a coma in a grave condition.

Caceres was visited by his former Boca Juniors teammate and national coach Diego Maradona, who clearly distressed, told reporters outside the hospital that crime was rife in the Argentine capital.

"This is a time bomb, going out is a constant danger," Maradona told television station TyCSports.

"This happens every day, nobody does anything and something must be done.

"Caceres is in the hands of God and I hope it helps," Maradona added.

The attack happened in the Fort Apache area of Buenos Aires, which is where Manchester City star Carlos Tevez grew up, and is notorious for high crime levels.

Players from two of his former clubs, Argentinos Juniors and Independiente displayed a banner of support for him ahead of their later match in the Argentine league on Sunday.

Caceres won the league title with River Plate in 1991 and the European Cup Winners Cup with Spanish side Real Zaragoza in 1995.

He played 24 games for Argentina, helping them to the Copa America in 1993 before appearing at the World Cup finals in the United States a year later.

Caceres ended his playing career at his original club of Argentinos Juniors in 2007 and has been coaching at Independiente.
