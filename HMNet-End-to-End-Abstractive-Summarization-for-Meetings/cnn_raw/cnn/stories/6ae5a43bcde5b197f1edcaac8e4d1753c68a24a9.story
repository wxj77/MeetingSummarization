(CNN) -- Turkey's mountain sculptures

The lava-rock moonscapes, fairy chimneys, cave dwellings and ancient Christian chapels of Turkey's Cappadocia region have long been a fascinating destination for backpackers and tourists.

Now, an Australian artist named Andrew Rodgers has unveiled a man-made addition to the region's remarkable landscape: a statue park called "Rhythms of Life."

Best seen from the vantage point of a hot-air balloon, the park consists of enormous sketches made of stone walls built in the shape of a horse, an ancient grinding mill and an ancient Hittite symbol.

More then 1,000 locals worked on the ambitious project. Ivan Watson reports from Turkey's interior.

Palestinian female race-car drivers

It's not what you would expect to see from eight Palestinian women in Ramallah on a Saturday afternoon: smoke billowing from underneath their cars, wheels spinning wildly, and screeching tires marking a race track with black marks.

These eight women are breaking every stereotype in the male-dominated world of car racing. Paula Hancocks meets 21-year-old Noor, who has wanted to be a race driver since she was 10, and is competing in her third race of the season.
