(CNN) -- American Wayne Odesnik has accepted "a voluntary provisional suspension" from tennis after pleading guilty to importing human growth hormone into Australia.

Odesnik, currently ranked 111th in the world, was heading for the Brisbane International tournament in January when he was stopped by customs officers.

The 24-year-old pleaded guilty to taking eight vials of human growth hormone into the country at Brisbane Magistrates Court and was hit with an $8,000 fine.

Odesnik has agreed to a temporary suspension, though he can decide return to the game at any time, and must wait to hear the findings of an independent tribunal after the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme has concluded its investigation of the case.

A statement on the International Tennis Federation Web site said: "Wayne Odesnik has accepted a voluntary provisional suspension from all events covered under the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme, including Grand Slam tournaments, ATP-sanctioned events and ITF-sanctioned tournaments.

"In accordance with normal policy, the ITF does not intend to make further comment on this matter until its resolution."
