(CNN) -- An upcoming documentary on Kurt Cobain has more than just cooperation from the rock legend's family.

It has the oversight of Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean, 22, as the project's executive producer.

Called "Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck," the documentary is the first to have the backing of Cobain's relatives. As a result, the film had complete access to Cobain's archive of personal and creative works, some of which has never before been seen.

Written, directed and produced by filmmaker Brett Morgen, "Montage of Heck" will be released by HBO in 2015. (HBO and CNN are both divisions of Time Warner.)

For Morgen, the documentary has been a labor of love and a long-running passion project.

"I started work on this project eight years ago," the filmmaker said in a statement. "Like most people, when I started, I figured there would be limited amounts of fresh material to unearth. However, once I stepped into Kurt's archive, I discovered over 200 hours of unreleased music and audio, a vast array of art projects (oil paintings, sculptures), countless hours of never-before-seen home movies, and over 4000 pages of writings that together help paint an intimate portrait of an artist who rarely revealed himself to the media."

Cobain was best known as the frontman of the seminal grunge group Nirvana, whose music came to define the early '90s and has remained heavily influential since. "Montage of Heck" will of course use plenty of the band's work throughout the film, including both songs and performances.

Speaking of the project to NME in 2013, Morgen said he envisioned "Montage of Heck" being like "this generation's 'The Wall' -- a mix of animation and live action that'll allow the audience to experience Kurt in a way they never have before."
