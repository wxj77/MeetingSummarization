New York (CNN) -- LeBron James addresses the off-season controversy over his decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to play for the Miami Heat in a 90-second video posted on YouTube by Nike.

"What should I do?" the NBA star asks rhetorically.

The video -- titled "Rise" -- begins on a set similar to the one James used to announce last summer he was leaving Cleveland, Ohio, for Miami, Florida.

The fast-paced video looks at different scenarios of what James could have done, including a cameo by "Miami Vice" TV star Don Johnson offering advice.

"You've got to deal with the heat, man," Johnson says. "Be patient. After a while the temperature drops and everything is free and easy."

James recites a portion of Maya Angelou's poem "Still I Rise."

"Should I be who you want me to be?" James asks as a basketball rolls off his fingertips and into a hoop.

"We're celebrating his courage to forge his own journey even when others may have disagreed with his decisions," Nike's vice president of global brand marketing, Davide Grasso, said in a news release.

Nike produced similar videos for Tiger Woods and Kobe Bryant after their involvement in extramarital affairs.

TNT will show the James video Tuesday night during its coverage of the NBA season opener between the Miami Heat and the Boston Celtics.
