(CNN)A  Palestinian man rammed into a cyclist and four Israeli border police while he was driving in Jerusalem on Friday, authorities and first responders said.

Witnesses said the man drove off the side of the road to hit his victims. They were taken to the hospital with light to moderate injuries.

Authorities are treating the incident as a terror attack, according to police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.

The suspect tried to escape, but was shot by a security guard and severely wounded before being taken into custody, police said.

Israeli police identified the attacker as a Palestinian man in his early 20s from East Jerusalem.

Hamas applauded the attack.

"Hamas movement blesses this heroic act and considers it a natural response to the Occupations crimes, Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman, posted on Facebook.
