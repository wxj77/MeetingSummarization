(CNN)Three years ago this week, singer Whitney Houston was found dead In a bathtub at a Los Angeles-area hotel.

Now, her only child, Bobbi Kristina Brown, is in a medically induced coma after she was found unresponsive in her suburban Atlanta townhouse -- also in a bathtub.

Houston's death was ruled an accidental drowning. But many questions remain about what happened to Brown.

The family isn't saying much. Neither are police, though they've said they're treating Brown's case as a criminal investigation.

Though little concrete information has surfaced, rampant rumors certainly have. The speculation prompted Brown's family to admonish some media outlets, saying "the desire to be 'first' has clouded the judgment of many reporters."

So here is what we know, and don't know, about the case:

What we know:

She's in a medically induced coma. Early last week, sources close to the family said she opened her eyes briefly and suffered seizures.

The extent of her injuries. We also don't know what prompted doctors to induce her coma, or what the reported seizures and eye-opening mean.

What we know:

Nick Gordon was one of the two people who reportedly found Bobbi Kristina Brown unresponsive in the tub. Brown called the 25-year-old her husband, but her father's attorney said the two were never married.

Gordon was taken in -- but not formally adopted -- by Houston when he was 12 years old.

A family friend says he's not welcome in Brown's hospital room.

What we don't know:

Why Brown called Gordon her husband when she didn't appear to be legally married.

In January 2014, she tweeted a picture of wedding rings, along with the words, "#HappilyMarriedâ€¢ SO#Inlove."

"GoodAmbreakfast for MYHusband," Brown also tweeted. "Surprise baby! Heh my man is the best :)(: so he deserves the best:) @nickdgordon."
