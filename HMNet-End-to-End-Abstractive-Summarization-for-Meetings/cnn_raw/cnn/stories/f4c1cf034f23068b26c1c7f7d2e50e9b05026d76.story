(CNN) -- Can you feel the change of seasons in the air?

It's almost time for apple cider, pumpkin picking and leaves changing color.

Autumn days are coming soon. Those shorter days tell trees that it's time to shut down for the winter. As trees stop photosynthesis -- the process by which plants use sunlight and water to make food -- fall colors will start to appear.

Why do leaves change colors?

We know this amazing scientific process happens every year, but we can't help but be mesmerized by its fleeting beauty.

To celebrate the season, CNN iReport chose some of our favorite autumn photos to share.
