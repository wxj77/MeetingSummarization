(CNN) -- Britain's Amir Khan has lost his International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Association (WBA) world light-welterweight titles after a controversial split points decision defeat to American Lamont Peterson in their showdown at the Washington Convention Center.

Khan was given the fight 115-110 on one of the judge's scorecards. However, the other two judges awarded local fighter Peterson the decision by scores of 113-112, enough for Khan to lose his belts.

The result proved contentious with referee Joe Cooper twice deducting Khan a point for pushing, in the seventh and 12th rounds, decisions that ultimately turned the fight in Peterson's favor.

A stunned Khan was clearly frustrated with the decision, saying in his post-fight interview: "It was like I was fighting two people in the ring, the referee and Lamont.

"I can see why there hasn't been a big fight in Washington in the last 20 years, because of decisions like this," added 25-year-old Khan -- who suffered only his second defeat from 28 professional bouts.

Meanwhile, Peterson, who improved to 30-1-1 after his win, said: "A lot of people thought I was the underdog but I followed my game plan the entire time and it worked.

"It was a long road but all the hard work paid off for me and it couldn't have been a better night."

Khan dominated the early stages of the fight, knocking down the challenger with a fierce right hand with just 28 seconds remaining of the opening round.

However, the fight began to harder to call as it progressed, and the moment when Khan was deducted a point for repeated pushing with his left forearm in round seven proved pivotal.

"Every time I tried to keep him away from me he kept coming in low," Khan continued. "I was the cleaner fighter. He was either going to head butt me or push me all night and the referee wasn't giving me a chance."
