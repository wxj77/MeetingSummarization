(EW.com) -- "Pitch Perfect" and "Mindy Project" co-star Anna Camp is headed to Vegas.

Camp has been cast in a multi-episode arc on the CBS period drama playing a sexy Hollywood starlet named Violet. The character is described as an aspiring actress who's the mistress of a film studio mogul. Violet's in Sin City for a film production that she hopes will be her big break. Dixon (Taylor Handley) agrees to work as her part-time bodyguard and the two become close.

Camp's own star is rising after appearing in the buzzy fall musical "Pitch Perfect." She's also pulling double duty on broadcast TV since she's a recurring character on Fox's "Mindy Project" this season. Previously, Camp has had arcs on CBS' "The Good Wife" and HBO's "True Blood." Vegas returns to original episodes next week.
