(CNN)  -- Hosts Argentina needed a stunning late strike from substitute Sergio Aguero to salvage a 1-1 draw against Bolivia in the Copa America opener Friday night.

Argentina could not break down the underdogs in the first half and just two minutes after the break it was Bolivia who took a shock lead as Edivaldo Rojas backheeled a corner past Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero.

Marcelo Martins might have put the game out of Argentina's reach as he beat the offside trap but Romero was alert to push the ball away from him before saving a follow-up effort.

A jittery Argentina, with Lionel Messi well below his best, had to wait until 13 minutes from time for the equalizer.

Nicolas Burdisso chested down a cross from Marcos Rojo and Atletico Madrid star Aguero volleyed home spectacularly.

Aguero had a late chance to give the hosts an undeserved win but Bolivia goalkeeper Carlos Arias saved smartly.

The opening match of the 12-team tournament was held in La Plata and a win for Argentina, with the likes of Messi and Carlos Tevez in their ranks, was considered almost a foregone conclusion by the home faithful.

But Bolivia played to the standard that had seen them humiliate Argentina 6-1 in the high altitude of La Paz during the last round of World Cup qualifying.

"It is not what we expected, now we must improve and win our remaining matches," Barcelona star Messi told gathered reporters after the draw.

Argentina's arch-rivals Brazil will be looking to win their fifth Copa America title in six and open against Venezuela on Sunday.

The 12 teams are divided into three groups of four, with the top two in each group and the two best third-placed teams reaching the quarterfinal knockout stage.
