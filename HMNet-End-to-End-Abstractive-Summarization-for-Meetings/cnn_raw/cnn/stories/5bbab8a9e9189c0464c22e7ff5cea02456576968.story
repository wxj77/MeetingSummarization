(CNN) -- Manchester City moved three points clear at the top of the English Premier League with a convincing 3-0 home win over sixth-placed Liverpool on Tuesday.

Goals from Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and a James Milner penalty put City ahead of second-placed local rivals Manchester United, who visit Newcastle on Wednesday.

Roberto Mancini's men survived the second-half dismissal of Gareth Barry in the 73rd minute, and even added to their tally as Martin Skrtel pulled down Toure and Milner converted from the spot.

It completed a miserable evening for Liverpool, who were missing striker Luis Suarez after club officials confirmed before the match they would not appeal his eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra.

City suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at Sunderland on Sunday, but went ahead after just 10 minutes as Argentina star Aguero beat Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina with a dipping shot he might have saved.

Liverpool pressed hard for an equalizer, but fell further behind on 33 minutes as the excellent Toure headed home David Silva's corner at the near post.

Reds manager Kenny Dalglish introduced Steven Gerrard and Craig Bellamy from the bench in the second half, but it was to no avail as City continued to control the match even when a man light.

City captain Vincent Kompany said his team had shown great character after the Sunderland defeat.

"It was massive for us, we didn't deserve to lose against Sunderland but we were incredibly efficient today," Kompany told Sky Sports.

In Tuesday's other games, third-placed Tottenham Hotspur beat West Bromwich Albion 1-0 while Sunderland continued to impress under new manager Martin O'Neill with a 4-1 win at struggling Wigan.

Tottenham moved to within three points of United after striker Jermain Defoe scored the only goal on 63 minutes at White Hart Lane.

Sunderland won for the fourth time in six games since O'Neill took charge, moving up to 10th in the table.
