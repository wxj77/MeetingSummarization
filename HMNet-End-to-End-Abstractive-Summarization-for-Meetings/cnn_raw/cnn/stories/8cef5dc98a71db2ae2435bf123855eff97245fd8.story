(CNN) -- Actress Sheila MacRae, who portrayed Alice Kramden in a 1960s revival of "The Honeymoooners," has died. She was 92.

MacRae played the iconic character on a Honeymooners segment that ran from 1966 to 1970 on "The Jackie Gleason Show."

She often referred to herself as "the last Mrs. Kramden," her daughter, Heather MacRae, told CNN.

MacRae also portrayed Miss Adelaide in "Guys and Dolls" on Broadway in 1965, in addition to TV roles in shows like "I Love Lucy," "General Hospital" and "Murder, She Wrote," according to the Internet Movie Database.

MacRae was born outside London and immigrated to the United States with her parents in 1939. She attended the American Academy of Arts in New York City.

She died Thursday at the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, New Jersey, where she had lived since 2009, Heather MacRae said.

Off stage and screen, famed New York restaurants Sardi's and 21 were her favorite places, and she also loved watching late night host David Letterman and New York Yankee Derek Jeter, her daughter said.

She is survived by two children, six grandchildren and two great grandchildren.

Her 26-year marriage to actor Gordon MacRae ended in divorce in 1967.
