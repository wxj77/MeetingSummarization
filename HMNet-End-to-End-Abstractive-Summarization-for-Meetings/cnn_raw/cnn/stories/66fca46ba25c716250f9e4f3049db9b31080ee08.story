(CNN) -- IN FOCUS: IRAQ'S CHILDREN LIVING IN GARBAGE DUMPS

As Iraq emerges as the world's fourth largest oil reserve in the world, the country's leaders are hoping their wealth can provide a decent living to its citizens, but for many living in Baghdad's Sadr City, the dream of a better life is far from becoming true. Men, women, children pushed by poverty, spend their days scouring the dumps looking for things to sell. From plastic bottles to aluminum cans, one man's trash has become another man's treasure. In Iraq it is a crucial lifeline for a number of families.
