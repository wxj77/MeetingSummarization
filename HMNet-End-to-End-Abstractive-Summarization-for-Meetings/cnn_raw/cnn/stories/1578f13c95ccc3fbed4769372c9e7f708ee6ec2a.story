(CNN) -- The TV show of embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford was canceled Tuesday, just one day after it debuted.

He and his brother hosted "Ford Nation" on Canada's Sun News Network.

"It beat our record of 100,000 viewers," but the time and production the show required does not make it a viable option, said Kory Teneycke, vice president of Sun News Network.

The Ford brothers will appear as regular guests on Sun News programming, he said.

The show debuted Monday, the same day the Toronto City Council voted to strip the mayor of most of his powers in a tumultuous meeting during which a charging Ford knocked down one of its members.

Roughly two weeks after Ford admitted to smoking crack cocaine in a "drunken stupor" -- an admission forced by a drug investigation that resulted in extortion charges against a friend -- the mayor said he was done apologizing. He called Monday's vote "a coup d'etat" and compared it to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, warning council members, "What goes around, comes around, friends."

Undeterred, the council voted 36-5 to slash the budget of the mayor's office and transfer most of his duties to the deputy mayor. City Councilor Karen Stintz said Ford "doesn't understand the issues he's facing," and Monday's votes reduce him to "a figurehead."

Ford says he didn't lie about crack use

The council already has called on Ford to take a leave of absence and voted to strip him of his emergency powers. In Monday's session, Ford and his brother, City Councilor Doug Ford, sparred with hecklers in the council gallery who chanted "Shame, shame, shame" during a recess.

During that break, Rob Ford stomped over to his brother, knocking down Councilor Pam McConnell in the process, an apparently accidental act for which the mayor had to issue another apology.
