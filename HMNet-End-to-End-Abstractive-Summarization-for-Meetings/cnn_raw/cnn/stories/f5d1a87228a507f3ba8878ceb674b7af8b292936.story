(CNN) -- Glee star and semi-professional dreamboat Darren Criss has some "very, very exciting news" to announce: "I'm happy to officially announce my very first solo tour throughout North America. It's Canada, the United States — 16 dates, all over the place. Hopefully we're coming by to a city near you," he said in a video today.

More deets: Criss will be playing both old and new material (like a set-list!), be having a lot of fun, and — yes — he has been working on a solo album whilst also acting in TV shows and online musicals.

"But I still have these songs, and I really want to share them with people before we put them out into the world," Criss said. So the tour will be called "Listen up...," kicking off on May 29 in Criss' hometown, San Francisco before moving on to dates in L.A., Houston, Chicago, Nashville, and New York, among others.
