(EW.com) -- This "Super Fun Night" casting is, frankly, super fun.

EW has learned exclusively that "Saturday Night Live" alum Fred Armisen has signed up to guest star in an upcoming episode of Rebel Wilson sitcom Super Fun Night. The "Portlandia" star will reportedly play a character named Brian Headfoot, the exasperated head of HR at the law firm where Wilson's Kimmie works. In the episode, his character is called in to broker a truce between feuding Kimmie and Kendall (Kate Jenkinson).

The episode is set to air early 2014 on ABC.

Armisen is not the first "SNL" alum to guest on the Wednesday night comedy. Just this week, Molly Shannon appeared on the show as a relationship guru nicknamed "The Love Lioness."
