(CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton designated an India-based militant group as a foreign terrorist organization Thursday.

It is the Indian Mujahideen, which has "close ties to other U.S.- designated terrorist entities." They include Pakistan-based Lashkar e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Harakat ul-Jihad-i-Islami.

The State Department said in a statement the group's goal "is to carry out terrorist actions against non-Muslims in furtherance of its ultimate objective -- an Islamic Caliphate across South Asia. "

In 2008, the group "was responsible for 16 synchronized bomb blasts in crowded urban centers and a local hospital that killed 38 and injured more than 100 in Ahmedabad," the State Department said. It "played a facilitative role" in the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 163 people. It also carried out the 2010 bombing of a bakery in Pune, India, killing 17 people.

U.S. entities and people are prohibited from "providing material support or resources to, or engaging in other transactions" with the group. Another result of the designation is the "freezing of all property and interests in property of the organization that are in the United States, or come within the United States, or the control of U.S. persons."
