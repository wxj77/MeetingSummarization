Monday's show is global in scope; it includes reports on Easter celebrations around the world, strikes on suspected terrorists in Yemen, and an avalanche on the world's tallest mountain. We also explore what it's like to preserve part of Boston's history, and we show you how a college student is making every penny count toward tuition.
