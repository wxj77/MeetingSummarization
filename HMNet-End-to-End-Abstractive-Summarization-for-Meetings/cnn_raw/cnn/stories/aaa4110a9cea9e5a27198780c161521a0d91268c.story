(CNN) -- A man suspected of firing an assault rifle in a shootout with authorities, which happened shortly after he tried to force his way onto a Missouri military base, was arrested Thursday on a college campus, police said.

Cody Wilcoxson was armed with an AK-47 gun when he was detained at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, said Rolla Police Chief Mark Kearse. Police were able to take him into custody without any shots being fired on campus, he said.

That wasn't the case earlier, according to Kearse. He said Wilcoxson tried to get onto Fort Leonard Wood, a U.S. Army base more than 25 miles west of Rolla.

The man did not manage to enter the military base. But afterward, the police chief said, he fired dozens of rounds of bullets from his assault rifle in a shootout with police.

He then likely headed east down Route 44 to the university, Kearse said.

Despite the exchange of gunfire, there no reports of injuries.
