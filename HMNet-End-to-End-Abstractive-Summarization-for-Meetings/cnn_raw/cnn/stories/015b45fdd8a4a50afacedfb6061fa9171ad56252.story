(CNN) -- Alleged Boston crime boss James "Whitey" Bulger may have authored two memoirs, one of which was titled "My Life in the Irish Mafia," according to court documents.

It is not clear whether the notorious fugitive, who evaded authorities for 16 years, actually wrote the memoir, but prosecutors say it is part of their investigation.

The manuscript was seized at a South Boston home on January 5, 1995, the same day a warrant was issued for Bulger's arrest on racketeering charges.

The alleged gangster also apparently penned a separate autobiography that was found by authorities at Bulger's Santa Monica, California, apartment after his arrest there, courts documents say.

Bulger, 82, has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him, including 19 murder counts.

Once one of the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives, he is currently being held without bail and faces an impending racketeering indictment after authorities tracked him down in June 2011 at his California home.

Bulger was arrested after being lured out of his apartment with an FBI ruse: He apparently received a phone call and was told his lock box, located in the basement parking lot of his building, had been broken into. When Bulger went down to check, FBI agents arrested him.

His alleged barbarity as an Irish-American mobster in Boston inspired the Jack Nicholson character in Martin Scorsese's 2006 film "The Departed."
