Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A man causing a disturbance outside a movie theater near Universal Studios died Friday after being handcuffed and shocked with a Taser stun gun, Orlando police said.

Two off-duty officers who were working security in the area tried to deal with a man who was acting "irrational," early Friday morning, said Sgt. Barb Jones, an Orlando police spokeswoman.

The suspect -- identified as Adam Spencer Johnson, 33, of Winter Haven, Florida -- began to "violently" resist after one of the officers tried to detain him, Jones said. An officer shocked the man with a Taser stun gun, then he was handcuffed, police said.

While on the ground, Johnson became unresponsive. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.

The officers involved were placed on routine administrative leave pending an investigation of the deaths, according to police.

CNN's Samuel Gardner III contributed to this report.
