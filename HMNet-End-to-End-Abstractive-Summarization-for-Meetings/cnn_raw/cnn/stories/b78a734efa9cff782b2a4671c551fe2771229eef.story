(CNN) -- Spain's Marc Marquez became the youngest rider to ever win the MotoGP world championship on Sunday after finishing third at the final race of the season in Valencia.

The 20-year-old rookie only needed to finish fourth to ensure that the 13-point lead he took into the race could not be overhauled and he duly delivered.

Two-time world champion, Jorge Lorenzo did all he could to put the pressure on his young rival taking the chequered flag to claim his eighth win of the season with Dani Pedrosa finishing second. But it was Marquez who stole all the headlines.

At 20 years and 266 days old, the Honda rider beats the previous record set by American Freddie Spencer who won the 500cc title in 1983 when he was 21 years, 258 days old.

"I cannot explain what I feel, (it is) a dream come true," Marquez said.

"Maybe I was clear too early (in the season) and then Jorge came charging at the end and I had to keep my nerve in the final race. I am overjoyed," he added.

Lorenzo finally ran out of track in his attempt to reign in the lead Marquez built in the first half of the season. Five wins in the final seven races made for a thrilling climax with Lorenzo finishing just four points adrift of his compatriot.

In a season where records tumbled, the young Catalan announced his arrival with a fastest lap in qualifying and a podium finish in the opening race in Qatar.

At the next race he claimed his maiden MotoGP win at the Grand Prix of the Americas to become the youngest ever winner of a premier class GP.

Five more wins followed but it was Marquez's incredible consistency that proved the difference with podium placings in every race he finished (16 out of 18).

Marquez also becomes the first rookie to win motorcycling's premier racing class since America's Kenny Roberts achieved the feat in 1978.
