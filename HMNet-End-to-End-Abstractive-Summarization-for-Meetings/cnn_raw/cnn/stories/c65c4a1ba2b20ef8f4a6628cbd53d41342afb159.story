(CNN)  -- Former Italian international star Filippo Inzaghi scored a hat-trick as AC Milan went second in Serie A with a 5-1 win over Torino in the San Siro on Sunday.

Beckham and Mathieu Flamini take part in an unusual goal celebration in the San Siro.

The legendary goalscorer has now put away nine in the last six matches but it was his combination with England international David Beckham which electrified the Milan fans.

Beckham, who had sat out the last two games because of a shoulder injury, set up Inzaghi for his opening two goals in the 13th and 37th minutes from a corner and a clever chip, both headed home.

After the interval, Inzaghi completed his hat-trick on the hour mark before Kaka added a penalty for the fourth.

Ivan Franceschini pulled one back for Torino in the 80th minute, but Massimo Ambrosini rounded off the Milan scoring in the final minute.

The win sees Milan level on points with Juventus but with a better goal difference. They trail leaders Inter by 10 points.

In the battle for the fourth and final Champions League qualifying spot, AS Roma beat Lecce 3-2 with captain Francesco Totti scoring twice.

Fifth-placed Fiorentina hardly helped their cause with a 3-1 defeat to Udinese, missing the chance to move a place higher after Genoa lost 1-0 at home to Lazio on Saturday.

Improving Roma are now three points behind Fiorentina and five adrift of fourth-placed Genoa.

Kwadwo Asamoah put Udinese ahead in the 10th minute lead and Gaetano D'Agostino doubled the lead from the penalty spot early in the second half.

Dario Dainelli pulled one back for La Viola after 67 minutes but D'Agostino's second sealed three points.
