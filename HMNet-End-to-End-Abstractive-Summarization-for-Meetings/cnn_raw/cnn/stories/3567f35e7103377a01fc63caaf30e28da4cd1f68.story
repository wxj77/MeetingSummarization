Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Lee Thompson Young committed suicide in his Los Angeles apartment Monday morning, his manager said.

"It is with great sadness that I announce that Lee Thompson Young tragically took his own life this morning," Jonathan Baruch said.

Young, 29, is best known for the leading role on Disney's "The Famous Jett Jackson" television series starting in 1998.

More recently he has been acting in TNT's "Rizzoli & Isles" as Detective Barry Frost.

"Lee was more than just a brilliant young actor, he was a wonderful and gentle soul who will be truly missed," Baruch said. "We ask that you please respect the privacy of his family and friends as this very difficult time."

Young's body was found in his home at 8 a.m. Monday, a Los Angeles police spokesman said.

"Rizzoli & Isles" Executive Producer Janet Tamaro said the cast and crew were "devastated by the news."

"We are beyond heartbroken at the loss of this sweet, gentle, good-hearted, intelligent man," Tamaro said. "He was truly a member of our family. Lee will be cherished and remembered by all who knew and loved him, both on- and offscreen, for his positive energy, infectious smile and soulful grace. We send our deepest condolences and thoughts to his family, to his friends and, most especially, to his beloved mother."

Young, who was born in Canada, also co-starred on UPN's "South Beach" and had recurring roles on "FlashForward," "Scrubs" and "Smallville," Baruch said. His feature credits include "Friday Night Lights," "Akeelah and the Bee" and "The Hills Have Eyes II."
