(CNN) -- Dutch midfielder Mark van Bommel joined Serie A leaders AC Milan on Tuesday after Bayern Munich agreed to release the 33-year-old from his contract.

The former Barcelona player's contract at the German champions was due to expire in June, but Bayern have allowed their captain to make the switch to Milan with immediate effect.

"Mark formally requested to be released from his contract before its expiry date for professional and career reasons," club chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Bayern's website.

"Mark has always been a model professional, an important and successful player for Bayern and an outstanding club captain. On the basis of his service to the club, we have granted Mark's request."

Van Bommel, who has signed a contract with Milan until the end of June, will head to the San Siro with the Rossoneri four-points clear at the top of Italy's Serie A after Sunday's 2-0 win over Cesena.

"I leave FC Bayern with a heavy heart," Van Bommel said. "I've had four and a half wonderful and successful years here, and I'd expressly like to thank the club and the fans for that. FC Bayern will always occupy a big place in my heart."

Former Netherlands captain Van Bommel made 122 Bundesliga appearances for Bayern and also led his country to the 2010 FIFA World Cup final, where they lost 1-0 to Spain.

Another Dutchman set for a transfer is Liverpool forward Ryan Babel, who has completed a move to Hoffenheim in Germany.

The English Premier League club confirmed the news on their website. Hoffenheim, currently eighth in Germany's top flight, had an offer accepted for the 24-year-old six days ago.

Babel, who has 38 caps for the Netherlands, joined Liverpool from Dutch outfit Ajax in 2007.
