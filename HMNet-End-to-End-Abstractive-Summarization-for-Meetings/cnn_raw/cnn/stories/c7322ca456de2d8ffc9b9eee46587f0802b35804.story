Emmy-winning actress Polly Bergen, whose TV and movie career spanned more than six decades, has died, her publicist said.

Bergen -- who was 84, according to her profile on IMDb.com -- died peacefully at her home in Southbury, Connecticut, on Saturday morning, publicist Judy Katz said in a statement. She was surrounded by her family, longtime manager and friends.

The Tennessee native first appeared on screen in the 1949 Western "Across the Rio Grande." She had notable roles in the films "Cape Fear" in 1962 and "The Caretakers" the following year.

She won an Emmy Award in 1958 for work in the CBS anthology series "Playhouse 90."

She was nominated three more times, including for roles in two miniseries: "Winds of War" in 1983 and "War and Remembrance" in 1988-1989, both on ABC.

Bergen was nominated in 2008 for outstanding guest actress in "Desperate Housewives," playing the mother of Felicity Huffman's character, Lynette.
