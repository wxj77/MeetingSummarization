(CNN)  -- Cesc Fabregas' return to Barcelona could be delayed by a further season after the president of the Catalan giants Sandro Rosell said they will not "go mad" in their attempt to sign the Spanish international midfielder.

Fabregas had been expected to leave Arsenal during the close season transfer window, but the Premier League club have placed a big price tag on their star asset and are refusing to budge.

Rosell told Catalan TV3 that Arsenal "don't want to listen to offers to sell and they are not putting the player on the market."

Arsenal have reportedly turned back one £30 million ($45.89m) offer for Fabregas from the Spanish champions, who have been forced to take out a €155 million ($200.58m) loan to ease their financial problems.

And Rosell said they would not break the bank to land the 23-year-old, particularly as he believes there is ill-feeling between his club and Arsene Wenger's Arsenal.

"There was a strong dispute a few months ago and they have not forgotten it. Nor will we be going mad trying to sign him," he added.

Barcelona's Spanish World Cup teammates of Fabregas embarrassingly forced him to wear their shirt as they celebrated their triumph, but it remains to be seen if a deal can still be thrashed out.

Barcelona have already completed the big-money purchase of Spain World Cup hero David Villa from Valencia this summer and on Friday sealed the signing of Brazilian utility player Adriano from Sevilla.

The 25-year-old, who can play at full-back or as a wide midfielder, will cost an initial fee of €9.5 million ($12.29m) with an additional fee payable depending on appearances and performances.

Adriano, who has been at Sevilla since 2004, will complete a medical at the Camp Nou on Saturday.
