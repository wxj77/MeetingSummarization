(CNN) -- A semi collided with an Amtrak train east of Reno, Nevada, on Friday, killing two people, officials said.

The truck crashed into the side of the train at a public railroad crossing, according to Amtrak.

Nevada Highway Patrol Trooper Danny Lopez said two people died in the accident: one person on the train and one in the semitrailer.

Amtrak said it had reports of multiple injuries but could not immediately confirm that anyone had been killed.

Amateur video taken after the crash showed huge plumes of black smoke wafting from the train as a fire burned. Passengers and crew members stood outside.

Emergency responders were on the scene, and buses were being sent to pick up stranded passengers, Lopez said.

The train carried about 204 passengers and 14 crew members. It was headed to Emeryville, California, from Chicago.
