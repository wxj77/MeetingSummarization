(CNN) -- The pictures might be NSFW -- at least if you're looking at them over lunch -- but Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson was certainly working it on Sunday.

Donning red lipstick, a flight attendant's skirt and high heels, the maverick businessman served drinks, made intercom announcements and chatted up passengers on an AirAsia X flight from Perth, Australia, to Kuala Lumpur.

A little recap.

Two years ago, Branson and AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes wagered on their Formula 1 racing teams, each man betting his own team would finish ahead of the other's in the 2010 Formula 1 Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi.

The loser would have to serve as a female flight attendant on the winner's airline.

Branson lost.

On Sunday, he honored the bet by serving on a special AirAsia X charity flight.

Branson wore heavy makeup, including fake eyelashes and bright red lipstick. At a cocktail event in Perth the night before the flight, he had his legs shaved, but managed to keep his mustache.

"This has been a real first for me but I have enjoyed the experience and I have nothing but respect for what our fabulous flight attendants do every day to keep us safe," said Branson after the flight.

"He is an entrepreneur, visionary, knight and adventurer, Sir Richard can now also add AirAsia flight attendant to his long list of credentials," joked Fernandes.

During the five-and-a-half-hour flight, Branson poured coffee and tea, served meals, distributed merchandise, made in-flight announcements and entertained the passengers, according to an AirAsia statement.

He also accidentally (read: deliberately) tipped a tray of drinks over Fernandes during the flight. The two are close friends.

For each seat sold for the event, AirAsia X is donating A$100 ($100) to Starlight Children's Foundation, an Australia-based organization dedicated to seriously ill and hospitalized children and their families.

The event raised approximately $200,000 for the charity.
