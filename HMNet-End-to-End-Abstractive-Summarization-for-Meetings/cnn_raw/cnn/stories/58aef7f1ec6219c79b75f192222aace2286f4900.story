(CNN) -- Singer Gavin DeGraw canceled his next two shows while he recovers from an attack in New York that left him with a concussion, broken nose, black eyes and cuts and bruises, his representative said Tuesday.

DeGraw checked out of New York's Bellevue Hospital Tuesday, his rep said.  He was taken late Sunday night by ambulance after he was "attacked by a group of assailants," said the representative, Fran Curtis.

DeGraw sent his fans a message via Twitter Tuesday:

"Hi my friends. Honestly, I don't remember much. I only know I can recover from here. Thank u all for your genuine concern. I love u guys."

DeGraw's show in Wantagh, New York, scheduled for Friday, and in Mansfield, Massachusetts, scheduled for Saturday, have been canceled because of his injuries, the rep said.

No arrests have been made, but New York police are investigating.

"Gavin and his family appreciate everyone's concern at this time," Curtis said.

CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.
