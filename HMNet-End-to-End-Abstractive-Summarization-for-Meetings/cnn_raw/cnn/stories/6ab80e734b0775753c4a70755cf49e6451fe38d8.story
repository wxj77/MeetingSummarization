CNN Presents: The Women Who Would Be Queen

A prince looking for love. A commoner destined to be queen. One family hoping to get it right this time around. All haunted by memories of a fairytale turned tragedy. A young girl thrust into the international spotlight, her world under a microscope, her life in danger.

Will this time be different?

Anchor and special correspondent Soledad O'Brien looks at the life of Catherine Middleton, the woman who will someday become Queen of the United Kingdom. Featured in the documentary are Jules Knight, close friend of the couple from the origins of their fairytale romance during their university days at St. Andrews, and Arthur Edwards, longtime royal photographer, who has chronicled the princes' entire lives during his 30-year career at England's The Sun newspaper. Edwards has captured the princes' childhoods, how they've coped with the tragic loss of their mother, and their transition into manhood. The documentary also explores the ways in which the future King and Queen have honored the life and legacy of Diana, Princess of Wales.
