(CNN)Everyone's favorite male models made a surprise appearance at Tuesday's Valentino show at Paris Fashion Week.

And, no surprise, they were really, really ridiculously good-looking.

Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson reprised their roles as the vacuous models from the popular 2001 film "Zoolander" at Tuesday's women's couture show.

There was no mistaking Stiller for anyone other than the fierce Zoolander as he sashayed down the runway in a Valentino trench, casting Blue Steel in every direction.

He was followed by nemesis Hansel McDonald, played by Wilson, showing off another Valentino coat over a pair of "lovely" pajamas, Wall Street Journalist fashion columnist Christina Binkley said.

The duo is gearing up for "Zoolander 2," which is slated for release in February 2016.

"Apparently Derek and Hansel have come to terms on #Zoolander2," Ben Stiller joked in a selfie posted on his Instagram account.

Publicity stunt, perhaps, but we're not complaining about an opportunity to bring back the phrase, "he's so hot right now."
