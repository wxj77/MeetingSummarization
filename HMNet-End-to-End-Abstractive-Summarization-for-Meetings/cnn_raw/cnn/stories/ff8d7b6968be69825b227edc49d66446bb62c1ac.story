MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- Searchers looking for a woman believed to have fallen from a cruise ship off the Yucatan coast of Mexico have seen no sign of her, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said Friday afternoon.

The Norwegian Pearl is on a seven-day Caribbean cruise.

Lt. Matt Moorlag, based in Miami, said crews would work into the night to find 33-year-old Jennifer Feitz, whose husband reported her missing aboard the Norwegian Pearl about 3:40 a.m. Friday.

Ship personnel called the Coast Guard for help when they couldn't locate Feitz.

Moorlag said he had not spoken with the woman's husband.

The search was centered about 15 miles east of Cancun, Mexico, in the Caribbean Sea, said Petty Officer 3rd Class Nick Ameen, a Coast Guard spokesman.

"Initial reports indicate the guest may have gone overboard while the ship was at sea, east of Cancun," a spokeswoman for the Miami-based Norwegian Cruise Line said in a statement.

AnneMarie Mathews said the ship left Miami on Sunday on a seven-day western Caribbean cruise.

The Coast Guard dispatched an Air Station Miami HU-25 Falcon jet crew, and a C-130 fixed-wing aircraft crew from the Air Station in Clearwater, Florida, also was headed to the site, Ameen said.

The Mexican government was aiding the search with a helicopter crew and three water- and ground-surface crews.
