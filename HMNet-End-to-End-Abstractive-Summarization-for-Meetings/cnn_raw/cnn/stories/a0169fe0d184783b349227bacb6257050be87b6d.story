(CNN) -- Dry ice in a plastic bottle exploded in an employee restroom at Los Angeles International Airport, causing a brief shutdown of one terminal, the FBI said.

The restroom is an area of Terminal 2 not open to the general public, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said in a statement.

The FBI and other agencies "will investigate the incident to determine the individual or group responsible," Eimiller said.

No injuries were reported, and Terminal 2 resumed operations after a brief evacuation.

Terminal 2 is the airport's "secondary international terminal," airport spokesman Nancy Castle said.
