Los Angeles (CNN) -- Basketball star and Kardashian spouse Lamar Odom settled his drunken driving charge with a no contest plea Monday.

Odom, 33, must serve 36 months' probation, attend three months of alcohol counseling and pay a total of $1,814 in fines and fees for the DUI charge, according to Los Angeles City Attorney spokesman Rob Wilcox.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles will hold a hearing later to decide how long Odom's driver's license will be suspended. It was automatically suspended when he was arrested.

Odom, who is married to reality TV star Khloe Kardashian, changed his not guilty plea, entered before a Los Angeles County judge two months ago to a no contest plea, Wilcox said.

He was arrested on a driving under the influence charge in the early morning hours of August 30 by a California Highway Patrol officer who reported seeing Odom, 34, driving his white Mercedes SUV in a "serpentine manner at 50 mph."

Odom "showed objective signs of intoxication and he was unable to perform his field sobriety tests," a CHP news release said.

In 2001, Odom admitted to having violated NBA drug policies twice.

"I've made a couple (of mistakes) and I may make a couple again, but hopefully they won't be as big as this one," Odom told reporters then.

Odom is a free agent who has played in the NBA for 14 years, including for the Los Angeles Lakers, the Dallas Mavericks and, most recently, the Los Angeles Clippers.
