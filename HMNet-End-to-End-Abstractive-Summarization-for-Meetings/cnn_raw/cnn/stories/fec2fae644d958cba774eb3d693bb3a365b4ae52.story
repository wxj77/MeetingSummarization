New York (CNN) -- One wily coyote traveled a bit too far from home, and its resulting adventure through Harlem had alarmed residents doing a double take and scampering to get out of its way Wednesday morning.

Police say frightened New Yorkers reported the coyote sighting around 9:30 a.m., and an emergency service unit was dispatched to find the animal. The little troublemaker was caught and tranquilized in Trinity Cemetery on 155th street and Broadway, and then taken to the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo, authorities said.

"The coyote is under evaluation and observation," said Mary Dixon, spokesperson for the Wildlife Conservation Society.

Dixon said the coyote is a female, between 1 and 2 years old. She said the Department of Environmental Conservation will either send the animal to a rescue center or put it back in the wild.

According to Adrian Benepe, New York City Parks Commissioner, coyotes in Manhattan are rare, but not unheard of.

"This is actually the third coyote that has been seen in the last 10 years," Benepe said.

Benepe said there is a theory the coyotes make their way to the city from suburban Westchester.

He said they probably walk down the Amtrak rail corridor along the Hudson River or swim down the Hudson River until they get to the city.
