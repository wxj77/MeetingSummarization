This news will bring a smile to the face of many Jared Leto fans.

The Oscar-winning actor has been cast to play the Joker in "Suicide Squad," based on the DC Comics series, due in theaters on August 5, 2016.

Warner Bros. Pictures (owned by Time Warner, just like CNN) confirmed the long-rumored casting on Tuesday.

Not to be outdone, Leto will be joined in the cast by Will Smith, who will portray the antihero Deadshot, while Margot Robbie is playing the Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn, a fan favorite.

Tom Hardy -- best known as Bane from "The Dark Knight Rises" -- returns to the world of comic book movies as Rick Flagg.

Rounding out the cast are Jai Courtney as Boomerang and Cara Delevingne as Enchantress.

David Ayer -- writer of "The Fast and the Furious" and "Training Day" -- will write "Suicide Squad" and take the director's chair, as previously announced.

"We look forward to seeing this terrific ensemble, under Ayer's amazing guidance, give new meaning to what it means to be a villain and what it means to be a hero," said Greg Silverman, president of Creative Development and Worldwide Production for Warner Bros.

With Leto sure to relish the role of the Clown Prince of Crime, and Smith stepping out of the role of hero, this will be an interesting one to watch.
