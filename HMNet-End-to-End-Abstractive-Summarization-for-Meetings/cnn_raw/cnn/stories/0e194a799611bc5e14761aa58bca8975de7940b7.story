(EW.com) -- HBO will bow the fourth and final season of "Eastbound and Down" on Sept. 29.

Production on the eight-episode season will start Friday in North Carolina. The single-camera comedy stars Kenny Powers as a former major league pitcher.

The third season concluded in April 2012 and was thought to be its last, though HBO convinced star Danny McBride and executive producers Jody Hill, Will Ferrell, Chris Henchy and Adam McKay to create more episodes of the cult hit.

The upcoming fourth season picks up the action several years later and finds Kenny living the American Dream with his family in North Carolina.
