Producer's note: When Daniel Furbish started a bike workshop at a community center in Nashville, he didn't know that much about building or fixing bikes. 

He did, however, know what an important tool a bike can be for a kid with little or no other means of transportation. 

We met him to see how this little experiment turned into a full-time program that has helped hundreds.
