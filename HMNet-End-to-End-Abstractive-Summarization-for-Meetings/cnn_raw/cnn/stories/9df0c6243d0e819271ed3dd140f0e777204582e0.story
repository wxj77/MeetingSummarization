(CNN) -- A University of Oklahoma professor has been suspended amid allegations of sexual abuse, school police said Tuesday.

"OU officials acted swiftly to suspend (Dwain Pellebon) from any contact with students and from use of any university facilities," said Catherine Bishop of the university police department.

"In accordance with university procedure, he was immediately placed on administrative leave with pay until more of the facts of the investigation are known at which time it could be changed to without pay."

The 54-year-old associate professor teaches social work. Norman police arrested him Friday on two complaints of rape in the first degree and one complaint of lewd acts with a child under age 16, CNN affiliate KFOR reported.

Official charges have not been filed.

"We can say there is one alleged victim, and we are working to determine if there are any additional victims," Tom Easley with the Norman Police Department said, according to KFOR.

An attorney for Pellebon told KFOR that his client denies all the allegations against him.

The university's web page says Pellebon teaches a course on human sexuality, described as "an examination of sexual behavior, gender differences and sexual values."

CNN's Joe Sutton and Ed Payne contributed to this report.
