"When a tragedy reaches someone with the age of Robert Enke the frustration is still bigger."

Enke's former team-mate Nuno Gomes added: "I remember how he was just a young kid when he came here but, from day one, he made a great effort to learn our language and did it very quickly.

"He was a young kid with a huge desire to reach his goals and learn, a man with a capital M."
