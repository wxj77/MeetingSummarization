(CNN) -- New grandmother Hillary Clinton was presented with a slew of gifts, mostly books, for her baby granddaughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, Monday afternoon at a private New York City fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

DCCC chairman Steve Israel told CNN he gave Clinton a series of books that fell into several categories:

Classics: "Goodnight Moon" and "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,"

Topical: "Veterans, Heroes in our Neighborhood," "America the Beautiful," "Global Babies" (pictures of babies around the world, in honor of Secretary of State Clinton), and a New York pop-up book,

Political: "Baby Bear Sees Blue," "Blue Bus Red Balloon" (in a show of bipartisanship),

Career: A children's illustrated version of Machiavelli's "The Prince,"

And lastly Israel, a New York congressman who represents parts of Long Island and Queens, gave Clinton a New York Mets uniform for her granddaughter for "when she is ready to play third base."
