(CNN) -- German goalkeeper Nadine Angerer achieved the rare feat of saving two penalties in a major football final to help her side beat Norway 1-0 Sunday to win Euro 2013.

Angerer kept out spot kicks in either half with substitute Anja Mittag scoring the only goal of the match in Solna in Sweden just after the break.

It was enough to give Germany an unprecedented sixth straight European Championship crown, with the last two under legendary former player and now head coach Silvia Neid.

An uneventful first half came to life when Norway were awarded the first of their penalties as Catherine Dekkerhus hit the turf under challenge from Celia Okoyino da Mbabi.

Penalty save

Angerer, incensed by the earlier award of a corner to Norway just before the penalty incident, channeled her aggression to keep out Trine Ronning's penalty with her knee.

Germany took the lead just after the halftime break with Mittag tapping in from close range after excellent work by Okoyino da Mbabi.

Norway responded with a surging run from Caroline Hansen brought to an abrupt end to lead to the award of a second penalty.

This time Solveig Gulbrandsen stepped up to attempt to score, but her effort was too close to Angerer, who fended it away.

Germany enjoyed more good fortune when Maren Mjelde's cross was turned in by Ada Hegerberg, but she was rightly flagged for offside.

Deserved winners

But the reigning champions were deserved winners, with Nadine Kessler's late low shot and an earlier header from Leonie Maier both hitting the woodwork.

Still looking for their first Olympic gold medal, Germany have dominated at European level, winning eight of the 11 championships staged, with Neid being involved in them all.

The result also continued two-time winner Norway's losing run in Euro finals to Germany, this there fourth and doubly frustrating thanks to Angerer's heroics.

Norway had also beaten Germany in the group stages of the competition, but could not repeat the feat when it really mattered.
