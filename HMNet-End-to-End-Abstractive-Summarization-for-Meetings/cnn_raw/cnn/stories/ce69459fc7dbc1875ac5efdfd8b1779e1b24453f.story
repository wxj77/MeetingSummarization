New York (CNN) -- A New York police detective was among four bikers who pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges in connection with the beating -- caught on video -- of an SUV driver in September.

Wojceich Braszczok is charged with gang assault, criminal mischief, riot and more in the 14-count indictment related to the September 29 altercation with SUV driver Alexander Lien.

Braszczok was off duty at the time.

Footage of the incident recorded from another biker's helmet camera went viral after it was posted online.

Authorities say Lien was chased by bikers after he initially bumped one during a biker rally. When his Range Rover was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 911, told police he feared for his life and drove off, running over bikers and critically injuring one.

Lien's wife and 2-year-old daughter were in the vehicle with him.

The chase that followed ended in traffic. Police say Lien's windows were smashed, he was dragged out of the SUV and beaten. He was treated and released from a hospital. He has not been charged.

Prosecutors say Braszczok is on video allegedly using his fist to bash in the rear window of Lien's SUV and kick it. His attorney, John Arlia, declined to comment on the case Wednesday.

Also entering not guilty pleas Wednesday:

--Clint Caldwell, charged with felony first-degree gang assault. Prosecutors have said Caldwell opened the door to Lien's SUV and appeared to assault him.

--James Kuehne, a 31-year-old Brooklyn resident, who faces charges of gang assault, criminal mischief and criminal possession of a weapon.

--Kaliq Douglas, charged with felony gang assault.
