(CNN) -- Who doesn't love a good holiday-themed episode?

Before our favorite TV characters put their turkeys in the oven, decorate their Christmas trees and light their menorahs, they'll dress up in funny costumes and beg for candy ... or mercy.

Kicking off prime time's Halloween celebration is ABC Family's "Pretty Little Liars," which will air its second annual Halloween special on Tuesday at 8 p.m.

We can't wait to see how "A" will terrorize Aria, Hanna, Emily and Spencer aboard Rosewood's Halloween Ghost Train.

On a lighter note, "The Mindy Project" will air its Halloween episode, complete with hilarious costumes and an equally hilarious guest star, Bill Hader, at 9:30 p.m.

Mindy Kaling, the creator and star of the Fox sitcom, said her character will have "five or six costume changes" throughout the episode, and "they're not sexy, hot girl costumes."

Here are some other special Halloween episodes to look for:
