ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Police used pepper gas and water cannons to disperse crowds of demonstrators who took to the streets Tuesday to protest a meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Some protesters broke shop windows in and around Taksim Square before scurrying for cover as police armored cars hosed them with water.

Taksim Square, in downtown Istanbul, is blocks from the site of the IMF meeting.

Delegates are in the city to discuss ways to battle poverty and to strategize ways to prevent a repeat of last year's global economic crisis.

On Thursday, a protester threw a shoe at the IMF director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, at the end of a question-and-answer session Thursday at a university in Istanbul. The shoe missed.

Other demonstrators at Bilgi University unfurled a banner and chanted, "Go away, IMF. You're stealing money."
