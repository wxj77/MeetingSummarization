(CNN)  -- World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki came through her opener against Nadia Petrova at the WTA Qatar Open after a string of seeded players crashed out Wednesday.

Wozniacki, fresh from her triumph in Dubai, had little trouble against 2006 champion Petrova, running out a 6-3 6-2 winner in their second round match.

"It's great to start off with a win and continue with my good form after Dubai," the Dane told the official WTA website.

She secured a single break in the opener to move ahead and three breaks of service in the second.

Her victory sets up a quarterfinal clash against Italian Flavia Pennetta at the Khalifa Tennis and Squash Complex.

Penetta's compatriot and third seed Francesca Schiavone became the biggest casualty yet as she was beaten 7-5 6-3 by China's Peng Shuai.

Schiavone, the reigning French Open champion, complained of tiredness after her defeat.

Fourth-seeded Li Na, the Australian Open finalist, crashed to a 6-2 6-1 loss to Czech Klara Zakopalova, while eighth seed Shahar Peer of Israel was thrashed 6-1 6-0 by France's Marion Bartoli.

"She gave me no chance," said Peer, who had beaten two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the first round.

"I have won seven out of nine times against her in the past, but today she was simply too good."

Second seed and World No.3 Vera Zvonareva also avoided an upset as she swept aside Dominika Cibulkova 6-1 6-2 in the final match of the day.

Russian Zvonareva showed no signs of a recent niggling shoulder injury to stay on course for a final clash with Wozniacki.
