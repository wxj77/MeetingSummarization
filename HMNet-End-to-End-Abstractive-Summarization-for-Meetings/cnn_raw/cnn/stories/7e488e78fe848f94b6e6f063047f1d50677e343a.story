(CNN) -- With just a few weeks left in 2013, the American Film Institute has unveiled its list of the best movies and TV shows of the year.

The honorees are largely unsurprising, with Netflix once again getting a clap on the back for its original programming and awards season front-runners like "Her" and "Gravity" receiving more recognition.

The AFI Awards, now on its 14th edition, highlights 10 films and 10 TV series that have been "deemed culturally and artistically representative of the year's most significant achievements in the art of the moving image," a statement explains. The Institute relies on juries made up of critics, scholars, AFI members and trustees, as well as TV and film artists to help pick the winners.

The point isn't so much to name a sole winner but to recognize "the most outstanding achievements of the year ... not as competitors, but as a community."

The AFI TV Programs of the Year:

"The Americans"

"Breaking Bad"

"Game of Thrones"

"The Good Wife"

"House of Cards"

"Mad Men"

"Masters of Sex"

"Orange is the New Black"

"Scandal"

"Veep"

The AFI Movies of the Year:

"12 Years A Slave"

"American Hustle"

"Captain Phillips"

"Fruitvale Station"

"Gravity"

"Her"

"Inside Llewyn Davis"

"Nebraska"

"Saving Mr. Banks"

"The Wolf of Wall Street"

On January 10, the AFI will recognize the cast and crew behind these projects at an invite-only luncheon in Los Angeles. In the past, the AFI Awards have highlighted some of the biggest awards season contenders, such as 2012 Best Picture winner "Argo" and 2011 Best Picture nominees "Hugo," "The Help" and "Moneyball," among others.

Bob Gazzale, the institute's president and CEO, wants the AFI Awards to be a moment "for the most accomplished storytellers of 2013 to pause and be appreciated," he said in a statement. "Acknowledging their collective contributions to America's rich cultural legacy is both AFI's national mandate -- and our honor."
