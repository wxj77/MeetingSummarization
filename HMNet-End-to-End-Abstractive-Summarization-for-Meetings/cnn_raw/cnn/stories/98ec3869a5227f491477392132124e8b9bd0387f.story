(CNN) -- Miley Cyrus' deceased dog Floyd will live on forever -- as a tattoo on the singer's left side.

After publicly grieving the loss of her pup, who died in April, Cyrus has inked an image of Floyd onto the left side of her ribcage along with the inscription "A Little Help From My Fwends."

Her friends apparently got matching tattoos in as a show of solidarity.

During Sunday's NBC special on Cyrus' "Bangerz" tour that very few apparently watched, she talked about how she struggled with Floyd's death, which came in the middle of her global tour.

"I have to not make myself sick over it because that's what I did at first," the singer explained. "I loved him so much. I really shut down more than I've ever let myself. You can try to move on, your shell can continue on stage every night, but internally I wasn't (there)."

These days it seems that Cyrus is in a more healed place. And bonus: Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips says she has "a magic brain."
