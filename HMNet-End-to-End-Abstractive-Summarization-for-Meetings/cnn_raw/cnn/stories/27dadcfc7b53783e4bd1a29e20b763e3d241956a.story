(CNN) -- A man caught on camera beating a woman in front of her child has pleaded not guilty to first-degree attempted murder, Essex County prosecutors say.

Shawn Custis, 42, allegedly forced his way into a Millburn, New Jersey, home around 10 a.m. on June 21 and brutally beat the woman while her child sat motionless on a nearby couch. He fled the house with an undetermined amount of jewelry, Millburn police said. The entire episode was caught on the family's home security camera.

Custis is also charged with first-degree robbery, second-degree burglary and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, said Katherine Carter, a spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor's Office.

In the home video obtained by CNN affiliate WABC, Custis repeatedly punches the woman in the face while her child watches nearby. He throws her to the floor, chokes her, kicks her multiple times and throws her down a flight of stairs. He does not hurt the child. After he leaves, the woman goes upstairs to retrieve another child and waits with her two children for police to arrive.

The woman who was beaten told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey that she made a conscious decision to try to remain silent in an attempt to protect her daughter.

"I knew that if I started screaming, my daughter would too, and I was afraid that she would get hurt. I took it. I didn't cry the entire time," she said.

The woman was later taken to an area hospital, where she was treated for injuries to her face and legs, police said.

Custis was arrested Friday in New York City by the FBI Fugitive Task Force and detectives from the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. He was taken to the Essex County Detention Center, where he remained until his arraignment Tuesday.

CNN's attempts to reach an attorney representing Custis were unsuccessful.

Millburn is a small suburban community about 10 miles west of Newark.

No court date has yet been set, Carter said.
