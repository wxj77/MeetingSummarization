(EW.com) -- Since Lou Reed's death on Sunday, posts on blogs and social networks have been going up 24/7. Many, touching accounts of how the legend's music changed their lives. (Guilty.) Others, tearful RIP sentiments embedding favorite songs and YouTube clips eulogizing the rock iconoclast. (Guilty again.) For the lucky few, memories of The One Time They Ran Into Lou Reed; sometimes he was a total crank, sometimes he was a prince. (Sadly, none to share.)

But the best (and most anticipated) post about Lou Reed came Thursday, and evokes what has been sorely lacking in the personal remembrances: "incredible joy."

Writing for the East Hampton Star, Reed's widow Laurie Anderson reminds us that Lou Reed lived a beautiful life, had one last perfect day, and that because of it, and the memories and songs he's left us, it is indeed a "beautiful fall!"

EW: Lou Reed, though a hipster, gave the rock underground a glow of beauty

Read Laurie Anderson's full obituary below. Try to fight back that smileâ€”and tear. Or don't, actually. Just feel, as Anderson intends, the "incredible joy."

To our neighbors:

What a beautiful fall! Everything shimmering and golden and all that incredible soft light. Water surrounding us.

Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the past few years, and even though we're city people this is our spiritual home.

Last week I promised Lou to get him out of the hospital and come home to Springs. And we made it!

Lou was a tai chi master and spent his last days here being happy and dazzled by the beauty and power and softness of nature. He died on Sunday morning looking at the trees and doing the famous 21 form of tai chi with just his musician hands moving through the air.

Lou was a prince and a fighter and I know his songs of the pain and beauty in the world will fill many people with the incredible joy he felt for life. Long live the beauty that comes down and through and onto all of us.

â€” Laurie Anderson

his loving wife and eternal friend
