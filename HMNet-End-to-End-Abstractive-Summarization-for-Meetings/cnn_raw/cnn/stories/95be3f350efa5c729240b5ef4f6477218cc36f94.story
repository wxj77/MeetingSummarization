(CNN)Formula One star Fernando Alonso is on the road to recovery after a 150kph crash on Sunday.

The Spanish driver's manager Luis Garcia Abad tweeted a picture of Alonso smiling in a hospital bed -- less than 48 hours after a hair-raising smash at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.

Alonso's McLaren team confirmed in a statement Monday that the two-time world champion is making a "solid recovery" after undergoing a number of tests at a nearby hospital.

"From the scene of the incident he was driven to the circuit's medical center, where he was given first aid and, as per normal procedures, was sedated in preparation for an air-lift to hospital," read the statement.

"In hospital a thorough and complete analysis of his condition was performed, involving CT scans and MRI scans, all of which were completely normal.

"In order to provide the privacy and tranquility required to facilitate a peaceful recuperation, he is being kept in hospital for further observation, and to recover from the effects of the medication that successfully managed his routine sedation yesterday."

The incident occurred on Turn 3 of the circuit, which was hosting a testing event ahead of the start of the 2015 Formula One season next month.

The crash was caused by "the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time, and which had affected other drivers similarly," said McLaren.

Abad's tweet showed Alonso giving a thumbs up accompanied with the words: "Lunchtime! Thank you for your support!"

Alonso recently returned to McLaren, the team he raced for during the 2007 season, after a five year stint with Ferrari.

The 2014 season saw safety in F1 come into sharp focus after Marussia driver Jules Bianchi suffered severe head injuries in Japan last October.

He will be hoping to be on the grid for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, which takes places on March 15.
