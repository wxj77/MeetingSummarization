Mark Weinberger  The doctor from Merrillville, Indiana, disappeared more than five years ago. He was arrested this week while camping in northern Italy and was in custody at a hospital as he recovers from a wound that occurred when he tried to take his own life, Britain's The Guardian reports. A federal grand jury indicted Weinberger in 2006, accusing him of fraud and malpractice, according to Indiana's Post-Tribune. His wife, Michelle Kramer, told Larry King in August 2005 that they had been vacationing in Mykonos, Greece, and she woke up to find him gone. She has since filed for divorce.

Kurt Muse The U.S. Army is marking the 20th anniversary of the rescue of American Kurt Muse at the beginning of the military action that deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega. The Noriega regime reportedly held Muse in prison for nine months for operating an underground radio station, Voice of Liberty. In 1989, he was captured and put in solitary confinement -- until the elite Delta Force conducted a dramatic prison rescue. During the operation, the Hughes MH-6 Little Bird helicopter transporting Muse crashed, but he was not badly injured, a report says. Muse is now an author and a motivational speaker.

What makes a person intriguing?

There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news.

Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story.

But every day there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in.

They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.
