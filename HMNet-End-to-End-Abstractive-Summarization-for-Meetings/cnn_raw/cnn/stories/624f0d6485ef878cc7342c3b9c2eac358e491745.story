(EW.com) -- Is "Teen Mom 2" headed the way of "Jersey Shore"?

The NY Post reports the reality show's "days are numbered" in the wake of erratic behavior by co-star Jenelle Evans.

The series follows four women who became pregnant while in high school. The Post reports that Evans, following a stint in rehab, got married, became pregnant again, lost her baby due to a miscarriage and then publicly demanded a divorce in a profanity-laden tweet. Now the paper says the network is planning to shelve the show due to Evans' "out-of-control antics."

But MTV insisted to EW the show's fate has not yet been decided. "No decision has been made yet regarding a fifth season of Teen Mom 2," said a network spokesperson. "But the network is planning to air the fourth season this year and will announce the premiere date soon."

With 3.4 million viewers tuning in for the show's third season premiere last September, there's no reason the show couldn't simply recast one of its contestants if the only issue was Evans.

The network might also want to upscale its brand now that its investing heavily into scripted programming like "Awkward" and "Teen Wolf." MTV gave its original "Teen Mom" a series finale last year (then again, the network also dove back into the reality depths with Buckwild). Stay tuned...
