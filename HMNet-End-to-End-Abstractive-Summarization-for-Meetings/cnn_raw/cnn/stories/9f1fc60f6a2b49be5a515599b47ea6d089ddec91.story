(CNN Student News) -- March 24, 2014

President Obama is covering a lot of ground and serious subjects on an overseas trip. Today, we'll take a map-filled trek through his itinerary. Also: Will Scotland once again become an independent nation? And if so, how could that affect the Union Jack? We'll explore the possibilities, and we'll bring you a Character Study of a baseball player who helped save an umpire's life.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.

If Scotland votes for independence from the UK, how might it affect the economies of Scotland and Great Britain? What is the Union Jack?

How is high-level diplomacy, like a presidential visit, an important part of a country's foreign policy? What, if anything, do you think such visits accomplish?

2. What do you think is gained and lost when voters choose to create a new, independent country? What challenges might come with forming a new government and protecting the new country? What steps might the new leaders take to encourage their country's success?

3. What is CPR? Have you ever taken a CPR training class? If so, do you think you'd be able to use it if it were needed to save a life? If you have never taken a CPR class, is this something you'd ever like to learn? Why or why not?
