(CNN Student News) -- October 20, 2014

What are the risks, and what's the potential payoff? These are questions you'll find throughout today's show. We explain the tremendous risks that venture capitalists take and how those risks may or may not pay off. We explore why some countries might withdraw their bids to host the Olympic Games. And we feature a Character Study on a cross-country runner who risked a higher placement to help a rival.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
