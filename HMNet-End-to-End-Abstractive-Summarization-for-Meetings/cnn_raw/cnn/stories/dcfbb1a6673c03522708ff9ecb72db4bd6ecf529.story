(CNN) -- Groundhog Punxsutawney Phil emerged from his hovel Wednesday and did not see his shadow, which -- according to tradition -- means that spring will come early this year.

Phil, whose first name comes from the Pennsylvania town where he lives, emerged at 7:20 a.m. and hung out with the well-dressed gentlemen presiding over the event without retreating inside.

Wednesday's Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney marked the town's 125 celebration of the annual event.

Phil's prediction is likely welcome news for residents in the path of a monster snow and ice storm stretching from Texas to New Hampshire.
