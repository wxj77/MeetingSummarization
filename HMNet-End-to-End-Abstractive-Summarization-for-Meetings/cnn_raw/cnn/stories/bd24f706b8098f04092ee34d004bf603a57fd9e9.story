Washington (CNN) -- Former Charlotte Mayor Patrick Cannon is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday in connection with his March arrest for allegedly soliciting bribes in exchange for promises to use his political influence to curry favors.

According to court documents, Cannon, 47, is scheduled to admit guilt to a single fraud-related count. He could face up to 20 years in prison and possible fines, according to the statute cited in court papers.

The deal was struck nearly a month ago, but the documents were just made public on Monday.

The plea is the latest chapter in a political saga which Cannon, once a politico wunderkind who was initially elected to the city council in 1993 at age 26, just 20 years later found himself in the midst of an FBI corruption sting.

The federal agents posed as commercial real estate developers and investors interested in conducting business in Charlotte, federal authorities said.
