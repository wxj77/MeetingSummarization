Apple has set Sept. 9 as the date for a big announcement.

What will the company unveil?

"Wish we could say more," reads an invitation sent to media members on Thursday.

Multiple reports over the past few months have suggested that Apple plans to roll out two versions of an iPhone 6 this year, with screens that are 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, when measured diagonally.

Is bigger really better for Apple?

That would be a massive leap from the iPhone 5S and 5C's 4-inch screens and an apparent move to battle competitors like Samsung and HTC who have been making bigger phones for years.

But the "say more" tease prompted immediate speculation that new phones might not be all that's on the agenda. The safest bet is that a long-anticipated "iWatch" smartwatch will be introduced as well.

Apple was granted a patent for a smartwatch in July and reports have suggested now is the time for its debut. The device, which will compete with existing offerings from Samsung and other top competitors, is expected to have a heavy focus on health and fitness apps.

The Apple event will be at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts, a 2,400-seat venue in the company's hometown of Cupertino, California.

Apple has traditionally rolled out new iPhones in the fall, in advance of the winter holiday season.
