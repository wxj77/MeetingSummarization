(CNN) -- Hot air balloon rides at Egypt's popular tourist destination of Luxor are set to resume Wednesday, according to a statement on the Egyptian Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission's (CARC) website (Arabic).

President of the CARC, Mohamed Ibrahim Sherif, confirmed balloon flights would restart, the Egypt Independent reported.

Hot air balloon rides were banned in Luxor after a February 26 accident that killed 19 tourists.

Preliminary investigations suggested that gas canisters aboard the balloon exploded, causing it to plummet about 1,000 feet (300 meters) to the ground.

It was the world's deadliest hot air balloon accident in at least 20 years.
