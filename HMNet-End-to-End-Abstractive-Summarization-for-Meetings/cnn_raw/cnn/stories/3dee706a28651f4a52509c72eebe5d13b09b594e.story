(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund smashed six goals past Hamburg at the Signal Iduna Park on Saturday evening to record their best ever start to a Bundesliga season.

The 6-2 victory gives Jurgen Klopp's side a maximum 15 points from their opening five fixtures and keeps them two points clear of title rivals Bayern Munich.

Dortmund raced into a 2-0 lead midway through the first half with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opening the scoring in the 19th minute and Henrikh Mkhitaryan adding a second three minutes later.

Zhi Gin Lam pulled one back for the visitors in the 26th minute and shortly after the break a Heiko Westermann header leveled the scores.

Dortmund restored their advantage in the 65th minute when Aubameyang scored his second of the night before the floodgates opened eight minutes later as Robert Lewandowski netted followed by Marco Reus a minute later.

Both teams start their Champions League campaigns next week. Bayern entertain CSKA Moscow on Tuesday night while Dortmund travel to Italy to take on Rafa Benitez's Napoli on Wednesday.

Third-place Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League clash with Manchester United with a 3-1 over 10-man Wolfsburg -- Stefan Kiessling scoring a brace.
