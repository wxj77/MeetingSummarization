(CNN) -- England's Courtney Lawes was handed a two-match ban on Tuesday after he was found guilty of recklessly striking his opponent with a knee during his country's opening match of the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

Lawes, 22, made the tackle on Argentina's Mario Ledesma during England's 13-9 victory in Pool B on Saturday.

The Northampton Saints lock will now miss England's next two fixtures at the New Zealand tournament against Georgia on Sunday and Romania on September 24.

A plea of "not guilty" was entered by Lawes and he now has 48 hours in which he can launch an appeal.

"Following a review of broadcast footage, Lawes was cited by Independent Citing Commissioner Murray Whyte (Ireland) under Law 10.4(a) for striking Mario Ledesma with the knee," read a statement on the official Rugby World Cup web site.

"Taking into account mitigating factors being his excellent disciplinary record and remorse and the absence of aggravating factors, the Player was suspended for two weeks.

"In the context of the Rugby World Cup Tournament a week equates to one match. Therefore Lawes is suspended for two Rugby World Cup matches."

Lawes made his England debut in November 2009, in an 18-9 defeat to Australia at Twickenham, and now has nine caps.

The London-born player will be hoping he can still play a significant part in England's bid to reach a third successive World Cup final.
