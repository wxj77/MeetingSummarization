(CNN) -- Indian batsman Virender Sehwag admitted he was not too disappointed after he fell seven agonising runs short of a world record third triple-century in the third Test against Sri Lanka.

The 31-year-old opener had moved from his overnight score of 284 to 293 before he chipped a flighted delivery from Muttiah Muralitharan back to the bowler who claimed the catch at the second attempt.

"I am very happy I got at least 293 runs -- I am proud of what I have achieved," Sehwag told reporters at the close of the third day's play.

"Not many people have got two triple centuries and followed that with 293. So there is nothing to be disappointed about.

"I tried to take my time, but maybe the ball was not there to be hit. I misjudged the length and the ball went straight into Murali's hands.

"I always tell myself to bat the full day, and if there is a ball to be hit, just hit it. If I'm able to bat the whole day we will be in a good position."

The innings, which lasted 254 balls and included 40 boundaries and seven sixes, was the backbone of India's highest-ever total of 726-9 declared in reply to Sri Lanka's 393.

India skipper Mahendra Dhoni hit an unbeaten century before he opted to declare with a lead of 333 before Sri Lanka saw off a difficult few overs in their second innings to close on 11 without loss.

Elsewhere, England claimed a 2-1 series victory over South Africa in Durban after the fifth one-day international was abandoned without a ball being bowled.

Andrew Strauss' side became only the third team to beat the Proteas in a home one-day series after the umpires called the match off with the onset of another heavy downpour.

Meanwhile, a century from Dwayne Bravo was the highlight of a competitive opening day of the second Test between Australia and the West Indies at the Adelaide Oval.

The West Indies won the toss, elected to bat and finished the final session with momentum to be 336 for six at stumps.
