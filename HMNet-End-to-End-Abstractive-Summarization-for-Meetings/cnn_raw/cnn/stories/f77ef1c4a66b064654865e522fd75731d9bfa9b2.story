(CNN) -- Gisele Bundchen is more than just a pretty face.

According to Forbes, she is the highest-earning model of 2014. The publication estimates her fortune at "$47 million before taxes and fees in the last 12 months." It's the eighth year in a row that Bundchen has topped the list of beautiful women pulling in a pretty penny.

Contracts with companies like H&M and Chanel and gigs like being the face of Pantene hair products helped build an empire for Bundchen, who is married to football player Tom Brady.

Bundchen far outpaced the next highest-earning models, Doutzen Kroes and Adriana Lima, whose earnings were pegged at $8 million each.

The two Kates -- Kate Moss and Kate Upton -- Miranda Kerr and Liu Wen all pulled in $7 million.

Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover girl Upton is the highest-earning newcomer on the list.
