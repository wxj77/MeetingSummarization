Americans are concerned about Ebola, and many of them are unsatisfied with President Barack Obama's response, according to a new poll.

Forty-three percent of Americans surveyed said they disapprove of the way President Barack Obama has responded to the outbreak of Ebola compared to just 41 percent who approve, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll out Tuesday. Sixteen percent had no opinion on this issue.

Further, the percentage of people who say the U.S. is "doing all it reasonably can to try to prevent further cases of Ebola" across the country hovers at 33 percent, while those arguing the federal government should be doing more is nearly double that amount.
