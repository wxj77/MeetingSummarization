(CNN) -- Actor Matt Damon confirmed that he will return to the role of Jason Bourne in 2016 after stepping out of the spotlight for the fourth installment of the popular action series.

Damon's buddy Ben Affleck let the cat out of the bag in a red carpet interview Friday with E! News. The two were joking about whether they treat each other differently when one is in better shape than the other, when Affleck (intentionally or not) let the news slip.

"Well, (Damon's) going to be doing a Bourne movie next fall when I've just completely lost any semblance of physical fitness. So --" Affleck told E! News.

"Yes, next year," Damon responded to E! News when asked for clarification.

"It'll be in 2016 when the movie will actually come out. (Director) Paul Greengrass is going to do another one and that's all I ever said. I just needed him to say yes."

Damon played the title role of CIA assassin Jason Bourne in the first three installments of the series based on Robert Ludlum's popular spy novels. The fourth movie, 2012's "The Bourne Legacy," centered on CIA agent Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner.
