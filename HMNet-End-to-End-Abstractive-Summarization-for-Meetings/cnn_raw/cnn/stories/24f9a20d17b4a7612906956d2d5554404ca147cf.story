There's a lot of content for civics, social studies and history teachers today. Our first story centers on the trial that's begun for an accused Boston Marathon terrorist, and we examine the status of the death penalty in the U.S. From there, we take a look at the role of millennials in today's workforce, and we explore what could be the wreck of a World War II-era Japanese warship.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
