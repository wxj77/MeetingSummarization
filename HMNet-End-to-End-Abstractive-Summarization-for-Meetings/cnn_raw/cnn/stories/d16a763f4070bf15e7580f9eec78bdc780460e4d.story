(CNN) -- Sachin Tendulkar hit the fifth double century of his career to help India surpass Sri Lanka's huge first innings total as the second Test headed for a draw.

The man known as the "Little Master" more than lived up to his billing as he made 203 in India's mammoth total of 669-9.

Tendulkar was ably assisted by Suresh Raina who made 120 on his Test debut and captain MS Dhoni, who hit 76, as India finished day four 27 runs ahead in Colombo, leaving the likelihood of a result very slim.

Sri Lanka won the first Test of the three-match series in Galle when the retiring Muttiah Muralitharan produced a match-winning performance to become the first bowler to reach 800 Test wickets.

India began day four on 382-4 with Tendulkar on 108 not out. By the end of the day's play they had added an extra 300 runs to crush Sri Lanka's fleeting hopes of victory.

Tendulkar and Raina quickly took India past the follow-on target of 442 as they put together a partnership of 256 -- the third highest fifth-wicket partnership for India in Tests.

Raina was the first to go after lunch when he was caught by Kumar Sangakkara off the bowling of spinner Ajantha Mendis for 120.

Tendulkar was eventually removed by Tillakaratne Dilshan, captain Mahela Jayawardene taking the catch. The 37-year-old's knock took him joint-fifth in the list of double century makers in Tests.

Harbhajan Singh followed soon after Tendulkar for a duck but Abhimanyu Mithun proved a valuable companion for Dhoni as the pair put on 51.

Mithun was bowled by Mendis for 41 after taking India past Sri Lanka's total before Ishant Sharma and Pragyan Ohja held firm until the close of play.
