(CNN) -- On this week's Tech Check podcast, Doug Gross, Brandon Griggs and Stephanie Goldberg break down details from the new Steve Jobs biography.

The book, written by Walter Isaacson and released this week in the wake of Jobs' death, takes the reader behind the scenes of Jobs' rise to the top of the consumer-tech world, not always casting the Apple co-founder in a positive light.

We also look at Unthink, an upstart social-networking site that is trying to find a niche by being the anti-Facebook. Will calling Facebook, and rival Google+, "greedy giants" and adopting an anti-corporate approach, work? And what's up with that YouTube video?

Our Reader Comments of the Week come from our story on "Take This Lollipop," a viral Web video that uses your Facebook information to give the creepy, horror-inspired short film a personal twist.

And our Tech Fail of the Week goes to Netflix, which had some bad news to report this week after a couple of months of public-relations missteps the online movie-rental service would probably like to forget.

(Bonus: Wondering what tech-inspired Halloween costume Stephanie's donning this year? Of course you were. Tune in to find out!)
