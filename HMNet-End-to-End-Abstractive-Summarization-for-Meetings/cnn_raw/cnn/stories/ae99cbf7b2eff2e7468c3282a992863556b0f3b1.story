Tokyo (CNN)Police in Japan say they have arrested a 40-year-old man accused of fatally stabbing five neighbors in a farming community in Sumoto city.

The man has admitted stabbing three women aged 59, 76 and 84, as well as two men aged 62 and 82, Deputy Police Chief Keizo Okumoto told CNN. He said the accused refused to comment further as he was awaiting his lawyer.

The victims -- two couples and the 84-year-old woman -- lived within 100 meters (330 feet) of the suspect's home, police said.

According to local media, the accused and the victims shared the same surname, but it is unclear if they are related.

Sumoto city is on Awaji Island, Hyogo prefecture, in Japan.
