We also discuss a data breach at a major U.S. retailer, and we offer some suggestions for how shoppers can protect themselves against credit card fraud. Finally, we look back at some significant events and uplifting stories from the past 12 months.

Teachers, please note that CNN Student News will not air through the rest of 2013. The program will return in January.
