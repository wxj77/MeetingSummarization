(CNN) -- Samsung Electronics announced plans Wednesday to file preliminary injunction motions in Paris and Milan, Italy, to block the sale of Apple's iPhone 4S there.

Samsung is accusing Apple of two patent infringement, both dealing with wireless telecommunications technology.

It did not rule out filing preliminary injunctions in other countries as well.

Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.

Apple announced the latest incarnation of its smartphone -- the iPhone 4S -- on Tuesday.

The two companies have been at odds, suing and countersuing, for several months -- both accusing the other of patent infringements.

Apple claims Samsung's Galaxy tablets and smartphones have copied its own successful iPad tablets and iPhones. Samsung denies the accusations and have made several of its own.

The latest accusation Wednesday deal with the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) standards for 3G mobile handsets.

"Apple has continued to flagrantly violate our intellectual property rights and free ride on our technology, and we will steadfastly protect our intellectual property," Samsung said in a statement.

Worldwide, millions of mobile phones carry CDMA technology while others carry GSM.

By incorporating both in its new iPhone 4S, Apple said it intends for it to be a "world phone," working on any mobile network around the world.
