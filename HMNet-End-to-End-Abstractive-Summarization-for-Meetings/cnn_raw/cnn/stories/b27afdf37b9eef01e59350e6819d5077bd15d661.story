(CNN) -- A South African man was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison for the killing of white supremacist leader Eugene Terreblanche, a lawyer in the case said.

Chris Mahlangu was convicted on four counts including murder, for which he got life, lawyer Zola Majavu said.

Terreblanche, the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, or AWB), was killed in April 2010 following an apparent dispute over wages with workers on his farm.

Terreblanche, 69, was bludgeoned with clubs and stabbed with a machete during the attack at his farm near Ventersdorp in South Africa's North West province, police said.

The trial began in October.

Police charged Mahlangu and a 16-year-old in the death. It was not immediately clear what sentence the minor got.

The AWB is best known for trying to block South Africa's effort to end apartheid. The group used terrorist tactics in a bid to stall the country's first all-race vote in 1994, killing more than 20 people in a wave of bombings on the eve of the elections.

Terreblanche was convicted of a 1996 attempted murder of a black man who worked as a security guard on his farm. He served about two-thirds of a five-year sentence.

CNN's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report.
