(CNN) -- Another actor was injured Thursday night while playing the role of Spider-man in "Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark" on Broadway, according to a statement released by the show's spokesman Rick Miramontez.

Actor Daniel Curry is in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital after sustaining an injury to his foot during last night's performance, the statement said.

Despite the injury, Miramontez claims that the technical aspects of the Broadway show are in working order and that equipment malfunction played no role in the injury. The show is scheduled to continue on as planned.

"Our thoughts are with Daniel and his family," the statement concluded.

Curry's injury on Thursday occurred almost two-and-a-half years after a series of other maladies and safety concerns caused the show's opening to be postponed several months. In March 2011, the show's lead actress T.V. Carpio was hurt performing in an onstage battle scene, according to a spokesman.

In December 2010, actor Christopher Tierney also suffered an injury while wearing the red mask of the Marvel Comics superhero. He suffered four broken ribs, a hairline skull fracture, a broken scapula, a bruised lung, three cracked vertebrae and broken bones below his elbow as a result of his fall, his father said. The accident was serious enough to prompt producers to announce new safety measures.

Additionally, in December 2010, an actress suffered a concussion offstage during the first preview night.

After the series of headline-catching injuries and accidents, the musical's debut was put off for the sixth time after the producers replaced their director. The producers said the delay would give the show's creators time to work on various revisions, including improving the musical arrangements and sound quality.

The revised version of the show opened in June 2012.
