(CNN)The bot world is getting bigger.

Paramount, Michael Bay and Lorenzo di Bonaventura are enlisting Akiva Goldsman to help the studio develop ideas and a team to work on future "Transformers" spinoffs and sequels, a source tells THR.

The move signals that the studio is looking toward making its Hasbro toy-inspired franchise into a universe in the same vein as Marvel's "Avengers," Universal's monster universe (which will kick off with "The Mummy" in 2016) and Warner Bros.' DC Comics superhero universe. Paramount had no comment.
