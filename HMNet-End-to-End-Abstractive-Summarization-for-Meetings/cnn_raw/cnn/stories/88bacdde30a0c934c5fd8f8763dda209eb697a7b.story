(CNN) -- Brett Favre's 297-game NFL record for consecutive starts for quarterbacks won't be getting any longer.

The 41-year-old "Iron Man," who has held the record since 1999, was out for Monday night's game against the New York Giants, Vikings spokesman Jeff Anderson said.

Favre sprained a joint in his throwing arm during last week's game against the Buffalo Bills and didn't throw a ball during Saturday's walk-through. He had limited participation in Friday's practice, the first time all week he participated at all.

He got a reprieve Sunday, the scheduled date for the game with the Giants. The Vikings were forced to reschedule the game when the inflatable roof of the Metrodome collapsed under 16 inches of snow. The game was played Monday in Detroit.

Favre, knocked out of last week's game on his first passing attempt, has started every game since the fourth game of his 1992 season with the Green Bay Packers. He started every game in the 2008 season with the New York Jets, and every game since joining the Vikings in 2009. Including playoff games, he's started an almost unbelievable 321 consecutive games.

That lengthy career means a lot more records -- he is the only NFL quarterback to throw more than 500 touchdown passes or to pass for more than 70,000 yards, among many others. His 297 straight starts puts him first for all non-special teams players as well as quarterbacks.

He took over the quarterbacks lead in consecutive starts on November 7, 1999, against the Chicago Bears. It was his 117th consecutive start, putting him one ahead of the then-record holder, Ron Jaworski of the Philadelphia Eagles. Jaworski held the record since 1984.

Favre's record is likely to stand for at least six years, which is how long it would take Favre's nearest competitor in this department -- Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts -- to catch him. Manning, who has started all his games with the Colts, beginning in September 1998, has 205 consecutive starts.
