(CNN) -- Juan Martin del Potro is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines after the world No. 8 announced he will undergo wrist surgery on Monday.

The 2009 U.S. Open champion, who needs surgery to fix a problem with his left wrist, had a similar operation on his right wrist in 2010 and was subsequently out for eight months.

The Argentine first felt pain in his left wrist in August 2012 and he took painkillers to deal with the injury at last year's U.S. Open.

But the problem resurfaced at January's Australian Open, the first grand slam of 2014, where Del Potro lost in the second round to Roberto Bautista Agut.

"I want to tell you that after a period of medical treatment, in which we tried to be competitive on a tennis court, and following new examinations done today, my doctor Richard Berger, decided that I should have surgery to fix the problem on my left wrist," the 25-year-old said on his official Facebook page.

"Obviously, it's not the easiest choice or the happiest moment of my career. I experienced a similar situation and I know how hard it is to be out of the tour, the desire to return, the endless weeks of recovery and how difficult it is to start fighting for the top spots in the rankings again."

Since returning from his right wrist injury in 2010, Del Potro has claimed 11 titles -- most recently defeating Bernard Tomic to win January's Sydney International event.

"As always, thank you to those who express their support in any part of Argentina and the world, during tournaments, on the streets or social networks," added Del Potro.

"The strength you send me and my desire will be crucial during my recovery."

The highlight of Del Potro's career so far came at Flushing Meadows five years ago, when he beat Roger Federer in five sets to win his first grand slam title.
