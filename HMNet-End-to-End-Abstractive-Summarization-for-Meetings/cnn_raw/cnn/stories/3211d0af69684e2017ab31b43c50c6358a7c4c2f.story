(Mashable) -- Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, saved a woman from a burning house late Thursday night.

The mayor is a highly active Twitter user, and commonly uses the social network to find and help Newark residents who are in need.

Predictably, the Internet caught onto the story and it took on a life of its own.

A new Tumblr blog, SuperCoryBooker is actively creating memes about the mayor. The hashtag #CoryBookerStories, which is giving the Newark mayor the Chuck Norris treatment, is also trending in the United States.
