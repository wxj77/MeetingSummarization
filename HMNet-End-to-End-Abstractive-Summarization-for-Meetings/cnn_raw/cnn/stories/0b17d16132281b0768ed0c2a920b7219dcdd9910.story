(EW.com) -- Good news (we guess?) for Ronn Moss fans: Don't go looking for a brand new Ridge to take over for the old one on CBS' "The Bold and the Beautiful."

Once Moss' last episode airs on Sept. 14, "B&B" has no plans to fill the void, the sudser's head writer told TV Guide.

"Ridge will not be dead or presumed dead," said Bradley Bell. "He will just not be in the picture. I don't want to do a presumed death because I don't want the story that follows to be all about Ridge. This will be a Brooke story. Ridge is a pivotal part of the show and he will be back in a matter of time...and probably not all that much time. I will continue writing for the character. I'm looking at this in two phases, really. There will be a period of time without Ridge, which is where some new, interesting avenues for Brooke will come into play. But at some point it will be necessary for Ridge to return to the show. Who will be playing the role at that point remains to be seen."

EW broke the news last week that Moss has decided to leave CBS soap that he's been on since its 1987 debut. He said this on his Facebook page: "I want to make sure, without any doubt, that you guys all know how much I love you. Your support during this time and hopefully beyond is everything. I can't say anything yet, but soon will explain. Hang in there with me, We have a wonderful new journey ahead of us.

Try and not be sad, angry, disappointed.. It's been a great run and all good things end eventually. As this door closes, others are opening.

I want you all to come with me through these new doors of opportunities and experience how cool it's going to be. Have faith, be strong, know I'm eternally yours."

Moss played fashion magnate Ridge Forrester -- one of the"core four" on Bold that includes Susan Flannery as Stephanie Forrester, John McCook as Eric Forrester, and Katherine Kelly Lang as Brooke Logan. Bell also told TV Guide that "Ronn's circumstances are unique" and that "what happened here will not be widespread." (Translation: Don't look for any more unexpected departures).

Bell also said that once he does decide to fill Ridge role, "I might go a little younger. But we'll be true to the age range that's been established. I do have people in mind in terms of a recast â€” some very interesting people."

The head writer isn't giving up hope that Moss may reprise the role at a later date.
