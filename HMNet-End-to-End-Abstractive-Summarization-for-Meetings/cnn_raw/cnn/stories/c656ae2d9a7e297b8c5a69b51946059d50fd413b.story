London, England (CNN) -- Passengers on a British Airways flight from London to Hong Kong got a scare this week when a recorded announcement said the plane was making an emergency landing.

The recording, however, was triggered by a computer glitch -- not by an actual emergency -- and the cabin crew immediately told passengers it had been a mistake, a BA spokesman said Friday.

"We would like to apologize to passengers onboard the flight for causing them undue distress," the airline said in a statement.

The Sun newspaper reported it happened as the plane, carrying 275 passengers, was over the North Sea. It quoted one passenger who said people were terrified to hear the recording, which said, "This is an emergency announcement. We may shortly need to make an emergency landing on water."
