(CNN) -- A New Orleans bartender who accused Oscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr. of pushing her has dropped all charges against him, bar management said Wednesday.

The unnamed female bartender told police Gooding stopped by the Old Absinthe House in the French Quarter in the early hours of Tuesday with a group of people. She said Gooding soon became angry with other patrons who recognized him and wanted to take pictures with him.

The bartender told police she asked Gooding to calm down, at which point he allegedly pushed her away. Another employee called 911 and told Gooding to leave, and as he left, he pushed the bartender again, police said.

Police said Gooding was presumed to be intoxicated, and a misdemeanor battery warrant was issued for his arrest.

Gooding and his attorney met with police Wednesday and was given a court summons, police said, but later in the day the bar's management said the bartender chose to drop all charges.

"While we will continue to investigate this matter internally, we are hopeful that this will put an end to the matter and allow everyone to get back to enjoying all that our great city has to offer!" a statement from the management read.

Gooding is starring in the upcoming movie "The Butler," filming in New Orleans. He won an Academy Award in 1997 for best supporting actor in the film "Jerry Maguire" and starred in this year's "Red Tails," about the Tuskegee Airmen.
