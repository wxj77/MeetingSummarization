(CNN) -- It's standard fare for a neck-and-neck rivalry game with one second left. Outcome A: Make the field goal and win. Outcome B: Miss it and go into overtime.

But there were some factors sweetening the suspense in this one. It was an Iron Bowl, generally an intense matchup, but the winner would claim the SEC West title and stamp a ticket to Atlanta for the conference championship.

Then there are the teams, No. 4 Auburn and No. 1 Alabama, which have collectively won the last four national titles, with Alabama owning three of those and mopping the floor with the rebuilding Tigers 49-0 in last year's contest.

If it wasn't spicy enough, Auburn's special teams had been on fire, blocking an earlier field goal and partially blocking a punt. Meanwhile, Alabama kicker Cade Foster had been terrible, missing three field goals, including the blocked one, prompting Alabama Coach Nick Saban to trot out a frosh to attempt the game winner.

And, of course, the play turned out to be anything but standard when Auburn's Chris Davis invoked Outcome C, catching the ball deep in his end zone, and running it back 109 yards -- including a 15-yard sideline-tightrope scamper as he neared midfield -- for the touchdown.

Auburn fans went bonkers, as Alabama fans hung their heads, neither believing what they'd seen. Here are a few of our favorite reactions:

Auburn fans go nuts

Caped crusader goes for swim

House divided

Bar squealer

Making children cry

Brother hates Bama

Exciting stuff, huh? Well, get a load of this: If Auburn wins the SEC Championship, and Florida State and Ohio State both lose their conference championships, Alabama could get a shot at redemption at the BCS Championship in Pasadena, California.

It's unlikely it could top this weekend's Iron Bowl, but you never know.
