As Joey Donner in the 1999 film "10 Things I Hate About You," Andrew Keegan attracted his fair share of fans.

Now, he's attracting converts.

According to Vice, the actor has started a new age temple and spiritual movement  in Venice, California. Full Circle is described as "advanced spiritualism."

"Synchronicity. Time. That's what it's all about," Keegan told Vice. "Whatever, the past, some other time. It's a circle; in the center is now. That's what it's about."

The former teen heartthrob said his spiritual journey began after he and some friends were attacked on Venice Beach in 2011. The incident happened around the same time as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and Keegan said he began to see an odd series of occurrences that led him to start Full Circle.

"I had a moment where I was looking at a streetlamp, and it exploded," he said. "That was a weird coincidence. At a ceremony, a heart-shaped rose quartz crystal was on the altar, and synchronistically, this whole thing happened. It's a long story, but basically the crystal jumped off the altar and skipped on camera. That was weird."

It all prompted him to conclude that "the mission is to take the war out of our story, which is essentially peace but activated peace," he said.

His church, which started occupying its building in May, now has several members. Keegan says it's not a cult but a community.

"I very much speak what comes through (while) in the collective," he said. "We create a resonance of balance and equality of the crew."
