(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic retained his Miami Masters 1000 title with an emphatic 6-1 7-6 final victory over Britain's Andy Murray Sunday.

The World No.1 was at his relentless best to avoid a repeat of his defeat to Murray in Dubai last month.

The pair had also played an epic semifinal in the Australian Open at the start of the year, Djokovic going on to take the opening grand slam of the season.

This was the Serbian's first title since his Melbourne heroics and his third on the hard courts of Crandon Park.

World No.4 Murray was always on the back foot after losing the opening set, being broken twice and unable to make an impression on the rock solid Djokovic service.

Murray fought hard in the second set, clinging on to his own service despite being taken to deuce four times.

Djokovic gained the early mini-break in the tiebreak and always kept his nose in front.

Murray closed to 3-2 after winning a 25-shot rally with a backhand sliced drop shot, but he double faulted on the next point and Djokovic took full advantage.

He closed out the tiebreak and the match as Murray hit long, but admitted after his win that the latter stages of the second set were crucial.

"Andy was very close to winning the second set. The match could have gone either way," he said in his post-match interview.

"I had opportunities to break in the second set and close out the match quicker but then he might have won it later on.

"I thought I played really well from beginning to end. There were a lot of long rallies and they were tough conditions."

Both players will now return to Europe for the clay court season where Djokovic will be searching for his first French Open title, while Murray will continue his quest for a first grand slam title under new coach Ivan Lendl.
