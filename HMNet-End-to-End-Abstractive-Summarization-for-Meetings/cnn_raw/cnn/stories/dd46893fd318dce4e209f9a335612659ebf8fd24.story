(CNN) -- Parma have signed AC Milan's 18-year-old Alberto Paloschi in a co-ownership deal, the Serie B club announced on their Web site on Wednesday.

Paloschi scored with his first touch when he made his debut as a Milan sub in February.

Paloschi made an instant impact when he made his debut for Milan in February, scoring against Siena with his first touch as substitute.

He scored twice in seven appearances last season but his prospects of regular first team football this season diminished sharply after the signings of Andrei Shevchenko and Ronaldinho.

Parma were relegated from Serie A last season..

Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani has said that that Italy full-back Massimo Oddo could be leaving soon.

Galliano told Gazzetta dello Sport: "Lyon are interested in our full-back and anything is possible."

The 32-year-old former Lazio right-back is likely to lose his first team spot to new signing Gianluca Zambrotta from Barcelona.

Oddo was in Italy's World Cup winning squad in Germany in 2006 but was not chosen for the Euro 2008 finals in June.

Lyon already have an Italian at left-back in Fabio Grosso, who was also a World Cup winner in 2006.
