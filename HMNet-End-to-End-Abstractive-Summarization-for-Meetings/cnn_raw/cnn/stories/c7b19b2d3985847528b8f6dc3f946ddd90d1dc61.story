(EW.com ) -- Tumblr just became a lot more than the place to find the best GIFs.

In anticipation of its newest 10-episode series, "Halt and Catch Fire," AMC is launching a two-week, full-episode sneak preview on Tumblr and AMC.com, making it the first-ever television show to premiere on Tumblr.

"Halt and Catch Fire," created by Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers, follows the rise of the PC in the early 1980s, roughly one year after IBM.

"Halt and Catch Fire is a fun ride through the early days of the PC era, a time when no one could imagine a portable computer weighing less than 15 pounds, let alone one that was a few ounces and doubled as a phone," AMC President Charlie Collier said in a statement. "It's a perfect show for summer and -- given the subject matter -- a good fit for Tumblr's first TV series premiere and AMC's first social media screening."

In addition to the launch of the new series, AMC also plans to launch a branded network Tumblr page to be integrated into AMC.com.

"Tumblr is the biggest platform for social TV and destination for many of AMC's most passionate fans," Global Head of Brand Partnerships at Tumblr Lee Brown said. "We're excited to welcome Halt and Catch Fire and the rest of AMC's lineup to the home of fandoms through Tumblr integration on AMC.com and to offer this first look at Halt and Catch Fire to our community."

Starting on Monday, May 19 and running through Saturday, May 31, viewers will be able to preview the new series on Tumblr and AMC.com before it premieres on AMC on Sunday, June 1 at 10 p.m.
