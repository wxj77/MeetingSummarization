(CNN) -- Four-time NBA All-Star Chris Paul has been traded from the New Orleans Hornets to join the Los Angeles Clippers in a deal that sends Eric Gordon, Al-Farouq Aminu and Chris Kaman in the opposite direction.

As part of the deal for the point guard, the Clippers have also given the Hornets a first-round pick in the 2012 draft.

The Hornets were eager to trade Paul, with the 26-year-old's contract due to expire at the end of the forthcoming season.

NBA commissioner David Stern was required to approve the deal due to the fact that the Hornets are owned by the league.

New Orleans general manager Dell Demps was on the verge of sealing a trade last week which would have seen Paul head to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the NBA vetoed a three-team deal claiming the Hornets could do better.

"We wanted to make sure that we got the best possible deal for a player of Chris' caliber, and we feel great about the outcome," Jac Sperling, appointed by Stern as governor of the Hornets after the league acquired the team in December 2010, told the NBA's official website.

The Clippers' franchise has been largely a losing one over the years and has been in the shadow of the long-successful Lakers, who have been champions 17 times to their local rivals' none.

Paul's presence is expected to invigorate the team. He has been in the NBA for six years, leading the league in steals on four occasions, and will be paired with Blake Griffin, last year's NBA Rookie of the Year.

The North Carolina-born star averaged 18.1 points and 2.7 rebounds in three years with the Hornets. Last season, Paul played in 80 games averaging 15.9 points, 9.8 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 2.4 steals.

Shooting guard Gordon heads to New Orleans after three years in Los Angeles, while 21-year-old Aminu played his rookie year with the Clippers last season.

Center Kaman was an All-Star in 2010 and spent eight years at the Staples Center.
