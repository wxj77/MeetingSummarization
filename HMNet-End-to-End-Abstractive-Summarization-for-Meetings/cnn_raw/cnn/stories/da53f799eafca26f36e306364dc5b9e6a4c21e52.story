(CNN) -- We've already seen actor Ian Ziering's dance moves on "Dancing With the Stars," but his reported upcoming gig in Las Vegas is going to require a lot less clothing.

The 49-year-old, who's still beloved for playing heartthrob Steve Sanders on the '90s classic, "Beverly Hills, 90210," is slated to perform as a guest star and host with the Chippendales male revue in June.

And, probably like some of his fans, Ziering couldn't be more thrilled.

"I am so excited to be a part of this iconic worldwide organization," Ziering told Us Weekly. "It's really a dream come true!"

His gig will run from June 6 to June 30, and will include performances every Thursday through Sunday at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino.

"Actors and performers never know what their next job will be," Ziering said. "When I got the call from Chippendales, my jaw dropped. ... I am passionate about health and fitness, so I've kept in shape, and dancing is something I've always enjoyed, so why not?"

Ziering isn't the only former "DWTS" contestant to substitute samba for a Chippendales-style striptease: Ziering's fellow '90s heartthrob Joey Lawrence has donned the bowtie before, as has former "Bachelor" Jake Pavelka.
