(CNN) -- Two sailors were killed and a third injured during a training exercise at California's Camp Pendleton on Monday morning, according to a spokesman.

The accident occurred at 8 a.m. when the 7-ton bulk water tanker the sailors were driving rolled over, said Cmdr. Greg Hicks, a U.S. Navy 3rd Fleet spokesman.

Hicks said the names of the victims are being withheld until their families can be notified. Meanwhile, the injured sailor was taken to a nearby hospital where he is listed in stable condition, Hicks said.

The U.S. Marine Corps will conduct the investigation because it happened on their base, he said.

A Marine Corps instructor was killed during a January 14 training exercise at Camp Pendleton when the amphibious assault vehicle he was riding in capsized and sank.
