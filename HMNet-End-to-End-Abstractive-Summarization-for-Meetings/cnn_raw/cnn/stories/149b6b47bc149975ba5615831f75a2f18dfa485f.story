Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A blast at a busy market in northwest Pakistan killed at least 35 people and wounded more than 60 Tuesday, an official said.

The explosion occurred in the Jamrud Market in the Khyber Agency, one of seven districts in Pakistan's volatile tribal region, which borders Afghanistan.

The bomb was placed in a vehicle belonging to a local militia group fighting against militants in the area, said Jameel Khan, a government official.

The bomb was then remotely detonated, he said, citing the initial investigation.

The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad condemned the bombing. "By targeting innocent people going about their business, the extremists who plan and perpetrate these attacks show their contempt for the value of human life," an embassy statement said.
