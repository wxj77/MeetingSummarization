(CNN)Calise Manning is being called a hero for helping her pregnant mother and calling 911 operators in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

"She's shaking and she's having a baby," Calise tells a dispatcher in 911 audio obtained by CNN affiliate WWMT.  "My mom is really pregnant and she's having a boy and she really needs help."

Her mother Centerria Manning, who was 9-months pregnant and epileptic, had apparently fallen to the floor in the midst of a seizure on Wednesday. She  said they had practiced what to do in an emergency.

"I was so proud of her, because we practiced and I teach her because I am epileptic," Manning said.  "I (taught) her the address and my full name and things like that, and how to dial 911." Her fianc√©e was at work at the time.

In a lighter moment during the nearly 7 1/2 minute call, a dispatcher asks Calise "How old are you honey?" Calise responds, "four," before adding an important detail.  "Yes, and I'm almost getting bigger."

The mother was taken to the hospital where her healthy baby brother, TJ Manning, was born Friday morning.

Wearing an "I'm the Big Sister" T-shirt, Calise told the WWMT reporter at the hospital "It was really good to ride in the ambulance with mom."

The dispatcher who handled the call told the station that she's recommending Calise get an award for being calm in a scary situation.
