(CNN) -- Apple is indeed planning to introduce an iPhone with a larger screen, according to sources speaking to the Wall Street Journal.

The company has reportedly ordered 4-inch screens from its suppliers, a bump from the currently standard 3.5-inch screen size that Apple has been using since the original iPhone appeared in 2007.

Rumors of a larger-screened iPhone have been floating around for some time now -- especially since comparable Android phones gotten bigger and bigger, like the Galaxy Note and it's monster 5.3-inch screen.

But many observers --including those of us at Ars' Infinite Loop --have not bought into those rumors. You can count me as a critic of this rumor, but there may be more to the large-screened iPhone rumors than we originally thought.

We're not likely to find out the truth anytime soon, thoughâ€”the report says production is slated to begin next month, and Apple isn't expected to roll out new iPhones until the fall.
