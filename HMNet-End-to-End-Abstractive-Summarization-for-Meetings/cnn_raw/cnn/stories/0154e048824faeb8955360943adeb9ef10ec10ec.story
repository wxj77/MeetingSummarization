A nurse has died of Ebola in the Malian capital of Bamako, the health ministry said Wednesday, sparking fears that the nation has not yet defeated the deadly virus.

This is the second confirmed Ebola fatality in the West African country. The first victim, a 2-year-old girl, died last month after she traveled to Mali with her grandmother from Guinea -- one of three countries hardest hit by the outbreak in the region.

The clinic where the nurse died has been quarantined, and the government  has urged citizens to report suspected cases.

The first case prompted fears that the virus was spreading beyond Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- the three nations which have seen the most cases of Ebola.

Shortly after the toddler was diagnosed, dozens of people who came into contact with her were quarantined, including medical workers. It's unclear whether the nurse was among those who were in contact with the child.

The virus has killed at least 4,960 people and infected more than 13,000, mostly in the three nations, according to the World Health Organization.

There is currently no cure or vaccine for Ebola.

As the world reels from the outbreak, scores of companies are fast-tracking tests for various vaccines, and hope to have millions of experimental doses by next year.

Scientists racing to stop the epidemic are trying various experimental drugs on patients, including ZMapp and TKM-Ebola.

Health care workers in affected nations will get the first opportunity to try the experimental vaccines, the WHO said.

Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.
