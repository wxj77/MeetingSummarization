(CNN) -- One down, one more to go.

The role of Johanna Mason — one of the most anticipated new characters in "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" — may be taken. Lionsgate has reportedly already offered the part — a cunning, sarcastic Tribute from District 7 — to Malone, star of Saved!, Sucker Punch, and, most recently, the A&E mini-series "Hatfields & McCoys." EW reported last week that Malone was in the running for the role.

Mason, who eventually allies herself with Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss and Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, also appears in Suzanne Collins' third book Mockingjay, so we can probably expect to see Malone in forthcoming sequels. Still to be cast is the role of Finnick Odair, another Tribute that aids the series' protagonists, even though production is expected to begin in September with Francis Lawrence directing.
