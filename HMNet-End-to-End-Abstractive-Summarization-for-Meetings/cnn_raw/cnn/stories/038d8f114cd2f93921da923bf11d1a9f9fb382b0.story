(CNN) -- Ukraine's FC Dnipro earned a 1-0 victory over English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur as the knockout stages of the Europa League got underway on Thursday.

Yevhen Konoplyanka scored from the penalty spot nine minutes from the end to hand the Ukrainian Premier League side a priceless lead ahead of next week's return leg at White Hart Lane.

A national day of mourning was declared on Thursday following the loss of dozens of lives in anti-government protests.

Both sets of players wore black armbands as a mark of respect to the dead and observed a minutes silence before the start of the match.
