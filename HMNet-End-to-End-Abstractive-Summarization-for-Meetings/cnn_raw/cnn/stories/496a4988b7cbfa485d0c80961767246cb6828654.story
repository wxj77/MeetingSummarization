(EW.com) -- Several top-level producers of "The Simpsons" have agreed to take pay cuts to keep the long-running animated show on the air, sources confirm.

Some -- though not all -- of the producers of the Fox series have indicated they're willing to have their pay reduced to continue the series beyond its current record-setting 23rd season.

The cast, however, have yet to agree to terms with the studio. As Variety reported, "Simpsons" studio 20th Century Fox TV has demanded a 45 percent pay cut and the voice actors countered with a 30% reduction, plus a piece of the back end. The studio rejected that proposal.

Fox has previously declared the iconic hit is no longer sustainable under its current deal and is demanding salary reductions in order for the series to continue.

All sides, however, strongly believe a deal will be reached. Even with reduced paychecks, there's still plenty of money on the table. Nobody wants to see "The Simpsons" end its legacy without a proper series finale. And a final season would likely create considerable buzz and renewed interest in the show, which is used to launch the rest of Fox's Sunday night animated block.
