(CNN)  -- Kuwait's leader dissolved parliament on Wednesday and called for early elections, after the Cabinet resigned this week following a power struggle with the government.

Kuwait's emir has dissolved parliament following conflict between the Cabinet and govenrment.

The emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, said he was forced to dissolve parliament to safeguard Kuwait's national unity, citing the fragile political situation in the region and his primary concern for internal security and stability.

New elections have been set for May 17, according to Kuwait's state-run news agency, KUNA.

According to Kuwait's constitution, elections must be held within 60 days of dissolving parliament.

Kuwait's parliament, made up mostly of opposition politicians, has been locked in a feud with the government which it accuses of corruption and abuse of power.

Parliament has continuously called for some government members to be investigated, which is what prompted the Cabinet to resign this week.

Al-Sabah said he tried to get lawmakers and government ministers to reconcile their differences, but they only inflamed the situation through their statements to the media. E-mail to a friend
