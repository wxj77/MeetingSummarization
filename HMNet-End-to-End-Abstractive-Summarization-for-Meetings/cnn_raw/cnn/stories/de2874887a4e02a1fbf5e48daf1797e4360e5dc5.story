(CNN)North Korea has arrested what it claims are two spies who worked for South Korea's intelligence service, a North Korean official said Thursday on condition of anonymity.

The men, identified as Kim Kook Kie and Choi Chun Kil, are accused of committing crimes of "terrorism" and bringing in "large quantities of forged currency," the North Korean source said.

The official said Kim had made a declaration of guilt. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the declaration or whether, if Kim made one, it was made under duress.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service told CNN that "the information you've obtained is not true."

"We don't have any information that members of NIS were arrested in North Korea," an NIS representative said.
