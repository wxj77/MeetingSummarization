(CNN) -- Paris Saint-Germain completed the signing of Brazilian international defender Alex from Chelsea Friday on a two-and-a-half-year deal.

The 29-year-old is re-united with PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti, who was in charge at Chelsea when they won the English Premier League and FA Cup double in 2010.

He had fallen out of favor under Andre Villas-Boas and was also a target for fellow EPL side Queens Park Rangers, but chose the Parisian giants.

"I knew about PSG's immense stature and that made me want to come," Alex told the club's official website.

"For the past two months I've wanted to leave Chelsea and we finally opened talks with PSG. Everything went very well."

Alex has won 18 Brazil caps and was in their squad which claimed the 2007 Copa America, but he will be battling five other players, including club captain Mamadou Sakho, for places in central defense.

"I know him very well. He's a fantastic man and a fantastic player. He's a good investment for the team," said Ancelotti.

Ancelotti, who took charge in December, also revealed that the Qatari-backed club had ruled out an immediate move for Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez.

The Italian said they had been in discussions with Tevez and his connections but talks had broken down.

"We discussed a move with the player but there is ultimately no agreement," Ancelotti told the club website, but left the door open for a future deal.

Meanwhile, Tevez's advisor Kia Joorabchian told British radio station TalkSport that it was likely the striker would stay at City until the summer.

"We've been in negotiations with three big clubs but I don't think they have reached the figures Manchester City want," Joorabchian claimed.

Joorabchian also said he believed his player could end up at PSG next season.

"PSG want to build a long-term project and I think Carlos is six months too early for them. But there is a big chance he will go there in the summer," he added.
