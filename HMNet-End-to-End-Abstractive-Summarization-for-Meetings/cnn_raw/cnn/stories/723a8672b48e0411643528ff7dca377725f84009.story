(CNN)  -- Martin Kaymer's victory in last year's U.S. PGA Championship has given him the "belief and motivation" to add to his major tally at this week's British Open at Royal St George's this week.

The 26-year-old German burst to prominence with his victory at Whistling Straits and had a brief spell as the world's top-ranked golfer earlier this year.

Kaymer told CNN that his triumph had impacted on him in a "very positive" way as he approached each major.

"It gave me a lot of belief and motivation I could do well, especially coming to big events like the British Open," he said.

Kaymer believes that putting could well prove the key to victory come Sunday on the links course in south-east England.

"You will miss the greens and you will have some long putts with a lot of slopes between you and the hole," he told the official tournament website.

"It's very tough to hit them to a foot or two, so that's why I think there will be plenty of tricky putts that you have to save for par," he added.

Kaymer is a big supporter of the only major outside of the United States, saying it was his "favorite" tournament of the year.

"It's a fantastic major and is so different than all the other tournaments and that makes it very special and new.

"You have to be creative and you have to think a lot and mentally it's very tiring. That's what I like about it. It's not normal. You have to play different golf."

Looking at the other contenders for the title, Kaymer made a point of singling out U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy and admitted he watched on in admiration as the Northern Irishman dominated the field at Congressional.

"The way he played made me feel like I need to practice more. I need to hit more balls, need to become a better player because he played that golf course almost in a perfect way." he said.

Kaymer is paired with defending champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa and American star Phil Mickelson for the first two rounds.
