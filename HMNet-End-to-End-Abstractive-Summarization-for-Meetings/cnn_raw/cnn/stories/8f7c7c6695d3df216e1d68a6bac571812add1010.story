LONDON, England (CNN) -- Oasis front man Noel Gallagher has quit the rock group after a fallout with his bandmate brother, he announced late Friday.

"It's with some sadness and great relief to tell you that I quit Oasis tonight," Noel Gallagher said in a brief statement on the band's Web site. "People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer."

Noel Gallagher is the band's lead guitarist and songwriter, and Liam Gallagher is the lead singer.

The band is currently on a European tour for its album, "Dig Out Your Soul." Noel Gallagher apologized to fans who had bought tickets for upcoming gigs in France, Germany and Italy.

Oasis had to cancel its headlining performance at the V Festival in Britain over the weekend because Liam Gallagher said he was sick and couldn't sing.

He later apologized for the cancellation and quashed rumors that it was the band's last-ever British gig.

Disputes between the brothers have been in the public eye in the past, but never before has one of the brothers gone so far as to leave the band.

Oasis shot to stardom with its 1994 album, "Definitely Maybe," which contained the band's first major hit, "Supersonic."

The follow-up, "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?" produced one of group's most famous tracks, "Wonderwall."

The Manchester band was one of the pioneers of the Britpop movement of the early '90s, along with British band Blur.
