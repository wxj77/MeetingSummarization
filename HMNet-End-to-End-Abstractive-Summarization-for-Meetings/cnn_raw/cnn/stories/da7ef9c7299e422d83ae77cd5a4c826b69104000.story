(CNN Student News) -- April 23, 2014

This Wednesday, we cover subjects related to civics, science and animal behavior. Our first two reports center on Supreme Court cases, and our third examines the challenges still facing search crews more than a month after a massive landslide in Washington state. We also explore the lingering effects of a 2010 oil spill and show you how some people are recovering from that.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.
