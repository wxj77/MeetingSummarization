Washington (CNN) -- The Military Religious Freedom Foundation is fighting fire with new Qurans.

The group, which is dedicated to protecting U.S. troops from religious intolerance in the military, is promising to buy one new Quran and donate it to the Afghan National Army for each Quran burned by a Florida minister this weekend.

Mikey Weinstein said more than 100 of the active duty troops that he represents have called him wanting to do something about the threat by Pastor Terry Jones to burn at least 200 Qurans on the anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks.

Weinstein told CNN his group will buy new Qurans and send to them Gen. David Patraeus, the commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, so the general can give them to the Afghan National Army.

The troops who support Weinstein's move want to be able to tell Afghan elders who are concerned about Quran burning that there is a group in the United States that feels differently.
