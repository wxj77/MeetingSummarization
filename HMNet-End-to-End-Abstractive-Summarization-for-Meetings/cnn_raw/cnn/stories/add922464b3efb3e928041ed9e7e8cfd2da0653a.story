Snooki began her new reality series -- motherhood -- early Sunday, giving birth to a healthy baby boy, according to her representative.

Within hours of the baby's arrival, the 24-year-old "Jersey Shore" star tweeted about her joy:  "I am SO IN LOVE with my son Lorenzo Dominic ! I had my little man last night, healthy at 6lbs! HE'S MY WORLD!"

Snooki -- whose real name is Nicole Polizzi -- revealed in March that she was pregnant and engaged to the baby's father, Jionni LaValle.  She said she would marry her longtime boyfriend, but that's still pending.

Confirmation of the early morning delivery came in a statement from rep Stacey Wechsler:

"The world just got another Guido!!!  Lorenzo Dominic LaValle has entered the world weighing 6lbs, 5oz. Nicole, Jionni & Enzo are doing great!"

Wechsler pointed CNN to MTV's website for more details, including that the birth happened at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey, at 3 a.m. Sunday.

Fans who want to know about the last months of Snooki's pregnancy can tune in to the next season of MTV's "Jersey Shore," which the channel said will debut in October.

Snooki, one of TV's highest paid reality stars, shared much of the early months of the pregnancy with the curious world on her MTV spinoff, "Snooki & JWoww."
