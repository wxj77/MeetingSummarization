(CNN) -- A car bomb detonated on a busy street in southeastern Baghdad on Wednesday night, killing 14 people and wounding 51 others, authorities said.

Several shops and vehicles nearby were damaged in the explosion in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood known as New Baghdad.

In a separate incident Wednesday night, three mortar rounds landed inside the heavily fortified Green Zone in central Baghdad, Iraq's interior ministry said.

It's unclear whether there were any casualties.

The Green Zone houses Iraqi government offices, as well as the U.S. and British embassies.
