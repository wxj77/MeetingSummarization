(CNN) -- At least 12 people, mostly women, were killed and 47 others were wounded in Somalia's capital city, Mogadishu, after Islamists and African Union forces exchanged shells Thursday, an ambulance service official said.

"I can confirm that at least 12 people died in today's fighting and we have collected 47 others who got wounded," said Ali Musa, director of an ambulance service who spoke to CNN from Mogadishu. "At one site, a shell landed on women selling milk and a number of them got killed and wounded."

The exchange of shells continued until 3:20 in the afternoon, Musa said.
