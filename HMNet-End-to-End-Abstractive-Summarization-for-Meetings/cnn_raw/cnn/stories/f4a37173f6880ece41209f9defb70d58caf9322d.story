(CNN) -- It's the end of an era at New York radio station Hot 97.

The hip-hop and R&B station is losing one of its major talents, Angie Martinez, who has abruptly jumped ship to rival station Power 105, the Washington Post reports.

Martinez, who had been with Hot 97 for more than 20 years and is a favorite of hip-hop fans and performers alike, posted about her departure on social media.

"Today I resigned from HOT97," she posted. "I am grateful to the Emmis family for my time with the company and the immeasurable way that it has shaped my life. We made history together in so many ways and I will cherish those memories and my friendships forever."

Calling it "one of the toughest decisions I've ever had to make," Martinez went on to thank her fan base.

"Thank you HOT97 and most importantly....the listeners... for an unimaginable journey," she wrote.

Very quickly, the morning crew from Power 105 tweeted, welcoming Martinez aboard.

"Welcome @angiemartinez the 'Voice of New York' to @Power1051 !," they wrote.

The two stations have been rivals for years. Martinez will reportedly also be heard on The Beat in Miami.
