(CNN) -- Rapper Gucci Mane made his first court appearance Wednesday on charges of aggravated assault and aggravated battery in connection with an alleged attack at an Atlanta night club, the Fulton County Sheriff's Office said.

Mane, whose real name is Radric Davis, was denied bond, authorities said, and he will remain in the Fulton County Jail until April 10.

The performer turned himself in to authorities Tuesday night after police issued a warrant for his arrest.

Mane, 33, is accused of hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at Atlanta's Harlem Nights Ultra Lounge club. The man told police the incident occurred after he tried to strike up a conversation with the rapper.

"I'm in the military. I wanted to get a picture with Gucci Mane," he told CNN affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta. "I was speaking to the security guard, and Gucci Mane hit me in the head with a bottle."

According to police, the man was left with "a deep gash" on his head after the reported incident.

CNN's Breeanna Hare and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.
