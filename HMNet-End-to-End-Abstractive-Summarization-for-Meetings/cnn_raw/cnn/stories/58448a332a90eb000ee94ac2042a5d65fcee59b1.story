(CNN) -- Formula One teams are planning an innovative joint launch ahead of the 2010 season.

In a further effort to cut costs, the move will see all 13 teams on show in a special event in Valencia at the end of January.

In the past, teams have either held their own special launches at their factories, or revealed their cars at one of the pre-season tests.

Mercedes-Benz GP chief executive Nick Fry outlined the initiative at the Motor Sport Business Forum in Monaco.

"I don't want to go into too much detail about what the plans actually are, but we have agreed between all the teams to do a joint launch and we do wish to turn it into a proper event," Fry told reporters.

"We are getting a lot of help from the venue and investment in communication and marketing to do that. I wouldn't wish to spill the beans on what we are going to do, but it is going to be hugely new and innovative.

"It is going to be a clear demonstration of how we are going to be working together. We are not all going off and doing our own individual launches, so we can do something that is a lot more customer friendly."

It is understood the new teams -- Virgin Racing, US F1, Lotus and Campos -- may struggle to have their cars ready by then, but they would certainly be present at the event.
