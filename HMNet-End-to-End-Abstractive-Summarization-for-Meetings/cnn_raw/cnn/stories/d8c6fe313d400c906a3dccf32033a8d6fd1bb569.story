(CNN) -- London's Metropolitan Police confirmed that officers from the police's Counter Terrorism Command, SO15, have arrested a 19-year-old man on suspicion of preparing for acts of terrorism.

Though they are not yet releasing details on the charges or the man's name, Scotland Yard said the man was arrested at London's Heathrow Airport on Saturday and remains in custody at a police station in South London.

Scotland Yard also said the arrest is not in response to any immediate risk or threat. Police have searched an address in Camden, a northern borough of London, though no information is being released on that search at this point.
