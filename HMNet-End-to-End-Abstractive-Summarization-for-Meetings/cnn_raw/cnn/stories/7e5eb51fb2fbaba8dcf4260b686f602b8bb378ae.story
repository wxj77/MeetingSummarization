Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- The effort to rescue hundreds of trekkers stranded for six days in a town near Nepal's iconic Mount Everest due to bad weather continued Monday.

With weather conditions improving Monday, the process of transporting the tourists to the nation's capital was fully under way, the tourism ministry said.

"The target is to transport 1,500 tourists to Kathmandu today," Hari Basyal, spokesman of the Nepal Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation told CNN.

More than 2,200 tourists have been stranded in the village of Lukla since last week where food supplies are limited, Basyal said.

Lukla, a popular starting point for people on their way to the world's tallest peak, is located in northeast Nepal.

Stranded tourists took 48 flights and helicopter rides out of Lukla on Monday. A day earlier, at least 500 trekkers were flown to the capital.

Last week, some of the tourists began a four-day walk to the town of Jiri to take buses to Kathmandu.
