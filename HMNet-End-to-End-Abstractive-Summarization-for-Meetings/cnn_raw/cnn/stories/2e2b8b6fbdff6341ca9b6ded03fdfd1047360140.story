WASHINGTON (CNN) -- One of the women who tried to assassinate President Ford 32 years ago was released on parole Monday from a federal prison in California, according to a Bureau of Prisons spokesman.

Sara Jane Moore, 77, was released in the morning from the federal women's prison in Dublin, outside San Francisco, according to Mike Truman of the Bureau of Prisons.

There was no immediate comment from the prison facility, where Moore had been Inmate No. 04851180. Officials said she had a recent parole hearing, but they did not know what prompted her release.

Nor was it clear what her plans are or where she is headed.

The former nurse and mother of five had been trying for 20 years to gain her freedom.

Moore was arrested in September 22, 1975, outside the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco after firing a single shot at  Ford. A bystander had grabbed Moore's arms just before she fired a .38 caliber revolver and was credited with probably saving the president's life. The bullet missed Ford's head by inches.

Seventeen days earlier Ford survived another attempt on his life by Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, in Sacramento, California.

Moore pleaded guilty to attempted assassination and was sentenced to life in prison. At the time she had been married and divorced seven times.

In recent interviews Moore said she regretted her actions, which she said were motivated by radical revolutionary politics.

As an inmate she worked as an accountant in the prison drapery factory.
