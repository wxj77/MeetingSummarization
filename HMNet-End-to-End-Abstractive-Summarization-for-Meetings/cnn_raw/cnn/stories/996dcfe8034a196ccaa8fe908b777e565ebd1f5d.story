(CNN) -- BMW Oracle have taken a 1-0 lead in the best-of-three America's Cup after a comfortable victory over holders Alinghi in Friday's opening race in Valencia.

American challengers Oracle cruised home by a three kilometer margin despite a poor start -- and now look poised to take the title from their Swiss opponents in the second race on Sunday.

The opening race had twice fallen victim to adverse weather conditions this week, and more rough weather delayed proceedings once again.

But when the flag eventually came down, Oracle stormed to victory, coming home over 15 minutes ahead of Alinghi.

Winning captain James Spithill told the official America's Cup Web site: "This was one of the hardest days I've had on the boat with the pressure and direction changes.

"But all in all it was a good day. I'm sure there are some improvements we can make, but obviously it was great."

The America's Cup is international sport's oldest trophy and was first competed for off the coast of southern England in 1851.
