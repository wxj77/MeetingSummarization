(EW.com) -- Right in the midst of Monday night's Emmy pandemonium, 20th Century Fox dropped a new TV teaser for "Gone Girl," David Fincher's upcoming adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel.

Much of the footageâ€”depicting Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck's perfect marriage gone awry and the media circus that follows after her character goes missingâ€”was recycled from previous clips.

But here, we also get a glimpse at their first encounter, in which Affleck's Nick Dunne says, sorta creepily, "I'm the guy to save you... from all this awesomeness."
