(CNN) -- Why should we care about what Sinead O'Connor says to Miley Cyrus? When a 1990s hitmaker tells a former Disney Channel darling to stop "pimping" herself (or allowing herself to be pimped), does that have any bearing on our lives?

That's what we were wondering after we read O'Connor's open letter to Cyrus, in which O'Connor cautioned the 20-year-old singer that "nothing but harm will come in the long run, from allowing yourself to be exploited." Naturally, as one does in this day and age, we took to Twitter to find out, by asking prominent feminists and media critics Soraya Chemaly, Gloria Feldt, Jaclyn Friedman, Erin Matson and Jennifer Pozner what they thought of the letter.

We got some pretty interesting responses, and we'd like to continue the conversation. Check out this sampling of their responses and let us know what you think in the comments or on Facebook.
