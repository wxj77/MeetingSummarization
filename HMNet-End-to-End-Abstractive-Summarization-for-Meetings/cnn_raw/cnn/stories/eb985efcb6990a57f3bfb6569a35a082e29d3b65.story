(CNN) -- If ever there was an appropriate prize for a hole in one, the organizers of the Portugal Masters certainly found it when fun-loving Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez struck it lucky on the eighth at the Oceanico Victoria Course on the Algarve.

The Ryder Cup star's seven iron approach to the 168-yard hole proved perfect -- and his reward? -- 100 bottles of red wine to restock his cellar.

The 49-year-old Jimenez is known for his trademark cigars and a love of the grape as well as his outstanding play and was immediately presented with a bottle from his considerable haul by sponsors, the cheekily named SEXY wines, after his round.

Jimenez came close to extending his own record as the oldest European Tour winner when beaten in a playoff for the Dutch Open by home player Joost Luiten last month but has been off the pace in his latest event.

One of the early morning starters in the final round, Jimenez eventually carded a one-under-par 70 for five under 279, some way off the pace in the $2.71 million tournament.

He has made a fine recovery from breaking his leg in a skiing accident last winter and currently lies 17th in the Race to Dubai standings with nearly a million dollars in prize money to his name.

Jimenez's early heroics proved the perfect backdrop for a battle royale for the honors in Portugal.

Scott Jamieson, who shot a brilliant 60 in the third round, saw his chances disappear after a disappointing back nine, as did overnight leader Paul Waring.

It left the way clear for England's David Lynn to claim the title after an eight-under-par 63 left him one shot clear on 18-under 266.

South African Justin Walters was an emotional second just two weeks after his mother passed away, finishing with a lengthy birdie putt on the testing 18th to seal the runner-up spot.
