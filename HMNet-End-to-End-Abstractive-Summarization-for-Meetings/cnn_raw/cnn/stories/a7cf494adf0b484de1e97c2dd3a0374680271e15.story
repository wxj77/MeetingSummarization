Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was released from a Buenos Aires hospital Sunday, days after undergoing surgery there, state media reported.

Doctors operated on Fernandez on Tuesday to remove a blood clot on the surface of her brain.

"The president is in very good spirits and due to her excellent recovery she will be released from the hospital," government spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro told reporters.

The state-run Telam news agency reported that Fernandez left the hospital Sunday afternoon.

Last weekend, doctors diagnosed Fernandez, 60, with a subdural hematoma and said she needed to take a month off of work.

On Sunday, doctors said she must follow strict rest for 30 days and avoid air travel.

A subdural hematoma is a blood clot on the brain's surface beneath its outer covering, called the dura. Often, in people over 60, a brain trauma can cause the blood vessels in the brain to tear and blood to clot.

According to Argentina's constitution, the vice president assumes the presidency temporarily in the president's absence.

CNN's Jose Manuel Rodriguez reported from Buenos Aires. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.
