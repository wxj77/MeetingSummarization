(CNN Student News) -- November 12, 2013

As the Filipino president declares a "state of national calamity," CNN Student News reports on rescue and recovery efforts following a devastating typhoon. We also discuss the Washington Monument's repair status, and we see how the U.S. and other countries paid tribute to their veterans. Plus, we hear how the U.S. military plans to outfit commandos with "Iron Man" suits.
