(CNN) -- Wow! If you think NFL football is boring, you must not have been watching this weekend. The league's top teams have provided a feast of breathtaking games the past two days.

First, on Saturday, the Baltimore Ravens kept retiring linebacker Ray Lewis' career alive by stunning Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos 38-35 in double overtime. After 60 minutes of jaw-dropping kick returns and crazy-close calls, Justin Tucker sealed it with a 47-yard field goal in sudden death.

Later that day, young 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick set a rushing record and racked up 400 total yards to humble the vaunted Green Bay Packers defense in a convincing 45-31 win in San Francisco.

Then on Sunday, the Seattle Seahawks roared back from a 20-0 halftime deficit against the Falcons and went ahead 28-27 with just 31 seconds left on the clock in Atlanta.

The Falcons appeared finished, but Matt Ryan and Tony Gonzalez drove far enough after the ensuing kickoff to give Matt Bryant a shot at a 49-yard field goal with 13 seconds left. Bryant's boot was wide right, but Seattle had called a timeout just before the snap, giving the Falcons a do-over. Bryant didn't miss twice, drilling the long field goal with eight seconds remaining.

A Hail Mary pass by sensational Seahawks rookie quarterback Russell Wilson was caught in the end zone -- by sticky-handed Falcons receiver Julio Jones, who was put in on defense for just such an emergency.

Finally on Sunday night, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots manhandled the Houston Texans 41-28 in Foxboro, Massachusetts, to capture the final spot in the division championship round next weekend.
