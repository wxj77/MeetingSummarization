Leogane, Haiti (CNN)  -- More than three weeks after Haiti's devastating earthquake, many of the makeshift camps housing thousands are starting to function as mini cities.

Small markets have blossomed. Some camps have even designated mayors and security personnel.

But in others, life still looks as it did days after the January 12 quake. People have only what they dug out of the rubble with their bare hands or acquired somehow else for survival.

Recently seen along a row of tents in a camp in Leogane was this hodgepodge of life before and after:

Barbie doll

A black rhinestone Bebe T-shirt
