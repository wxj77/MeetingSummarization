(CNN) -- An album release party at a Chicago nightclub ended in gunfire, sending seven people to the hospital early Thursday morning, police said.

All seven were listed in stable condition, Chicago police spokesman Hector Alfaro said.

He said the shooting took place at an album release party for a rapper.

The night's rap concert at Mr. G's Entertainment Center featured Lil' Mouse and King Samson, the Chicago Tribune reported, citing police and a patron of the club.

A fight broke out, and three men pulled out weapons and started firing, Alfaro said.

A 19-year-old female was among the seven shot. The rest were men between ages 20 and 30, he said.

Police believe the shooting is gang related, but they don't have anyone in custody.
