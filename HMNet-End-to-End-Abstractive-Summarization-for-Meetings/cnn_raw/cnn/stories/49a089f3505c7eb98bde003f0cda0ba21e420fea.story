(CNN) -- Colombia are through to the quarterfinals of the Copa America after beating Bolivia 2-0 in Sante Fe on Sunday to finish top of Group A with seven points.

In-demand Porto striker Radamel Falcao put Colombia ahead in the 14th minute after running onto a long through-ball.

And Falcao, who is rumored to be interesting Chelsea who are now managed by his former Porto coach Andre Villas-Boas, doubled the lead by netting from the penalty spot 12 minutes later.

Has Argentine football reached crisis point?

Adrian Ramos, Freddy Guarin and Dayro Moreno all went close for Colombia in the first half, although they took their foot off the gas after the break.

The result cranks up the pressure on host nation Argentina ahead of their Group A finale against Costa Rica on Monday.

Argentina need to win that match to qualify alongside Colombia, while a draw or Costa Rica win will send them crashing out.

Bolivia's defeat means they are out of the competition after collecting just one point from their three matches.
