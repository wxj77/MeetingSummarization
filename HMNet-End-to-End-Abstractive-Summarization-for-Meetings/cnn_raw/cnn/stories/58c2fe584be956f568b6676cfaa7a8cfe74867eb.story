Marc Marquez continued to redefine sporting perfection after the Spaniard won the German MotoGP -- his ninth successive victory of the season.

Remarkably Marquez won the race from the pit lane, racing through the pack and going past early leader Stefan Bradl with 24 laps left to finish ahead of Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa, with Yamaha's Jorge Lorenzo in third.

One of 14 riders that chose slick tires at the last minute after the warm up lap, Marquez had to start from the pit lane, meaning he had to wait until the bikes on the grid and on dry tires had motored past.

"It was tough and when I saw Bradl changing tires at the beginning. I thought that was the right choice because there was only one corner that was completely wet," said defending champion Marquez.

"Everyone went in (to change tires) including my main rivals -- Dani (Pedrosa) and Valentino (Rossi).

"When I saw them go in, I followed but it worked out OK," added the Spaniard

Marquez has now won a perfect 225 points this season, 77 points ahead of compatriot Pedrosa, with Italian Valentino Rossi in third, 84 points adrift.

Rossi finished Sunday's race in fourth.
