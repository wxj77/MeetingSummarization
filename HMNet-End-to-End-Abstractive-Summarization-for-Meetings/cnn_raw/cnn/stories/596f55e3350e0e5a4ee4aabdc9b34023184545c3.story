(CNN) -- IN FOCUS: Egypt's Economic Concerns

Egypt's revolution struck a hammer blow to the nation's economy. More than a year later, the outlook is starting to look more positive with holidaymakers returning to the country. 

But some in the tourism industry remain worried. They fear the growing influence of Islamists in the government may lead to strict rules like the ban of alcohol. MME takes a closer look at Egypt's wine-making industry.
