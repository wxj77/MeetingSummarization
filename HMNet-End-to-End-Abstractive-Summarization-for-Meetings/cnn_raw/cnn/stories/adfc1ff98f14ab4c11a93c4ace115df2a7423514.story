(CNN) -- Prosecutors in Boston, Massachusetts, on Thursday filed paperwork in court that officially ended the murder case against "Craigslist killer" Philip Markoff, who committed suicide in jail last month.

The Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said prosecutors had a "very, very strong case" against Markoff, but it was short-circuited when Markoff took his own life August 15.

"What he did was abhorrent, it was disgraceful, it was brutal and he would have been held accountable," said Conley, who told reporters that the case file would be available to review in a few weeks.

Markoff, 24, was a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine when arrested in April 2009 in the killing of Julissa Brisman, 25, at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Police said that Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on the online classifieds service Craigslist, and Markoff might have met her through the site.

Authorities said Markoff killed himself in his jail cell by cutting himself multiple times with a makeshift scalpel crafted from a pen and a piece of metal. In addition, a large, clear plastic bag of a type issued to inmates was fastened around his neck with a piece of gauze.

The name of his former fiancee, who called off their wedding after his arrest, was scrawled in what appeared to be blood on the wall of his cell when he was found, Conley told reporters at the time.

Conley said the Brisman family was "robbed of the opportunity" to seek justice against Markoff.
