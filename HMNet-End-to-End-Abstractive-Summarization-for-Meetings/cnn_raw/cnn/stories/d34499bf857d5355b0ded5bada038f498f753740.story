Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki is the new women's world number one after reaching the quarterfinals of the China Open.

The 20-year-old overtook Serena Williams in the WTA world rankings following her comfortable 6-3 6-2 success over Czech Petra Kvitova on Thursday.

The top seed knew that reaching the last eight in Berlin would ensure she becomes the first Dane to top the world rankings when the new list is released on Monday.

Williams missed the tournament because of the foot injury she suffered following her fourth Wimbledon victory in July.

The victory, Wozniacki's 56th of an impressive season, means she becomes the 20th player in WTA history to hit the top spot and has been attained after tournament wins in Ponte Vedra Beach, Copenhagen, Montreal, New Haven and Tokyo.

WTA Tour chief Stacey Allaster told reporters that Wozniacki was a worthy world number one, despite never winning a grand slam title.

"There are only two players this year that have reached the fourth round of all four grand slams events -- Caroline and Venus Williams," Allaster told reporters.

"She has won more matches than any other player on tour this year and right now Caroline is the most consistent player over this 12-month period."

Wozniacki will face Ana Ivanovic in the quarterfinals after the Serb continued her recent good form with a surprise 7-6 7-6 success over seventh seed Elena Dementieva.

Meanwhile, ninth seed Li Na of China also booked her place in the last eight with a 6-2 6-0 crushing of Germany's Angelique Kerber.
