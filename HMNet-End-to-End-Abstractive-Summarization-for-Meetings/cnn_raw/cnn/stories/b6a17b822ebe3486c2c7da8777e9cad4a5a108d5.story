(CNN) -- Rescuers pulled two more bodies from the wreckage of a collapsed building Sunday in Bangladesh, bringing the death toll to 1,119, the country's state news agency reported.

While hundreds of bodies have been turned over to relatives, more than 200 have been unclaimed. The organization Anjuman-e-Mafidul Islam buried 234 unclaimed bodies at a graveyard in the capital, state news agency BSS reported. DNA samples were collected for future identification.

Many bodies are decomposed beyond recognition, the news agency reported.

The nine-story building on the outskirts of the capital city of Dhaka collapsed April 24.

On Friday, 19-year-old mother Reshma Begum was discovered alive in the rubble. Doctors said she is improving steadily.
