London (CNN) -- A 15-year-old Ethiopian boy who came to Britain to take part in the Olympic torch relay and speaks little English has gone missing, police said Friday, prompting concern for his welfare.

Natnael Yemane left his hotel in central Nottingham on Thursday night and has not been seen since, Nottinghamshire police said.

"We are concerned for Natnael as he does not speak very good English and is not thought to be street-wise," a police spokesman said.

"He does have family in London, but we need to find him and make sure he is safe and well."

Natnael, who took part in the torch relay Thursday, is described as black, 5 feet 8 inches tall, and of thin build.

He has short hair and was last seen wearing faded dark jeans, a green and yellow camouflage hooded jacket, and black sneakers with a white stripe.

A London 2012 representative said: "A young boy of 15 has gone missing, and clearly this is of great concern to us. Everyone is doing all they can to find him and make sure he is safe."

Anyone who may have seen Natnael since Thursday night is urged to contact the police.

Natnael was one of 20 young people picked for the London Olympics "International Inspiration" program, the Games organizers said.

One torchbearer was selected from each of the 20 countries that are part of the program, from Azerbaijan to Zambia.

International Inspiration, part of the "legacy" program of the London 2012 Olympics, "inspires and enables millions of young people in countries around the world to play sport," according to the official website.

Over the course of the 70-day relay, leading up to the July 27 opening ceremony, 8,000 runners will carry the Olympic flame 8,000 miles across the United Kingdom. Organizers say the flame will pass within 10 miles of 95% of the British population on the route.
