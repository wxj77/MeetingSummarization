(CNN) -- "Glee" will likely end its run after season 6 â€” the final year in the drama's current deal on Fox. "I would not anticipate it goes beyond two more seasons," Fox entertainment chairman Kevin Reilly told reporters on Thursday. "Never say never, but there's two very clear [story] arcs to get to that end and conclude. If we discover a new crop of kids and there's some breakout we like ... [but] right now, we're thinking two seasons."

Reilly also said the drama will address Cory Monteith's death in the third episode, during which Fox will air public service announcements about substance abuse. The fifth season premiere of Glee is set for Thursday, Sept. 26, a week later than originally scheduled.

Monteith, 31, was found found dead July 13 of an overdose.

Drugs, however, will not be the cause of death for Finn (Monteith). Reilly could not say how show creator Ryan Murphy will deal with the character's passing since the script has yet to be completed. The PSAs will address drug abuse and how it's short-sighted to assume addicts only look or behave in certain ways.

"When you see some people struggle with addiction, they are easily put in a category. 'He was dark, she was always a partier,'" Reilly said at the Television Critics Tour in Los Angeles. "Cory was a big open life force. He was not a problem, he looked straight as an arrow. He was open about his addiction in the past, just not as open about it in the present. Everybody was shocked, but this was an accident. It happened to someone struggling with addiction."

Reilly also said proceeds from the music sold from the episode will go to Monteith's family.
