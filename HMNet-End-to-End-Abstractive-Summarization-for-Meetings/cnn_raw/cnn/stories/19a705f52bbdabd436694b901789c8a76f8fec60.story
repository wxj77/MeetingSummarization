A massive typhoon bears down on the Philippines, a popular social media service launches its IPO, and the U.S. FDA considers a policy shift on trans fats. CNN Student News offers up details on these stories. Then, we follow an Olympic torch's journey into space, and we discuss how gold grows on some trees. Plus, we reflect on the legacy of an iconic sports stadium.
