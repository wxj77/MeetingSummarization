Nadal told reporters: "It was a very emotional match and I am happy for the team.

"It was the most amazing atmosphere I have ever played in. The crowd were crazy. and everything was perfect for us," he continued.

"It was complicated at the start of the match, but the beginning of the second set was very important and at 1-0 and 40-0 that was the turning point for me."

Spanish captain Albert Costa added: "It was an unbelievable match. These guys are great and that's why we were in the final.

"Rafa tried to play deeper and harder because at the start Del Potro was inside the line and hitting so hard. He fought hard so that's why we won."
