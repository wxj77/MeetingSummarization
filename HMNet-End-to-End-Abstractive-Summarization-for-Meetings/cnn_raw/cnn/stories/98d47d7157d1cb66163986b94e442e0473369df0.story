(CNN) -- Election night tops off an important day that, for many people, can be summed up in one tiny sticker that says "I voted."

We asked readers to upload their photos to CNN iReport and tag their social media images of stickers #ivotedcnn, and we received more than 2,000 iReport submissions from all 50 states. (That's not including all of the photos tagged #ivotedcnn.)

You can view the iReports on a map via the Open Story.

But early voting has been especially big in 2012, and some polling places don't give away stickers. Sticker-less iReporters printed out CNN's sticker or found other ways to tell us that they had voted. Just take a look here to see a few creative examples.
