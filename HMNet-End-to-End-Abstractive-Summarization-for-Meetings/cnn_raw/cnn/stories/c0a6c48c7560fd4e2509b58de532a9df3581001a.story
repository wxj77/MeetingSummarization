(CNN) -- Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini has confirmed that winger Cristiano Ronaldo has been ruled out of his side's La Liga clash with Sevilla on Sunday with an ankle injury.

Real Madrid winger Cristiano Ronaldo will miss his side's La Liga clash with Sevilla with an ankle injury.

The 24-year-old Portugal international picked up the injury in Real's 3-0 victory over Marseille in the Champions League during the week having scored twice in the game.

Ronaldo was keen to be involved in the clash at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan stadium, but Pellegrini revealed the club's medical staff have taken the decision to leave him out of the squad.

"The only issue was Cristiano Ronaldo's ankle. He tried playing yesterday and today and everyone, including the medical staff, believes he isn't ready to play," Pellegrini told the club's Web site.

"He trained on his own but wasn't able to recover and will therefore not play tomorrow.

"Cristiano's absence is significant, but we have a good squad and sufficient alternatives."

The match will be the first competitive game Ronaldo has missed a since his arrival from Manchester United for $130 million having contributed nine goals in seven games so far this season.

The injury is not thought to be serious and he should be involved in Portugal's World Cup qualifying clash against Hungary next weekend.

Pellegrini also left midfielders Lassana Diarra and Fernando Gago, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and defender Alvaro Arbeloa out of the squad for the trip to Sevilla.
