(CNN) -- Brazil's men's football team are one win away from an historic first Olympic title after a 3-0 defeat of South Korea in Tuesday's semifinal at London 2012.

The five-time world champions, who have also won the South American championship on eight occasions, will play Mexico at Wembley Stadium on Saturday in the gold medal match.

A brace from striker Leandro Damiao, his fifth and sixth goals of the tournament, followed a first-half effort from defensive midfielder Romulo as Brazil proved too much for spirited South Korea.

Mexico booked a place in the weekend showpiece courtesy of a similarly comfortable 3-1 win over Japan, who will contest the bronze medal against their Asian rivals in Cardiff on Friday.

After a bright opening from South Korea, bidding for a first Olympic football medal, Brazil took control and Romulo gave Mano Menezes' team the lead after 38 minutes with a calm sidefoot finish.

The Koreans were furious when a penalty was not awarded for Sandro's trip on Kim Bokyoung early in the second half, then Damiao took control of the contest.

After doubling Brazil's lead on 57 minutes, the Internacional star made the result safe with a smart prodded finish seven minutes later.

Earlier in the day, Mexico, also looking for a first Games medal, had to come from behind after 12 minutes when Yuki Otsu gave Japan the lead.

Marco Fabian leveled with 30 minutes played, before Oribe Peralta found the net to give Mexico a 2-1 lead just after the hour mark.

As Japan poured forward looking for an equalizer, Javier Cortes broke free in the final seconds to seal victory.
