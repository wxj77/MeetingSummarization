(Rolling Stone) -- ABBA have announced plans to reissue their final album, "The Visitors," with a previously unreleased song on April 23.

"From a Twinkling Star to a Passing Angel," a demo recorded around the time "The Visitors" was released in 1981, will be the first new ABBA recording released since the box set "Thank You for the Music" was issued in 1994.

The new version of "The Visitors" will also include six previously released bonus tracks and a DVD featuring rare and unreleased footage from the Swedish pop band's archives, including their last-ever live performance on the BBC's "Late Late Breakfast Show" in December of 1982.

ABBA disbanded in 1982 and have since refused to reunite. The band even declined to get back together for their induction in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.
