Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor and rapper LL Cool J "physically detained" an alleged burglar he caught in his Los Angeles home early Wednesday, police said.

The man tripped his home security alarm at 1 a.m., sending him into action, according to a Los Angeles Police statement.

After catching the man, he held him until police arrived, police said.

The man, whose name was not released, was booked into jail, police said. The police statement did not detail what charges he faces.

"LL Cool J, and his family, are safe and thank everyone for their thoughts and concern," his representative said in a statement to CNN. "As a father, husband and citizen, he is committed to keeping his family safe and is cooperating with authorities on this private matter."

LL Cool J, whose real name is James Todd Smith, plays Special Agent Sam Hanna on "NCIS: Los Angeles," a CBS crime series.

CNN's Denise Quan and Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.
