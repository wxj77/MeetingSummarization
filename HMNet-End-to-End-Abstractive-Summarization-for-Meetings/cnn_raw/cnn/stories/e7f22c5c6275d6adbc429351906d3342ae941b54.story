(CNN) -- Newly-promoted St Pauli moved up to sixth in the German Bundesliga table after a surprise 1-0 victory away at high-flying Hannover 96.

Marius Ebbers scored what proved to be the only goal of the game with a header from Bastian Oczipka's cross after six minutes.

Hanover dominated the remainder of the match, but could not break down the compact St Pauli defense.

And the home side's frustration boiled over 10 minutes from time when Karim Haggui was sent off for a professional foul on Mathias Lehman.

'Carnival Club' on verge of history

A victory for Hannover would have taken them above Borussia Dortmund into second in the table.

Hamburg-based St Pauli are competing in the Bundesliga for the first time since 2002, when they were relegated after only winning four games all season.

League leaders Mainz 05 are looking for a seventh win of the season in a top-of-the-table clash at home against fourth-placed Hoffenheim on Saturday.

Defending champions Bayern Munich travel to Dortmund on Sunday.
