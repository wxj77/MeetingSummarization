(CNN Student News) -- April 9, 2014

This Wednesday, CNN Student News discusses the issue of equal pay, and we dive into the rugged topography of the ocean floor. Less than two weeks before the 2014 Boston Marathon, we report on how a victim of last year's terrorist bombings has recovered with the support of her city. We also explore how electrical stimulation is helping people who are paralyzed. And we just can't put off a report about how procrastination may be in people's genes!

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.
