(CNN) -- Venus Williams is through to the final of the Madrid Open, where she will face Frenchwoman Aravane Rezai, after crushing Shahar Peer in straight sets on Saturday.

The American, who will move up to number two in the world on Monday, behind her younger sister Serena, eased past Israeli Peer 6-3 6-0 to remain on course for her 44th career title.

The victory also maintained Venus' impressive form this year, with Madrid becoming her fourth final appearance in just six events.

Looking ahead to the French Open, a tournament she has never won, Venus told the official WTA Tour Web site:  "I feel like I've had a good career on clay courts.

"Ultimately the goal is to win the French -- I've come close. I'd like to take it one more step. But my mindset right now is just on this tournament," added the 29-year-old.

Unseeded Rezai was handed an even easier passage to the final after opponent Lucie Safarova was forced to withdraw from the other semifinal through injury, after losing the opening set 6-1.
