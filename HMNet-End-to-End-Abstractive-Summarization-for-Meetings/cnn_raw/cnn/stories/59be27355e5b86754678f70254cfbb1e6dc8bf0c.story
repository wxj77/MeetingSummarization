(CNN) -- New Zealand police are investigating a "serious allegation" against four England rugby internationals following an alleged incident at their team hotel in Auckland.

The England team are currently involved in a two match tour to New Zealand.

Although Auckland police have yet to confirm the nature of the allegation, the Press Association reports that an incident is said to have taken place early Sunday in a private hotel room at the city's Hilton hotel following the team's defeat to New Zealand's All Blacks.

In a statement the police said: "Auckland City Criminal Investigation Branch is investigating an allegation involving up to four members of the England rugby team.

"The incident being investigated is alleged to have occurred early on Sunday, June 15, in a private room. Whilst an allegation was brought to the attention of police on Sunday evening, no formal complaint has been received.

"Investigating officers are receiving the appropriate level of co-operation from the England rugby team management."

The Rugby Football Union (RFU) confirmed it was fully co-operating with the authorities over the matter.

Rob Andrew, the RFU's elite director of rugby, said in a statement: "The England rugby team has been informed by Auckland Police that an allegation has been made against four members of the England playing squad.

"Whilst no formal complaint has been made we are co-operating with the police and their enquiries.

"The players concerned have the complete support of all the players and the management. In the circumstances we are unable to make any further comment."

The identity of the players has not been revealed.

The England team is currently in Christchurch preparing for the second test against the All Blacks on Saturday.
