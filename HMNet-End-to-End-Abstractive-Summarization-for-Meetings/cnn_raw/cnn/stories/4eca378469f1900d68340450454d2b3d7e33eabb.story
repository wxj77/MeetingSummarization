(CNN)Who knew Jimmy Fallon went to Bayside High?

"The Tonight Show" host reunited some members of the cast of the hit series "Saved by the Bell" on Wednesday night in a skit that had him attending the fictional school along with Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) and the gang.

Fallon hung out in the hall with "classmates" Morris, Kelly Kapowski (a pregnant Tiffani Thiessen), A.C. Slater (Mario Lopez) and Jessie Spano (Elizabeth Berkley) and administrator Mr. Belding (Dennis Haskins).

There were plenty of inside jokes about Jessie becoming a stripper (Berkley famously took it off in the film "Showgirls") and Zack and Kelly moving to Beverly Hills (Thiessen had a role on the TV series "Beverly Hills 90210").

Berkley, as Jessie, even relived her famous "I'm so excited" moment from the show.

Lopez was so thrilled, he posted a picture of himself and Gosselaar in character on his Instagram account.

The show aired its last episode in 1993, but diehard fans are still obsessed with it. The skit was part of a week of "The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon" filming in Los Angeles.

Wednesday proved to be a bonanza for TV nostalgia lovers, as actress Jackee Harry shared a photo of herself with castmates from "227."

The actress is pictured with costars Hal Williams, Marla Gibbs and Regina King. There are big smiles and the caption, "With your family around you there's no need to roam.. Yes, I STILL love my #227 family!"

"227" ran from 1985 to 1990.
