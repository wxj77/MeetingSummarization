Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities said Tuesday they have arrested Jose Jorge Balderas, a suspect in last year's shooting of a Paraguayan soccer player in Mexico.

Salvador Cabanas was shot in the head at a bar in late January 2010. He survived.

According to police, Cabanas and Balderas had been arguing before the attack.

Balderas, 34, was arrested in a wealthy neighborhood of Mexico City, Federal Police Section Chief Ramon Eduardo Pequeno told reporters.

Balderas also is accused of having ties to Edgar Valdez Villarreal -- alias "La Barbie" -- an alleged U.S.-born drug kingpin arrested last year.

Pequeno said Balderas told authorities he did not fire the shot that hit Cabanas. The suspect blamed the shooting on an accomplice, Francisco Jose Barreto.

Authorities arrested Barreto in June.
