Actor Thomas Guiry allegedly head-butted a police officer after he was told he was too drunk to board a flight at Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport last weekend, police said Wednesday.

Guiry, 31, faces a felony charge of assault against a public servant in the Saturday incident, according to Houston Police spokesman John Cannon.

United Airlines employees called police after they refused to let Guiry board Saturday, Cannon said.

The airline workers determined he was too intoxicated to board the flight, but they wanted a police supervisor to decide if he was a candidate for a sobering center instead of being jailed for public intoxication, he said.

Guiry became agitated and made repeated threats to the police sergeant after he was told he could go to the sobering center if he was compliant, Cannon said.

After the threats, the officer told the actor he was under arrest, he said.  Guiry allegedly tried to kick the sergeant in the face as he was placing him under arrest.

The head-butting happened as the sergeant tried to restrain him, Cannon said.

Guiry was 11 when he made his acting debut in the film "The Sandlot." His career as a child actor also included the lead role in a "Lassie" movie remake in 1994 and "The Last Home Run" in 1996.  He's acted in several television series in recent years, including a recent episode of "Elementary."
