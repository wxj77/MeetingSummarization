(CNN) -- Rescue workers Tuesday recovered the body of a child from debris left by a landslide in China's southwestern Guizhou province, state-run media reported.

The child's body was the first to be recovered after a rain-triggered landslide buried 107 people from 38 families Monday afternoon. The child, yet to be identified, was found at 5:50 p.m. under rubble in Gangwu township, a rescue headquarters spokesman told the Xinhua news agency.

Chances of survival for the others was "slim," rescue workers said.

A survivor described the mudslide's speed, which left little time to escape.

"I called the others to flee. But it was too late. I saw some people behind me being buried," villager Cen Chaoyang told Xinhua in a telephone interview.

Rescuers had to run three miles to reach the site, which is not accessible by vehicle.

Rain and landslides continue to plague the region, Xinhua said. The tourism industry has already been affected by the severe weather. Officials have closed 35 of the top scenic spots in the region, Xinhua reported.
