(CNN) -- Security forces have arrested 11 al Qaeda suspects in the Yemeni capital, the nation's official news agency reported Thursday.

One man was killed in the operation, according to a security source cited by SABA.

Yemeni authorities have threatened punishment for people who harbor suspected terrorists. The warnings are part of a crackdown on alleged al Qaeda hideouts since the attempted bombing of an American airliner in December, according to SABA.

The suspect in the failed attack, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, spent time in Yemen and is said to have acquired the explosive device from someone in that country. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has claimed responsibility for the plot.

The Obama administration has recognized the risks posed by Yemen becoming a failed state and voiced support in its struggles against terrorism.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also has pressed Yemen to implement key reforms and shore up its faltering economy.

"Yemen's challenges are not going to be solved by military action alone," she said at a recent meeting of Western powers and Arab nations.

"Progress against violent extremists and progress toward a better future for the Yemeni people ... will also depend on fortifying development efforts."
