(CNN) -- Darren Clarke, Rory McIlroy and Charl Schwartzel will start the PGA Championship together, as the tradition of grouping the sport's previous three major winners continues at the Atlanta Athletic Club.

Clarke, the winner of July's British Open, and fellow Northern Irishman McIlroy, who claimed the U.S. Open, will tee off with Masters champion Schwartzel for the final golf major of the year -- which is set to begin on Thursday.

All three men are currently managed by retired former British golfer Andrew "Chubby" Chandler and will get their campaigns underway at 13.45pm local time.

World number one Luke Donald, bidding to clinch his first major championship, will play alongside Spaniard Alvaro Quiros and American Nick Watney.

The 2010 winner Martin Kaymer, from Germany, will complete the first two rounds with South Korea's Y.E. Yang and Shaun Micheel of the United States.

Tiger Woods, a 14-time major champion, will attempt to reverse a run of poor form which has seen him slide to 30th in the world when the 35-year-old starts his challenge alongside previous winners Davis Love III (1997) and Padraig Harrington (2008).

Former world number one, and current number two, Lee Westwood will also be in search of his maiden major win, and the Briton will play with world number 11 Matt Kuchar and Australia's Jason Day.

Graeme McDowell, the 2010 U.S. Open winner will begin the first two rounds with 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson and Australian Geoff Oglivy -- who was claimed the U.S. Open in 2006.

The 93rd PGA Championship will begin on Thursday, with the champion being crowned on Sunday.
