Farnborough, England (CNN) -- The Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 jet engine can spin at 1,200 miles per hour and deliver a mighty 75,000 pounds of thrust -- unless it's made of Lego bricks.

A version of the British manufacturer's most up-to-date aircraft engine made up of more than 152,000 toy bricks was among the more unusual displays at this year's Farnborough Air Show in the UK.

The half-scale model, complete with spinning Lego turbines, took specialist company BrightBricks eight weeks to construct and is made up entirely of standard Lego parts.

Rolls-Royce apprentices advised on the design of the Lego version of the engine to ensure it was as accurate as possible.

The real Trent 1000,Â  which is made from 30,000 components and weighs 5,800 kilograms, is currently being fitted onto Boeing's new 787 Dreamliners.

It is hoped the model will encourage young people visiting the show to consider careers in engineering. Or perhaps Lego.

Paul Stein, Rolls-Royce's chief scientific officer said: "What we do is exciting and we hope that this representation of our technology will help to enthuse and inspire the potential scientists and engineers of the future about the career opportunities they could pursue."

Not everyone is convinced however. One Rolls-Royce representative quipped: "Some people clearly have a lot of time on their hands."
