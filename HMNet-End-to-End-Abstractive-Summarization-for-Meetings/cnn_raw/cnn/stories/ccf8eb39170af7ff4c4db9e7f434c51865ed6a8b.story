It's no secret nowadays that some fashion bloggers wield just as much influence as magazine editors in shaping trends and sharing the latest news and images from the runways.

Still, it takes more than a pretty face and fancy photography to make a blogger rise above the rest.

"Bloggers that have a particular angle with their content have a definite advantage over others," said Jennine Jacob, founder of Independent Fashion Bloggers, an online community where fashion bloggers share resources and build their brands.

"With the ones that stand out, when you read their blog you don't just see pretty pictures. You walk away with something."

It's what distinguishes hobbyists from professional bloggers, many of whom put in 10 hours a day to run their sites as full-time jobs and prefer titles such as editor, style expert or influencer.

Some have agents or publicists, business plans, endorsements and licensing agreements with other brands. Some operate on a shoestring budget as they search for ways to monetize their sites. Many attend summits and conferences, such as the annual Independent Fashion Bloggers Conference in New York during Fashion Week, which wrapped last week, to learn how to grow their brands.
