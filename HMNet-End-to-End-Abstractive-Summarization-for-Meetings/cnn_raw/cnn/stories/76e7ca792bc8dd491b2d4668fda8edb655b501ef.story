Washington (CNN) -- Republican Gov. Scott Walker's chances of winning a second term in Wisconsin are up to 83% -- from 70% yesterday -- according to prognosticators on CNN's election prediction game Pivit.

The percentages aren't scientific -- they're based on a combination of Pivit experts' analysis of public polling and other race data and players' predictions.

The game's closest race on Saturday was one between Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Charlie Crist for the Florida governor's office. Scott is currently at 51%.

Players are high on Republicans' chances of winning the six seats they need to take control of the Senate, putting the chances of that happening at 86% -- up three percentage points from Friday night.

But they're also confident that two embattled Democratic senators will win re-election. North Carolina's Kay Hagan is up to 70%, while New Hampshire's Jeanne Shaheen is at 85%.

Republicans are getting good news in Iowa, where their candidate, Joni Ernst, is at 73% -- as well as in Kentucky, where at 94% Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell currently looks like Pivit's surest thing.

Democrats, meanwhile, are suffering in Colorado, where Pivit players give Sen. Mark Udall only a 7% chance at winning re-election, and in Arkansas, where Sen. Mark Pryor is at just 5%.
