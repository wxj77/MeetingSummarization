(Mashable) -- Twitter ran on Sunday its first-ever TV spot during the broadcast of the 2012 Pocono 400 NASCAR race.

Omid Ashtari of Twitter sent a tweet informing the community to check out the social networking site's first commercial spot.

The 16-second clip features NASCAR racer Brad Keselowski seated in his car and taking a picture of the scene with his iPhone. Keselowski, who came in 24th place during the race, is taking advantage of the iPhone's capability to upload pictures directly to Twitter. He is an active user of the site.

Keselowski made headlines in February when he tweeted updates and pictures following an explosion and fire on a NASCAR track that delayed the Daytona 500. His documentation of the event earned him more than 100,000 followers in under two hours.

What's especially interesting about the TV commercial is how Twitter plugged the NASCAR hashtag at the end of the TV spot. Instead of the typical Twitter.com/NASCAR address we would typically see, it included a hash sign: Twitter.com/#Nascar.

This is the start of Twitter's promotion of its new hashtag pages:

"The updated Twitter for Facebook integration now includes additional rich media experiences related to the first photo, URL, @mention or #hashtag in the cross-posted tweet," Twitter spokesman Robert Weeks told Mashable last week. "This update is available for everyone."

Twitter's Help Center also notes the changes: "We have fixed many issues with the Twitter for Facebook integration, including the ability to post to Facebook Pages, and added some new features!"
