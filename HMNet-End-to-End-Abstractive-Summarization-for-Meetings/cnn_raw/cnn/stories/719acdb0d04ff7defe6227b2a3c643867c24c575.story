(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic had luck on their side Friday at the Miami Masters. The fans there were less fortunate.

The top two in the world will meet in a dream Sunday final -- after both of their semifinal opponents pulled out pre match.

For the second time during the tournament, world No. 2 Djokovic didn't need to hit a ball to advance in the draw.

His third-round opponent, Florian Mayer, was a walkover because of a groin injury and the Serb progressed Friday after Kei Nishikori withdrew -- with a groin injury.

Former Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych was then unable to take on Nadal in the second semifinal due to a stomach illness, leaving spectators with no singles action to watch.

Nishikori had upset 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer in the quarterfinals Wednesday and 2013 Miami finalist David Ferrer in a three-hour battle a day earlier.

The hard-hitting Japanese baseliner, who trains in Florida, was bidding to reach his maiden Masters final.

"Very sorry to say that I have to pull out today," the 21st-ranked Nishikori said on his Facebook page. "Very disappointed and I am obviously very sorry for any fans that wanted to come out for this match.

"This tournament is very special to me and (I) look forward to coming back in the years to come. I will work with my medical team to be back healthy as soon as possible."

Berdych, in comments posted by the tournament on Twitter, said he woke up at 7:30 a.m. Miami time Friday with pain in his stomach.

"I am disappointed about not getting a chance to play," said Berdych.

Djokovic is one win away from doing the Indian Wells and Miami double, which would replicate his 2011 feat. Nadal, meanwhile, is aiming to capture the tournament for the first time.

Saturday's women's final features the top two in the rankings, too. World No. 1 Serena Williams -- trying for a seventh title in Miami -- plays Australian Open champion Li Na.
