(EW.com) -- And the host of this year's ESPYs is .... Drake!

The rapper/singer/actor/now-host will take the stage at the 2014 ESPYs to hand out awards for Excellence in Sports Performance. For a point of reference, last year's show was hosted by Jon Hamm.

There's no word yet on whether Drake will rap his way through the show, but we can only hope. Check out his announcement via Twitter below:

The ESPYs will air on July 16 at 9 p.m. on ESPN.
