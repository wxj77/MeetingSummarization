The convention

The 2008 Democratic National Convention is being held later in the year than any previous convention for either party not already holding the White House.

Obama's acceptance speech on Thursday at this year's convention falls on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech.

The first Democratic convention was held in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1832 at which President Andrew Jackson was nominated for a second term.

Since 1996, the Democrats have scheduled the vice president nominee's acceptance speech on Wednesday night instead of Thursday, when the presidential nominee speaks.

This Wednesday, the convention will conduct a roll call vote to officially select Obama as the presidential nominee. Democrats have held a state-by-state roll call vote at every convention since 1964 when Lyndon Johnson was approved by acclamation.

The last time a Democratic presidential roll call went more than one ballot was in 1952. Adlai Stevenson was selected on the third ballot.

This year, Hillary Clinton's name will be placed in nomination Wednesday in a nod to her historic campaign. She is the first woman ever to win more than one presidential primary. She won 23 contests.
