Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The Chilean miners who were rescued last month after nearly 70 days underground were saluted with a standing ovation at the start of "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute."

The 33 men appeared on stage, with five of their rescuers in the front row, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. CNN brought the group to the United States to attend the gala event, which recognizes the top 10 CNN Heroes of the year.

"For 69 days we were amazed by these 33 brave miners," CNN's Anderson Cooper said in welcoming the miners onto the stage. "Their ordeal was unthinkable; their rescue, unbelievable. No one has ever been trapped underground so deep for so long and survived.

"They endured a nightmare, experienced a miracle, and in the end became each others' brothers and heroes."

After the miners sang the Chilean national anthem, two of them -- speaking through a translator and holding the Chilean flag -- expressed their appreciation.

"We want to thank the world, and we want to thank God for your prayers," Luis Urzua told the audience in Spanish.

"Our families suffered. Our children suffered, too. But thanks to the prayers of the whole world, we could come out of this difficulty," Mario Sepulveda added.

"Some of our rescuers are here with us tonight," Urzua said. "Thank you for bringing us home. You are our heroes."

The five rescuers were selected to represent the many thousands whose talent and effort led to the dramatic rescue.

The tribute show, taped November 20, premiered worldwide on Thanksgiving night. CNN Heroes -- everyday people who are changing the world for the better -- have been profiled weekly on the network since January. They were chosen from more than 10,000 nominations submitted by viewers in 100 countries.

A blue-ribbon panel of judges, including Muhammad Ali, Sir Richard Branson and Yo-Yo Ma, selected the top 10 Heroes, who will each receive $25,000 for their cause. An additional $100,000 will go to CNN Hero of the Year Anuradha Koirala, who was revealed at the end of the tribute show Saturday night. The Hero of the Year was selected by the public in an eight-week online poll.

Performing at the tribute show were Grammy Award-winning artists Bon Jovi, John Legend and Sugarland.

Rock legends Bon Jovi perfomed "What Do You Got?" a new song from their greatest hits album, which came out earlier this month. Legend performed "Wake Up Everybody" along with hip-hop artist Common and R&B singer Melanie Fiona. Sugarland performed "Stand Up," a new song from their album "The Incredible Machine," which made its debut in October.

Joining the list of stars participating in the show were presenters Halle Berry, Demi Moore, Jessica Alba, Kid Rock, LL Cool J, Renee Zellweger, Gerard Butler, Kiefer Sutherland, Marisa Tomei, Aaron Eckhart and Holly Robinson Peete.
