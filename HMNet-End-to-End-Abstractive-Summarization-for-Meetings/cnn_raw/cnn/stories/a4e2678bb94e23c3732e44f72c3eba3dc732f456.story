Moscow (CNN) -- Six people died in a plane crash in western Russia on Saturday, an emergency official said.

The victims were all crew members on an Antonov An-148 plane belonging to an aircraft factory, Emergency Situations Ministry spokeswoman Elena Smirnykh said.

The crash, which occurred in the Belgorod region, did not involve any casualties or damage on the ground.

The state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported that the plane was being tested prior to delivery to Myanmar, which had ordered two An-148 aircraft last year for government use.

At least two of the victims were from Myanmar, the news agency said.

The An-148 can seat up to 100 passengers, according to RIA Novosti.
