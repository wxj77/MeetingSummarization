Hillary Clinton takes the top spot on a list of admired living women for the 13th year in a row, according to an annual survey released by Gallup on Monday.

President Barack Obama, meanwhile, is considered the most admired living man in any part of the world.

When asked to name a woman they've heard or read about and admire, 12% mentioned Clinton, the former secretary of state, New York senator and first lady.

Eight percent said Oprah Winfrey, 5% said Nobel Peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai, and 4% said first lady Michelle Obama.

Other names mentioned included actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie (2%), former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (2%), Princess Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge (2%), Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts (1%), and former first lady Laura Bush (1%).

Clinton, who's considered the Democratic frontrunner if she runs for president in 2016, has also held the top spot in 17 of the past 18 years. Laura Bush was considered the most admired woman in 2001, not long after the 9/11 attacks.

In the seven decades that Gallup has been asking the question, Clinton has won the designation more than any other woman, including six times more than former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.

Obama is also continuing a streak, with this year marking his seventh year in a row as the most frequently mentioned man who people admire most. He was given the designation in 2008 shortly after winning election to his first term.

According to Gallup, the U.S. president is almost always mentioned as the most admired man, with only 12 exceptions in the past 68 years.

This year 19% said the president's name, while 6% said Pope Francis. Also on the list was former President Bill Clinton (3%), Rev. Billy Graham (2%), former President George W. Bush (2%), renowned neurosurgeon and conservative activist Ben Carson (1%),  Stephen Hawking (1%), Bill Gates (1%), Fox News host Bill O'Reilly (1%), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (1%) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (1%).
