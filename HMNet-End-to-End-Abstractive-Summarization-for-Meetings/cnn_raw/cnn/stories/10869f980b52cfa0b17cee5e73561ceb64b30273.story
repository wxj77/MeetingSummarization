Ten everyday people will be recognized Thursday for their remarkable efforts to make the world a better place.

CNN's Anderson Cooper will reveal this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes during the 8 a.m. hour of "New Day."

All the Top 10 Heroes were nominated by CNN's global audience and profiled earlier this year on CNN. Each will receive $25,000 and be honored at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute," a globally broadcast event that airs December 7.

One of the Top 10 will receive an additional $100,000 for their cause if the public chooses them as the CNN Hero of the Year.

Starting Thursday morning, you will be able to vote for your favorite Top 10 Hero at CNNHeroes.com.  Voting ends November 16.

Last year's Hero of the Year was Chad Pregracke, who has dedicated his life to cleaning up the Mississippi River and other American waterways. "The garbage got into the water one piece at a time," said Pregracke, whom some have called "the rivers' garbageman." "And that's the only way it's going to come out."

Since 1998, nearly 70,000 volunteers have helped Pregracke and his nonprofit remove nearly 8 million pounds of garbage from 23 rivers across the country.  "I'll just keep on cleaning up America's rivers and loving every minute of it," said Pregracke when he accepted the award.

This is the eighth year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. In those years, the campaign has profiled more than 200 people on CNN and CNN.com.

This year's tribute show will again be held in New York and hosted by Cooper at the American Museum of Natural History.
