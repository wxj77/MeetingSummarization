Brunswick, Georgia (CNN) -- A Glynn County, Georgia, grand jury indicted two teenage defendants in the death of a 13-month-old boy, the district attorney announced Wednesday.

Because the defendants were younger than 18 when the killing took place on Thursday, they cannot face the death penalty if convicted.

De'Marquise Elkins, 17, and Dominique Lang, 15, were charged with murder last week and made their first court appearance Monday.

CNN is identifying Lang because he is charged as an adult and media in the community have been naming him since he was arrested.

Elkins faces malice and felony murder charges. Lang is accused of felony murder.

Among other charges, each teen is accused of aggravated assault, criminal attempt to commit armed robbery and first-degree cruelty to children. Elkins also is accused of attempted robbery on March 11.

According to the indictment, the gun used in each case was a .22-caliber revolver.

Last week, Sherry West told reporters she was pushing her baby, Antonio Santiago, in a stroller in broad daylight in Brunswick, Georgia, when two teenagers approached her.

One demanded money and pointed at her what West first thought was a fake gun. But he fired at her twice, missing her head and hitting her in the leg, West said. The teen then shot the baby Antonio in the face, West said.

Neither teen entered a plea during Monday's court hearing.

The indictment also includes charges against Elkins' mother, Karimah, his sister, Sabrina Elkins; and an aunt, Katrina Elkins.

Karimah and Katrina Elkins are accused of making a false statement. Karimah and Sabrina Elkins are charged with tampering with evidence by throwing a firearm into a pond. The mother also is accused of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
