(CNN)Hey, nature, thanks for reminding us that you are not to be played with.

Unless you are an adorable Australian quokka. We would play with them all day long.

From battling water creatures to lions opening car doors, animals have taken center stage on social media. And this is not your typical animal kingdom.

Check it out:

This bald eagle protecting her eggs in the snow in Pennsylvania has captured the Internet's heart. There is even a live stream.

According to Mashable, digital media producer Benjamin Savard was working on a video for the science department at Middlebury College in Vermont on Monday when he put a GoPro in a waterproof case inside an octopus tank.

The octopus grabbed it, took some selfies and then snapped a shot of Savard.

Which, of course, brings to mind the epic battle last month between an octopus and crab on an Australian beach.

This octopus at the Seattle Aquarium decided enough was enough last month and tried to escape its tank.

Land creatures are not to be outdone, however.

A video from 2014 gained attention this week, showing a lion opening the car door of a family driving through a safari park in South Africa.

As someone in the car says, "Oh, my gosh, I didn't know they could do that."

We are still giggling at the #WeaselPecker phenomenon: a photo of a weasel hitching a lift on the back of a flying woodpecker. The memes, people, the memes!

Finally, our beloved quokkas, a type of rodent, are the new stars of Instagram as folks in Australia clamor for selfies.
