(CNN Student News) -- March 3, 2014

In today's show, we explain how tensions have escalated in Ukraine, how sudden rain for a drought-stricken state made some matters worse, and how NASA plans to keep closer tabs on global weather. We also kick off Women's History Month with a report about a young woman who's making sports history at her high school.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.
