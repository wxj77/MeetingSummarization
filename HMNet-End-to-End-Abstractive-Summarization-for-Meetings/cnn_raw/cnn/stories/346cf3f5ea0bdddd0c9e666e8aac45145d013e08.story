The remains of all 44 Malaysian passengers of Flight MH17 have been identified, a government statement says.

MH17 was en route from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on July 17 when it was apparently shot down by a missile as it flew over Ukraine. All 298 people on board were killed, including 15 Malaysian crew members.

The last Malaysian identified was Allahyarhamah Puan Sri Siti Amirah Prawira Kusuma, who will be buried in the Netherlands at the request of her family, according to a statement from Malaysian Transport Minister Dato' Sri Liow Tiong Lai.

"During this difficult time, the families of the passengers and crew of MH17 remain foremost on our minds and we continue to keep them in our prayer," he said. "I wish to reiterate our commitment to the families of the passengers and crew of MH17 and the fact that justice must be served on the criminals who caused this heinous act. Towards this end, investigations at the crash site must continue despite the on-going geopolitical situation on the ground."

The United States and Ukraine have accused pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of downing the plane with a missile, a charge the rebels have denied.

A preliminary report by the Dutch Safety Board in September supported that theory, saying the plane was hit by "high-energy objects," but it did not cast blame.

About two-thirds of those killed were Dutch, with Malaysians and Australians making up a large proportion of the others.
