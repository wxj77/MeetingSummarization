(CNN) -- Superstar DJ Avicii canceled his Ultra Festival performance this weekend to undergo gall bladder surgery.

The Swedish artist behind the hit song "Wake Me Up" was scheduled to perform in Miami on Saturday, but was hospitalized with severe abdominal pains.

"I woke up on Wednesday morning with serious pain, but I flew to Miami anyway, hoping that it would go away," he said in a statement Friday.

"The pain was still there when I landed, so I went straight to hospital. I was treated and left later that night."

Doctors scheduled surgery Saturday to remove his gall bladder after the pain returned.

He described it as a routine procedure, and said he expects to be back on his feet for his "True Tour," which starts next month.

The artist, whose real name is Tim Bergling, became an international star as a DJ and producer in electronic dance.

His other hit songs include "Levels," which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Dance Recording last year.
