(CNN) -- An earthquake hit the Dominican Republic Thursday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported, almost exactly two years to the day after a massive quake devastated the neighboring nation of Haiti.

The 5.3 quake was centered in the south of the country, about 170 miles (270 km) east of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, the USGS said.

General Juan Manuel Mendez of the Dominican Republic Emergency Operations Center said there were no reports of damage yet, but added: "We will be checking once it is daylight."
