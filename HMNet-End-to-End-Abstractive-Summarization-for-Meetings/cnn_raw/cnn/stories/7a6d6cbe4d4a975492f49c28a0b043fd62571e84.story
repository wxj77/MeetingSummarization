(CNN) -- English double winners Chelsea have completed their second major signing of the summer after swooping for Benfica's Brazilian international midfielder Ramires on Friday.

The 23-year-old -- who starred for Brazil at the World Cup finals in South Africa -- has signed a four-year contract for a fee in the region of 20 million euros.

The protracted transfer, which was held up because of work permit issues, has signed too late to make his debut in the opening Premier League match against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.

Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti told a press conference: "He is a fantastic player, a fantastic midfielder.

"He is very young and will be the future of the Brazilian national team, and I hope he will be the future of Chelsea."

Speaking to the club's official website, former Cruzeiro midfielder Ramires added: "Every player in the world would love to play for Chelsea.

"It's a great opportunity that was given to me, I will give my best to repay this chance, and I am very happy."

Ramires joins Yossi Benayoun, who joined from Liverpool, in signing for the London club this summer.

However, a number of players have left Stamford Bridge since the 'Double' was won in May with Joe Cole, Michael Ballack, Juliano Belletti, Deco, Ricardo Carvalho and Scott Sinclair all departing over the close season.
