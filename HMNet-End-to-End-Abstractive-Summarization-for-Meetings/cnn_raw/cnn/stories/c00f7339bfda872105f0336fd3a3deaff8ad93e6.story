(CNN)  -- The public will get the other side of the story of the South Carolina governor sex scandal sooner, as the governor's estranged wife Jenny Sanford's memoir publishing date has been moved up.

Sanford's book,  "Staying True," will now hit bookstores on February 5 instead of the original April release date, the book's publisher, Ballantine Books, announced Tuesday.

Sanford landed the book deal in September, a few months after her husband, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, admitted having an affair with an Argentine woman.

In December, Jenny Sanford released a statement,saying she was filing for divorce "after many unsuccessful efforts at reconciliation."

According to a synopsis of the book on the publisher's Web site, her memoir "reveals the private ordeal behind her very public betrayal -- and offers inspiration for anyone struggling to keep faith during life's most trying times."

"She chose to let Mark Sanford deal with the embarrassment and political fallout from his own actions while focusing her own efforts privately on raising their children to be men of character, even in the face of the lies their father has told," the synopsis reads.

After the governor made a nationally televised admission about his affair, there were calls for Sanford's resignation and investigations by media organizations and the state Ethics Commission into whether he tapped taxpayer resources for personal use.

In November, the ethics panel charged Sanford with 37 violations of the state ethics code. The commission will hear arguments involving those civil charges some time this year.
