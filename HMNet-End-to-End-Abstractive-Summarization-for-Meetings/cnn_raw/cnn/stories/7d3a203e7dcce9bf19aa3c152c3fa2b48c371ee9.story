Rome (CNN) -- Mount Etna rumbled Wednesday, sending lava down its side. Italian vulcanologists are monitoring the Sicilian volcano, they said Thursday.

Etna began tremors Tuesday night, the Italian Institute of Vulcanology said.

They reached their peak Wednesday morning, and lava flowed down the eastern rim on Wednesday night.

The volcano may be producing ash, scientists said, but did not offer confirmation.

Etna does not appear to be threatening people at the moment.

One of the most active volcanoes in the world, it towers over the city of Catania on the island of Sicily.
