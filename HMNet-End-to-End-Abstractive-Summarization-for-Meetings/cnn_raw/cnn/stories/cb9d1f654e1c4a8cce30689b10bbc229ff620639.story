(CNNGo.com) -- Globe-trotters know what it's like trying to sleep coiled up on a hard plastic airport seat for hours while they await their next flight. But it doesn't have to be that way.

Transit hotels are making long, multi-flight trips tolerable.

These short-stay hotels are located within security checks in airports and close to terminals. Passengers can walk off the plane and check into a room to refresh between long flights.

No visa is required to stay over in a given country.

Rates at transit hotels vary but are often cheaper than at regular hotels.

Minimum required stays average about six hours. Standard amenities include a bed, desk, toilet, shower and Internet access, but many premium transit hotels include gyms and spas, as well.

Transit hotel hot spots

Because business depends on a heavy flow of onward-bound passengers, transit hotels are nearly exclusive to busy transfer hubs, especially in Asia.

One of the most popular transit hotels is at Singapore's Changi, one of the world's busiest airports and a frequent layover spot for flights to and from Asia.

Amsterdam Schiphol Airport is one of the busiest airports in Europe -- its compact and clean "Yotel" hotel pods do good business.

You won't find in-airport transit hotels in Melbourne Tullamarine Airport or Sydney Airport's international terminal -- Australia is not a common midway point for journeys.

Good for business, but good business?

Nigel Summers, director of the world's largest hospitality consulting firm, Horwath HTL, says that transit hotels can be a tricky investment for hoteliers.

"You don't have to give people much [because it's a very short stay], but it can be difficult to predict the flow of people," Summers says.

"For example, if there is a major closure at an airport, it can be hard to plan how much food to prepare and how much staff to keep on."

The success of transit hotels also depends on the efficiency of the airport, with more efficient airports being less suitable for hotel business.

"If it is easy to clear customs, say at Hong Kong, people are probably less likely to stay inside the airport for their layover," explains Summers.

"But if it's harder, somewhere like New Delhi, people are more likely to find accommodation inside the airport."
