Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan made sure she made it to the Los Angeles morgue early Friday for her first day of court-ordered community service.

"We can confirm she came in well before her appointed time, between 6 and 6:30 this morning," Los Angeles County Coroner Assistant Chief Ed Winter said Friday.

Thursday was suppose to be Lohan's first day of work as a morgue janitor, but she was sent away after showing up late for the morning's orientation.

Publicist Steven Honig blamed her tardiness on "a combination of not knowing what entrance to go through and confusion caused by the media waiting for her arrival."

As part of her sentence for a necklace theft conviction, Lohan was ordered to work 120 hours at the county morgue after she completed 360 hours of community service at the Los Angeles Downtown Women's Center, but she was booted from that program for missing too many appointments.

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner ruled Wednesday that Lohan had violated her probation. Lohan posted $100,000 bail for her probation revocation, but Sautner ordered her to perform two working shifts -- or eight hours a day -- twice a week at the morgue until her probation revocation hearing November 2.

"Her duties will include general janitorial work like vaccuuming, taking trash out and cleaning bathrooms," Winter said.

Lohan, 25, was on probation after pleading guilty in May to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. She served five weeks of home confinement ending in June for that misdemeanor theft and violation of another probation.

Lohan's legal woes began in 2007 with two drunken driving arrests, and they've been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes and her failures of alcohol and drug tests.
