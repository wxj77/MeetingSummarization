Hong Kong (CNN) -- A court in Hong Kong has ruled that a British banker charged with the grisly murder of two Indonesian women is psychologically fit to enter a plea on both counts.

However, the case has been adjourned until July next year to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed.

Rurik Jutting has been in custody since November 1 following the discovery of the bodies of the two women at his home in an upscale residential complex in the city's Wan Chai district.

His last court appearance on November 10 was adjourned after prosecutors requested psychological assessments of the former employee of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Jutting, who has yet to enter a plea, appeared in court Monday unshaven and wearing the same dark sunglasses. He spoke only once to confirm that he understood what was happening.

Body in suitcase

The 29 year old is accused of killing Sumarti Ningsih, 25, whose decomposing body was discovered inside a suitcase on the balcony of his high-rise apartment.

The other woman, Seneng Mujiasih, 29, was found on the floor of the one-bedroom apartment with her throat slashed.

Police say Jutting called them to the apartment early on November 1. They say Mujiasih had been killed that day, and Ningsih five days earlier.

The principal magistrate, Ms Bina Chainrai, ruled that Jutting would remain in custody until the hearings resume on July 6.

The defense had questioned the length of the latest adjournment, but prosecutors pointed out that the government's forensics department estimated a 28-week period for sifting through the body of evidence.

The bodies of the two victims have since been flown back to Indonesia for burial.

Sumarti's father has called for his daughter's killer to be executed, but Hong Kong doesn't impose the death penalty.

CNN's Vivian Kam, Jonathan Stayton and Andrew Stevens in Hong Kong contributed to this report.
