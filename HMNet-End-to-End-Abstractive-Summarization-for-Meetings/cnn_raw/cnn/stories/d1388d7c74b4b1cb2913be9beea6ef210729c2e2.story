(CNN) -- These aren't your stereotypical greasy airport burger and fries.

Airports from the United States, England and Denmark dominated the Moodie Report's third annual Airport Food & Beverage Awards, which were announced Wednesday evening in Dubai.

"We have been deeply impressed by the volume and, more importantly, quality of nominations this year," said Martin Moodie, Moodie Report founder and chairman, in a statement prior to the awards announcement. The Moodie Report owns and produces the conference and the awards.

"There's plenty of innovation and an intriguing reflection of a number of the sector's most notable trends," Moodie said.
