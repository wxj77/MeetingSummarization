(CNN Student News) -- April 3, 2014

It struck with tremendous force, but it appears to have caused limited damage: Today, we'll explore the effects of an 8.2-magnitude earthquake near Chile. We also explain why it's so difficult for recovery officials to sort through the aftermath of a mudslide in Washington state. And we'll introduce you to a student who gained acceptance to every school in the Ivy League.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.

Discussion Questions:

1. In the video we hear that the U.S. flags flying above the mudslide search zone are "a source of strength and a symbol of hope for better days." Can you think of any other times when symbols have helped people affected by a disaster? Explain. Why do you think symbols can be so powerful, especially in times of tragedy?
