(CNN) -- Legendary singer Etta James has been hospitalized with a blood infection, her son told CNN Friday.

Sametto James said his 73-year-old mother was admitted to a hospital in Southern California on Monday due to a urinary tract infection that led to sepsis. She remained in the hospital Friday, he said.

"She's doing a little bit better, but she's not out of the woods quite yet," Sametto James said.

Etta James, best known for her 1961 hit "At Last," was hospitalized in 2010 due to a dangerous staph infection. She was diagnosed in 2009 with Alzheimer's disease.
