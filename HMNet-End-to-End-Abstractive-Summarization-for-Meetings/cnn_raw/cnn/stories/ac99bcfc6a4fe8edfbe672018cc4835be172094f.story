(CNN) -- Apple is planning to introduce a smart home concept at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, according to a report.

The Financial Times says the company is planning to showcase a system that lets users control their lights, appliances and security systems with their iPhones when the conference kicks off June 2. The rumored introduction comes after Google purchased Nest Labs, a smart thermostat started by former Apple execs Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, for $2.8 billion in January.

A "select number" of device makers will be certified to offer products that work with Apple's upcoming system, according to the report, which didn't name any of the manufacturers.

Apple could not be reached for comment. The company signaled its interest in the category in a June 2012 patent filling for a technology that connects lighting systems, security systems, garage-door openers, music controllers, climate controllers or kitchen appliances with mobile devices.

The Internet of Things, as the class of smart appliances that interact with mobile devices and desktops is known, will account for 9 billion products by 2018, according to Business Insider.
