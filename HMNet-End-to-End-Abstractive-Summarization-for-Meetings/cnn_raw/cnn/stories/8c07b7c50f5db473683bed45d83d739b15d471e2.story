(CNN) -- Spaniard Jorge Lorenzo will miss the final race of 2011 MotoGP season in Valencia this weekend as he continues to recover from a finger injury.

The Yamaha rider required plastic surgery to repair a damaged ring finger on his left hand after a crash in Australia three weeks ago.

Lorenzo, 24, is guaranteed second place in the world championship due to the 48-point lead he holds over third-place Honda rider Andrea Dovizioso. Australian Casey Stoner has already secured this year's world championship.

Japanese test rider Katsuyuki Nakasuga will replace the 2010 world champion for Sunday's race in the Spanish port city.

"Lorenzo continues to make good progress in recovery following plastic surgery to repair damage to the ring finger of his left hand sustained in Phillip Island three weeks ago," read a statement on the sport's official website.

"The Mallorcan's injuries require further recovery time to allow him to ride at a competitive level."

This weekend's race will be the first since Italian rider Marco Simoncelli was tragically killed in a crash in Malaysia on October 23.

A 16-meter wall bearing the 24-year-old's racing number of 58 has been erected at the circuit for fans to leave their own personal tributes to the Italian.

In addition, riders will gather on track prior to Sunday's season-ending race to their own tribute to Simoncelli -- who raced for the Honda team.
