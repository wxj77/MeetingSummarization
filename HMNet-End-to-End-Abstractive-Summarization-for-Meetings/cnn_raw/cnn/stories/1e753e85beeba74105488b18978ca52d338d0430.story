(CNN) -- One of three siblings accused of robbing a bank and trying to kill police officers last year has accepted a plea deal that calls for at least nine years in prison, according to court documents.

Lee Grace Dougherty, 29, pleaded guilty Thursday in a Colorado courtroom to one count of attempted first-degree assault and two counts of felony menacing, CNN affiliate KRDO reported.

Prosecutors will drop the laundry list of other charges against her, including five counts of attempted second-degree murder, according to the plea agreement.

She faces a maximum of 28 years in prison when she is sentenced on April 30, according to court documents.

Dougherty and her brothers, Dylan Stanley Dougherty and Ryan Edward Dougherty, are all accused of taking part in a multistate crime rampage that gripped the nation last year.

The trio is accused of an armed bank robbery in Georgia and the attempted murder of a Florida police officer on August 2. They escaped from Florida with police in pursuit after they shot out a police cruiser's tire, according to authorities.

The next week, the trio surfaced in Colorado and were again pursued by police. They were arrested after a high-speed chase on a rural stretch of interstate.

They crashed their car along a rural road and police say they were shooting at officers with an AK-47 during a chase at speeds of up to 120 mph.

Just before they were captured, she pointed her pistol at a Colorado police chief, but the chief fired his .40-caliber handgun first, wounding her in the right upper thigh, according to court documents.

"I deserved to get shot," she later told the FBI. "I pointed the gun at the cop."

Dougherty still faces charges in Georgia and Florida.
