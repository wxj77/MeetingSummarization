(EW.com ) -- NBC's "The Voice" switched to live shows for the first time this cycle on Monday night, but a chunk of viewers shrugged off the next phase of the hit reality competition series.

"The Voice" was down 15 percent from last week's episode in the adult demo to mark its lowest Monday performance ever (chart below), yet still once again charted as the night's top-rated show. "The Voice" typically tends to dip somewhat when it moves away from the spinny-chairs audition rounds. At least the show provided some high-wire drama when a Top 12 contestant endured a live TV microphone fail.

At 10 p.m., NBC was surely thankful to see "The Blacklist" steady with last week's performance despite having a weaker lead-in this time and original competition from ABC's "Castle."

Speaking of, ABC's rival reality veteran Dancing With the Stars had lousy news, down 9 percent to post its lowest rating this cycle.

Over on CBS, 2 "Broke Girls" was down 9 percent from last week's debut in the 8 p.m. slot. The network is hoping this show can be a kick-starter for the block like "How I Met Your Mother" was, but this dip is a tad worrisome (maybe last week's guest star Lindsey Lohan needs to be a series regular? ... No, we don't really believe that).

On The CW, "Tomorrow People" returned from a three week break and plummeted 40 percent from its most recent original. The CW has nothing but hard choices to make in terms of which of its bubble shows (Tomorrow, "Beauty and the Beast," "The Carrie Diaries," "Hart of Dixie") it renews for another season. The rest of the night's shows were largely on par.
