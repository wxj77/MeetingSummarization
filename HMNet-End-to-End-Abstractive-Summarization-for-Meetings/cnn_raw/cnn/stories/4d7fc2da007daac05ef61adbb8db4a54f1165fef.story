(CNN) -- Actress Molly Glynn, who played an emergency room doctor on several "Chicago Fire" episodes, died from injuries after a tree fell on her during a storm, her husband said.

Glynn, 46, was on a bike ride on a suburban Chicago trail with her husband, Joe Foust, when the accident happened, Foust said in a Facebook posting Friday afternoon.

"Friends, this is the darkest day of my life," Foust, also an actor, wrote. "Things will never be the same. Molly got hit by a falling tree while we were biking. At hospital now. Prognosis is grim."

The Chicago Tribune quotes Foust saying the tree was knocked over by high winds when a storm erupted Friday afternoon.

Glynn died from her injuries in an Evanston, Illinois, hospital Saturday.

"I couldn't save her," Foust wrote to friends Saturday. "I couldn't save her. She's gone."

The Cook County, Illinois, coroner's office was conducting an autopsy Monday to confirm the cause of death, an investigator told CNN.

While Glynn acted in several roles on television and in film, most of her acting career was spent on the stages of Chicago.

Her death has hit the Chicago theater community hard. An online fundraising effort quickly collected nearly $135,000 for her husband, who revealed on Facebook that the couple "had less than 70 bucks in the bank."

"So grateful for the assistance," Foust wrote.
