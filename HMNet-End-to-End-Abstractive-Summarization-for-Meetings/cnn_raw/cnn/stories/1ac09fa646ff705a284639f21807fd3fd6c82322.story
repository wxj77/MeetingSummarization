(CNN) -- David Ferrer will aim to become the first Spaniard to win the Miami Masters after beating Germany's Tommy Haas in an absorbing semifinal on Friday.

The trophy has proved beyond the reach of three of his compatriots in the past, with Rafael Nadal having failed on three occasions (2005, 2008, 2011) to add to previous failures by Carlos Moya (2003) and Sergi Bruguera (1997).

The third seed, who celebrates his 31st birthday on Tuesday, will play either Andy Murray or Richard Gasquet in Sunday's final after recovering from a break down in the third set to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.

The world No. 5 finally ended a fine championships for Haas who, at 34, was bidding to become the oldest man to reach the final since Jimmy Connors in 1988.

The German, who slayed world No. 1 and defending champion Novak Djovokic in the quarterfinals, took his fine form into the clash as he powered his way to the first set in Key Biscayne.

Losing the opener only served to focus Ferrer's concentration however and he broke Haas in the sixth game of the second before repeating the feat to take the set 6-2.

When Haas broke in the first and third games of the third set, the German seemed to have regained the initiative only for Ferrer to find his way back into the match through his trademark resilience.

2013 has started in superb fashion for the Spaniard, who can win his third title of the year on Sunday -- with the Australian Open semifinalist having already triumphed in Auckland and Buenos Aires.

Ferrer is into his fifth ATP World Tour Masters 1000 final although his only success came last November when beating Poland's Jerzy Janowicz in Paris.

While no Spanish male has ever lifted the title in Key Biscayne, the ladies' trophy has previously been claimed by Spain -- with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario beating Gabriela Sabatini in 1992, before defending her crown against Steffi Graf the following year.
