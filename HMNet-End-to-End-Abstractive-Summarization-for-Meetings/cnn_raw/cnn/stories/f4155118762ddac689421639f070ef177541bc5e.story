(CNN) -- Police are still searching for a Norman Rockwell painting that disappeared from a Queens storage warehouse in September.

The oil on canvas painting, "Sport," shows a man in a rowboat wearing a yellow raincoat, holding a fishing pole.

The image was published on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post in 1939.

The painting disappeared from a WelPak Art Moving and Storage unit at 58-60 Grand Avenue in Maspeth.

Police said the painting was being stored awaiting shipment to its owner. Neither NYPD nor Sotheby's would identify the owner of the painting.

The painting sold for $1,085,000 at a Sotheby's auction of American Art in New York on May 22. It was sold from a private collection in Birmingham, Alabama, and before that was owned by the Hildebrandt family of Westchester County.

Signed by Rockwell on the lower right, the painting is approximately 22 by 28 inches and framed in gold wood.

Anyone with any information about the missing painting should contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers website or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) and entering TIP577.
