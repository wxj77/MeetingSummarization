(CNN) -- The FBI was investigating after a dead newborn baby was found onboard a Carnival cruise ship, authorities said Sunday.

The baby was found by a Carnival Dream crew member Wednesday morning in a guest cabin, said Special Agent Dave Couvertier, spokesman for the FBI field office in Tampa, Florida. Carnival personnel reported the discovery to Dutch authorities on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten, where the ship was docked.

Dutch authorities took custody of the infant's body and interviewed the 20-year-old mother, an American passenger, Couvertier said in an e-mail. The FBI was coordinating with Carnival Cruise Lines, he said, adding the company has been "fully cooperative."

The FBI's Evidence Response team was activated Saturday when the ship returned to Port Canaveral, Florida, he said. Agents processed and searched two guest cabins and interviewed crew members and passengers.

"Due to the international and jurisdictional aspects involved with this incident, we are still working on obtaining facts and specific details," Couvertier said. "No one has been charged as we are still working on obtaining facts and gathering any available evidence. As a result, no information has been released regarding any suspect at this time."

The baby's mother remained in St. Maarten and is expected to return to the United States within the next 24 hours, Couvertier said Sunday. The FBI was coordinating with Dutch authorities.
