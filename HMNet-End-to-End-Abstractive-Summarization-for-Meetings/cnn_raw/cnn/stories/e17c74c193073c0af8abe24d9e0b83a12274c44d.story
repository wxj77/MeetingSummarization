(CNN) -- Them's fightin' words, Anthony Daniels.

In a tweet on Sunday, the once and forever C-3PO of "Star Wars" threw down a gauntlet: " 'No movie sequel is better than The Empire Strikes Back.' You might eat those words for Xmas dinner in 2015. Joy & Indigestion to the world!"

It's obvious what he's implying. The new "Star Wars" is due out December 18, 2015, and if Daniels' opinion means anything, it'll be more highly thought-of than Episode V, "The Empire Strikes Back," which has long been hailed as the best of the "Star Wars" movies -- and one of the best sequels of all time.

In fact, in a reader poll for the British magazine Empire, it was voted the best movie ever, period. (Take that, "Citizen Kane"!)

Of course, viewers are fickle, and tastes change. Just four years earlier, Empire ranked "Empire" just the sixth-best sequel, behind "The Dark Knight" and "The Godfather Part II," among others. "Aliens" took the top spot in that list.

And both "Godfather II" and "Dark Knight," as well as the final chapter of "The Lord of the Rings," rank higher than "Empire" on the Internet Movie Database's list.

But never you mind. Daniels has stated his claim. Certainly, the new "Star Wars" has some talent on its side, including its screenwriter, Lawrence Kasdan, who co-wrote "Empire" as well.

Still, the best movie sequel? As Yoda would say, see we shall.
