(CNN) -- A jury in Georgia found a man guilty of homicide by vessel in the death of singer Usher Raymond's former stepson.

Kile Glover, 11, and a 15-year-old girl were riding on an inner tube that was being pulled by a pontoon boat on a Georgia lake when a personal watercraft hit them in July 2012, according to witnesses.

Jeffrey Simon Hubbard, a 40-year-old Atlanta man, was operating the personal watercraft, investigators said. He was a family friend who was part of their group outing on Lake Lanier north of Atlanta.

A Hall County, Georgia, jury Thursday found Hubbard guilty on five counts including homicide by vessel in the first degree, serious injury by vessel, reckless operation of a vessel, unlawful operation of a personal watercraft, and a boat traffic violation. Sentencing is set for next month.

Kile suffered a serious head injury and died two weeks later at Children's Healthcare at Egleston in Atlanta.

The boy's mother, Tameka Raymond, was married to Usher for two years. They have two children together from their marriage. They divorced in 2009.

Kile's father is Ryan Glover, the president of Bounce TV, a fledgling television network targeting African-American audiences. He is also a former executive with Turner Broadcasting, the parent company of CNN.
