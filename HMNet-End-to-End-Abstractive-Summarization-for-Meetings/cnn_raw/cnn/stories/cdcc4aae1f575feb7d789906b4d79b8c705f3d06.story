(RS.com) -- Two months after entering the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Kiss will begin celebrating their 40th anniversary with a co-headlining trek with Def Leppard.

The bands have not shared a bill with one another before, but beginning in late June, the hard rockers will be weaving circles across the United States, going from Utah to Texas with gigs on each coast. Tickets for the concerts go on sale March 21 or March 22, depending on the venue.

Def Leppard's Joe Elliott told USA Today that he had first discussed the idea of touring with Kiss with Gene Simmons when the two musicians played together as part of the Rock 'N' Roll All Stars -- a supergroup that also contained current and former members of Guns N' Roses, the Cult, Alice in Chains and more, and toured Latin and South America last year. "It's finally happened, which is fantastic," Elliott said.

"We've run into each other at festivals," Kiss vocalist-guitarist Paul Stanley said, explaining the team-up. "It just seemed to be a natural fit."

Gene Simmons once had to talk Eddie Van Halen out of joining Kiss

To help celebrate their anniversary, Kiss has planned a series of 180-gram vinyl reissues of their catalog. The first batch -- 10 records, including their first four LPs and celebrated "Alive! Live" record, among others -- will hit record stores on April 1.

Two more batches will arrive in May, including the first vinyl pressings of "Psycho Circus" and a "concept album sequence" edition of "Music From the Elder."

The final collection will come out on June 24 and include "Alive II" and each member's '70s solo album.

Def Leppard, for their part, told USA Today that they have been writing new music.

"We all camped out at my house last month and wrote songs, which you will hear none of this summer," Elliott said.

Guitarist Phil Collen estimated a new album would come out next year.
