New York (CNN) -- A veteran police officer died from his injuries Friday after a shooting in Poughkeepsie, New York, according to the Poughkeepsie Police Department.

The name of the deceased officer, an 18-year veteran of the department, was not released pending notification of relatives.

Another police officer was being treated for a minor injury at Vasser Medical Center, Poughkeepsie Police Chief Ronald Knapp said at a press conference Friday afternoon.

"Today is the worst day our city has seen in perhaps our history," Mayor Mike Tkazyik said.

Two other people died in the incident. The suspected gunman died from gunshot wounds at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, according to hospital spokesman Greg Zurawick. Another victim, an unidentified female, was also shot, according to Knapp. She is believed to be the wife of the suspected gunman.

The deceased officer suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, according to Knapp.

A confrontation began around 1 p.m. Friday after Poughkeepsie authorities received reports of a shooting in a small parking lot. An officer noticed a man fleeing the scene of the shooting with a child in his arms and tried to confront the man.

The child was removed from the man, but another confrontation involving multiple officers ensued, Knapp said. That was when the fatal shootings took place.

The child is now in custody of New York state juvenile authorities.
