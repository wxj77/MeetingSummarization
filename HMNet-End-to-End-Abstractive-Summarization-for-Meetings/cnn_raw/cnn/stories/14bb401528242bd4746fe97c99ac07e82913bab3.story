(CNN) -- Police recently seized a cab owned by Jesse Matthew, the last person seen with missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham and who also has been linked to another college student's death in 2009, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.

According to the source, Matthew was driving the cab in 2009, when 20-year-old Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville. She was last seen hitchhiking along U.S. 29 outside of Charlottesville, and her remains were found on a farm months later.

No arrests have been made in her case, and the cause of her death still is under investigation. Yet, late last month, DNA evidence linked Matthew to Harrington's death, a law enforcement source told CNN.

Around that time, Matthew was a private contractor for the owner of a local, now-defunct cab company called Access.

Police have spoken to several cab drivers who worked with Matthew then, the source with knowledge of the investigation said.

Previously, Matthew had worked for at least one other Charlottesville taxi company -- Yellow Cab -- according to its owner Mark Brown. He had a license to operate a taxi in the Virginia city from 2005 to 2010, according to Todd Divers, Charlottesville's commissioner of revenue.

The 32-year-old Matthew is now behind bars, arrested in Texas as a suspect in Graham's disappearance. He was transferred to Virginia and charged with abduction with intent to defile, and is being held in a Virginia jail.

Meanwhile, authorities say they don't know where Graham is.

Almost from the start, speculation was raised about the possibility of a connection between Graham's disappearance and Harrington's death.

"Certainly the question has arisen. It's certainly a legitimate question," Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters last month.
