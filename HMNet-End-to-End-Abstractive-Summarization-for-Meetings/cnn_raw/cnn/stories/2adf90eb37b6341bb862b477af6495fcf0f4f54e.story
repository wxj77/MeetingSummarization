(CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed by ambulance to a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday after suffering a shutdown of blood flow to her left leg, according to her publicist.

Gabor's press representative, John Blanchette, told CNN that Gabor has been sent to UCLA Medical Center. Blanchette said he had no further information about her condition.

It is the second time, Gabor, 94, has taken an emergency trip to hospital since February 1, when she was transported by ambulance because she was spitting blood. Gabor, the previous month, had part of her right leg amputated because of an infection.
