(CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was hospitalized during the day on Friday before being released, his spokesman said.

The Nevada Democrat, 74, checked in not feeling well earlier in the day and doctors diagnosed exhaustion.

Spokesman Adam Jentleson said in a statement that his boss has been cleared to return to work although the Senate has left town for the holidays.

Reid's office said that medical tests were normal, but kept him at George Washington University Hospital during the day for observation. Reid was at home with his wife by evening.

Reid pushed the Senate through marathon sessions this week to clear budget legislation, a massive defense bill and key presidential nominations.

CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this report.
