(CNN) -- Secret Service agents arrested a Washington man Tuesday for making threats against President Barack Obama, a spokesman with the agency said.

The man was identified as Anton Caluori, 31, according to Brian Leary of the Secret Service.

Caluori was charged with making threats against the president and assault on a federal officer.

Leary said the FBI notified the Secret Service about "alarming e-mails."

When agents went to the man's apartment in the Seattle suburb of Federal Way to arrest him, he was armed with a shotgun. Caluori made comments about explosives so a bomb squad was called in, Leary said.

Caluori will make his first appearance in court on Wednesday afternoon.

Agents found two weapons in the apartment, said Emily Langlie of the U.S. Attorney's Office.

Neither Leary nor Langlie specified the nature of the threat.
