Jerusalem (CNN) -- Dozens of Israeli security personnel stormed the compound housing the al-Aqsa mosque Friday after Palestinians threw rocks at nearby police, according to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.

More than 100 Palestinians began throwing rocks at a police location following Friday prayers, prompting the police to enter the compound, Rosenfeld said.

According to witnesses, Israeli forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the Palestinians.

Ziad Hammouri, the director of Palestinian Jerusalem Center for Socio-Economic Rights, said a number of Palestinians were arrested and there were reports of some injuries.

The disturbances mark the latest in a series of clashes and rock-throwing incidents around the compound in the past week, amid reports that Israeli authorities were allowing right-wing Jewish activists access to the site in order to stoke tensions with Palestinians.
