(CNN) -- At least 11 people died and another 50 were injured when the driver of double-decker bus traveling from Bolivia to Argentina lost control of the vehicle, which veered three meters off a cliff, Argentinean state media said.

The crash took place Friday evening in the village of Barcena, about 38 kilometers (24 miles) north of the city of San Salvador de Jujuy, the Telam news agency said.

The bus belonged to Bolivian company Potosi.

Dr. Camilo Eduardo Nevhen, director of the Pablo Soria Hospital in San Salvador de Jujuy, told CNN en Espanol that 69 people were onboard, including the driver and two assistants.

The passengers included 59 adults and seven minors.

The Pablo Soria Hospital admitted 40 patients; four were in intensive care Saturday. The patients include 34 Bolivians, two French nationals, one Spanish national and one Peruvian national.

Telam reported that the passengers included five Argentinians, three Peruvians, three French, one Spanish national and one British national.

Nevhen said some passengers have been in contact with the consulates of Spain, Bolivia and France.
