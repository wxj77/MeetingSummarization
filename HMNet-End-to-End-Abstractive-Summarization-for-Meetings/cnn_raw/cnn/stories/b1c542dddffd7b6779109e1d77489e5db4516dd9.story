(CNN) -- John Mellencamp, known for his nostalgic songs about heartland America, is parting ways with wife Elaine, the couple said in a statement Thursday.

"John and Elaine Mellencamp are proud of their 20 years together and are very happy with their accomplishments both as parents and as a family," a publicist for the singer-songwriter, Bob Merlis, said in a statement.

"They will continue to raise their two children in Indiana but have decided to call it a day as a couple," he said.

Mellencamp's hits include "Pink Houses," "Jack and Diane" and "Small Town."
