Speaking out for the first time since nude pictures of her were leaked on the Internet, actress Scarlett Johansson defended the right to privacy, even for high-profile celebrities such as herself.

Asking why protecting privacy is important is a redundant question, she told CNN's David McKenzie.

"Who doesn't want to protect their own privacy?" she said. "Just because you're an actor or make films or whatever doesn't mean you're not entitled to your own personal privacy. If that is sieged in some way, it feels unjust. It feels wrong.'

Johansson sat down for an interview with CNN in Nairobi, Kenya, following a visit with the humanitarian group Oxfam to see first-hand the impact of the drought and famine that has hit the Horn of Africa.

Her trip came after hackers allegedly stole nude photos from Johansson's cell phone and posted them online earlier this month. The 26-year-old actress has never appeared fully nude in any of her films.

She told CNN that she traveled to Kenya to highlight the depth of human suffering. The "Lost in Translation" and "Girl With a Pearl Earring" star has been an Oxfam ambassador since 2004.

"What struck me the most is the fact that people are just surviving," she said. "They are in sort of a state of limbo."

She said she was touched by the harrowing stories of many of the people she met at refugee camps, including a woman who was forced to leave her handicapped child behind in her search for food.

She said the world was increasingly becoming a smaller place and urged people to get involved with helping others.

"It feels just as wonderful to give as it does to receive," she said.
