(Rolling Stone) -- Rihanna has signed on to be the executive producer of a new fashion competition show being developed for British television.

The show, which does not yet have a title, is set to debut on the Sky Living channel in Britain. It will be hosted by Girls Aloud singer Nicola Roberts and include appearances by Rihanna herself, though it is unclear how frequently the pop star will be on the show.

"I've always had a great love of fashion. It's a constant source of inspiration in my life, and is a big reason why I've grown into the person and artist I am today," the singer said in a statement on Sky Living's website. "I have been very fortunate to work with some truly amazing designers and stylists throughout my career, and they have been instrumental in making sure my creative vision reaches the stage. I am excited to follow the journey of our aspiring contestants and see how their individuality influences their efforts during the course of the show."

The show, which will presumably bear some resemblance to "Project Runway" in terms of format, will culminate with a final challenge in which the remaining designers must create a unique stage outfit for Rihanna's performance at the Wireless festival in Hyde Park, England, in July.
