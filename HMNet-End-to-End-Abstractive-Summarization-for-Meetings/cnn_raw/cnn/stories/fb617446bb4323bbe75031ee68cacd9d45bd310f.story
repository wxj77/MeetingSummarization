Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Militants shot dead 17 people overnight, including 10 local Police officers, as the victims slept, in eastern Afghanistan, officials said Wednesday.

The attack took place at a police outpost in Ghazni province, according to the provincial governor.

In addition to the officers, seven of their friends and relatives who were spending the night were also killed, Gov. Musa Khan Akbarzada said.

Authorities are trying to determine how the militants gained access to the sleeping quarters.

In a separate incident, a suicide bomber targeted an Afghan National Army bus in western Kabul, injuring six personnel and one civilian, according to Kabul police chief Mohammad Ayoub Salangi.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for both attacks.
