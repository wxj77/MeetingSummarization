(CNN) -- A week of Nobel Prize announcements begins Monday in Sweden with the prize for physiology or medicine.

Monday's ceremony at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm will be followed by the announcement of the physics prize on Tuesday, the chemistry prize Wednesday and the economics prize October 13. The prize for literature will be awarded on a date to be announced later.

The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday.

Each prize comes with 8 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million).

Two Americans and a German shared the Nobel Prize in medicine last year.

James E. Rothman and Randy W. Schekman, and German Thomas C. Sudhof were awarded the prize for discoveries of how the body's cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce.

Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel created the prizes in 1895 to honor work in physics, chemistry, literature and peace. The first economics prize was awarded in 1969.
