(RollingStone.com) -- This comedy about a death is a funeral for the audience.

But hey, here's your chance to sit shiva with an all-star cast, led by Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Jane Fonda, Adam Driver and Corey Stoll, who are all led astray by a smarmy script and sitcom-y direction by Shawn Levy ("The Internship," ugh).

Rolling Stone: Aubrey Plaza to voice Grumpy Cat this Christmas

"This Is Where I Leave You" was a 2009 bestseller by Jonathan Tropper, who'd be right to sue if he hadn't written the dumb script himself. From the minute Mom (Fonda) brings the whole mishpocha home to Westchester to honor dear, dead, atheist Dad, the movie embalms every clichÃ© of Jewish-family dysfunction.

Bateman and Fey rise above the material. The others, notably Fonda doing jokes at her own expense, aren't so lucky.

Even if you choke out a laugh -- it's hard not to smile around Adam Driver -- you'll hate yourself for it.
