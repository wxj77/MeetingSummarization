(CNN) -- Former CBS News correspondent Bruce Dunning died Monday from injuries suffered in a fall, CBS News said. He was 73.

The longtime foreign correspondent retired in 2005 after 35 years at CBS News. He spent most of his career reporting from Asia, where he opened the Beijing bureau in 1981, and became the network's Tokyo-based Asia bureau chief in 1989, CBS said.

Dunning was best known for a 1975 report on the last flight out of Da Nang toward the end of the Vietnam War, the network said. His video showed throngs of people storming the plane, hoping for a ride.

He returned to Vietnam to cover the 10th and 20th anniversaries of the fall of South Vietnam, CBS said.

Dunning earned degrees from Princeton and Columbia University. He began his career as a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times in Florida, CBS said.

He lived in Union City, New Jersey and died at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan.

Dunning is survived by his partner, Tetsunori Kawana, a brother and his sister-in-law, CBS said.
