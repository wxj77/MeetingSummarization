(CNN) -- A U.S. guided missile destroyer was involved in a collision with an oil tanker near the Strait of Hormuz, the U.S. Navy announced.

No one on either the USS Porter or the Japanese-owned M/V Otowasan was injured, the Navy said.

The 505-foot Porter is operating under its own power near the strait, a strategically important chokepoint for oil shipments from the Persian Gulf.

The crew is evaluating the damage, which appeared in photos released by the military to be a large dent in the side.

The Norfolk, Virginia-based ship is part of the U.S. 5th Fleet and left its home port on March 12. The Navy said the accident, which occurred Sunday at about 1 a.m. local time, was not combat-related.
