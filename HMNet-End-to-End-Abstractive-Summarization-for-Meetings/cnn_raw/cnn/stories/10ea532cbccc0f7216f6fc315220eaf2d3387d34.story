Economic stories take center stage in Thursday's program, as we report on a milestone for U.S. gas prices, we discuss a decision from the Federal Reserve, and we examine the percentage of Americans living in poverty. We also hear how a civil rights activist is promoting his message against sagging pants, and we share some students' methods for coping with a bad day.
