(CNN) -- The U.S. is considering new security measures at airports due to increased concern that terrorists from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are developing explosives designed to avoid detection by current security screening, U.S. officials tell CNN.

Officials tell CNN there is no imminent threat or plot; however, an additional vulnerability has been identified, which the Department of Homeland Security is working to address.

"DHS regularly monitors intelligence related to terrorist groups seeking to do us harm. DHS regularly re-evaluates our security apparatus, which includes a number of measures both seen and unseen, to fit an ever evolving threat environment," an agency official tells CNN.

In recent months, U.S. officials have warned about al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula terrorists attempting to design new explosive devices to avoid detection.

In February, the government warned airlines about possible shoe bombs, officials told CNN at the time, amid intelligence suggesting tactics tied to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula master bomb-maker Ibrahim al Asiri. A law enforcement source said the U.S. periodically receives information on attempts by those believed to have been trained by al Asiri to develop bombs that could defeat screening systems.
