Washington (CNN) -- Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden -- the son of Vice President Joe Biden -- has suffered what doctors believe to be a mild stroke, according to the hospital.

Biden "was admitted this morning to Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware after having what we believe to be a mild stroke, according to a written statement from Dr. Timothy Gardner, medical director of the Center for Heart and Vascular Surgery at Christiana Care Health System in Delaware.

"He is in good spirits and talking with his family at the hospital. He is fully alert, in stable condition and has full motor and speech skills. We expect him to make a complete recovery."

Biden was scheduled to be transferred later Tuesday to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, "for further observation and examination," according to a statement from the vice president's office.

Biden was joined at the hospital by his wife and his father, according to an earlier statement from the vice president's office.

Biden, 41, was elected as Delaware's attorney general in 2006. He recently served in Iraq for one year as a captain with the Delaware Army National Guard. He was considered a front-runner to fill his father's former U.S. Senate seat this November, but in January he announced he had decided against a run for higher office.

Biden served as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 1997 to 2002.

Biden graduated from the Archmere Academy in Wilmington, Delaware, the University of Pennsylvania and Syracuse University College of Law. He and his wife, Hallie, have two children.
