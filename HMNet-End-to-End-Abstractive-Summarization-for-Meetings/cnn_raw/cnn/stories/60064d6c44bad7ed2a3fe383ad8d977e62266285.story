(CNN) -- If the memory of your university is a somewhat hazy mix of missed lectures, cheap food, empty beer cans and cold, concrete classrooms, you won't recognize this list.

Hamburg-based architectural data company Emporis recently released a report on what it's calling "the world's most spectacular university buildings."

"Lecture halls at dizzying heights, libraries with glass-domed roofs or crooked seminar rooms with slanting walls -- it is not just in the field of learning that universities have plenty to offer, but on an architectural level, too," the report stated.

The 10 buildings include Lomonosov Moscow State University, the world's tallest university building at 240 meters; Swanston Academic Building in Australia, which "catches the eye with its wavy and jagged façade"; and Bradfield Hall at Cornell University in the United States, which is "almost entirely windowless."

The report also describes how old school university buildings are gradually being replaced.

"One by one, chunky relics of the '60s and '70s are being torn down," it states, citing the demolition of the AfE‑Turm in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, which was brought down earlier this month in Europe's largest inner-city controlled blasting.
