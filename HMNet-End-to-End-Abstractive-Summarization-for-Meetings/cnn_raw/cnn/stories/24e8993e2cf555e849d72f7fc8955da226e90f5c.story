(CNN) -- It's raining hard Thursday in Recife, Brazil, where the U.S. is facing off against Germany in a crucial World Cup game.

Yet the pivotal match is being played as scheduled.

Main roads are turning into rivers, and the downpour hasn't let up for nearly 12 hours. Access to the stadium is tough -- a trip that is usually easy on a sunny day. The deluge has already made Thursday the rainiest day in Recife in 2014, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. What's already fallen in six hours' time represents about 25% of the overall monthly average there, Miller said.

It's likely the rain will continue through the match and will be heavy at times.

Cars are barely inching ahead in the flood, said CNN International correspondent Alex Thomas, who is at the World Cup.

Thomas noted that had the U.S.-Germany match been postponed or delayed, the Ghana-Portugal game, also Thursday, would have been affected.

Final group games are mandated to be played at the exact same time to avoid teams colluding to get through because they know the result of the other game in the group.

Meanwhile, there's been drama for Ghana. Two of its star players were thrown out of their squad, accused of physical and verbal attacks within the team's camp.

The Ghana Football Association suspended Sulley Muntari and Kevin-Prince Boateng. Muntari, who plays with Italian side AC Milan, was accused of launching an "unprovoked physical attack" on Moses Armah, a member of the Ghana Football Association, according to a statement on its website.

The association says Boateng launched "vulgar verbal insults" at coach Kwesi Appiah during training this week.
