(CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan is in the spotlight again, this time in London.

On Wednesday, the actress gave her West End debut in David Mamet's film-industry satire "Speed-the-Plow," and the reviews haven't been kind.

According to the New York Daily News, the former "Mean Girls" star turned in a "shaky" performance, and "fumbled for words a few times." The New York paper adds that Lohan "seemed to rely on a book she clutched as a prop that had some lines from the script scribbled in it."

The Daily Beast wasn't any gentler, noting that halfway through the show, "the audience was openly laughing at Lohan's struggle to grasp Mamet's sharp, trademark dialogue."

Before the production opened, Lohan told TimeOut London that she hoped her work on "Speed-the-Plow" will help restore her image.

"I think it shows that I can be accountable, and I think it helps with the perception that I'm just a psycho that goes out and stuff," the actress said. "I've done things, but people grow up and they change. I'm willing to work hard to gain back the respect that I once had and have lost."

As for the future, Lohan added that she does have a five-year plan: "I would like to be married and have children, and hopefully be at the Oscars," the 28-year-old said, "but that's as far as it goes for now."

The production of "Speed-the-Plow" runs at the Playhouse Theater in London until November 29.
