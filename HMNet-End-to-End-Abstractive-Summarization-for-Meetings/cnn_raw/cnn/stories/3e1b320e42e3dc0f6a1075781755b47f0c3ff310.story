New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Police in the Indian city of New Delhi were probing an alleged rape of a 7-year-old girl, a case that sparked angry protests Friday.

No arrests have been made in the act, which allegedly occurred in the municipal school where the girl studied. TV footage showed the demonstrators pelting a bus with stones and smashing its windows, with police trying to control the protests.

Sexual assault on females is a hot-button issue in India. The country is still reeling from the horrific allegations against five men and a juvenile who are accused of gang raping and murdering a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi in December.
