(CNN) -- A body found in a Dumpster near San Francisco, California, has been identified as missing postal worker Nancy Rogers, authorities said Tuesday.

The Hayward, California, police department said Rogers' death is being investigated as a homicide.

Rogers, 61 of Fremont, California, went missing from the post office early Monday in Hayward, about 25 miles from San Francisco, said Hillary Rickher, spokesman for the postal inspector's office in San Francisco.

"Hayward police department is still the lead agency, but we will maintain support for [them]," Rickher said.

The postal inspector's office has already provided lab services, analysts and inspectors to assist the investigation, Rickher said.

Rogers was reported missing about 4:45 a.m., according to Hayward police.
