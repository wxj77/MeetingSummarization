"Almost Human" starred Karl Urban and Michael Ealy as two cops, at least one a robot, who fought crime in the future.

The freshman drama struggled in the ratings on Monday nights, where the last few episodes averaged about 5.6 million viewers and a mere 1.5 rating among adults 18-49 in the overnight numbers.

The somewhat similarly premised CBS freshman drama series "Intelligence," which stars Josh Holloway as a crime fighter with a cyber-wired brain, is still on the bubble for a renewal after likewise struggling on Mondays this season.

The decision came down on the same day "Almost Human" executive producer J.J. Abrams announced the cast for one of his other sci-fi projects, "Star Wars: Episode VII."
