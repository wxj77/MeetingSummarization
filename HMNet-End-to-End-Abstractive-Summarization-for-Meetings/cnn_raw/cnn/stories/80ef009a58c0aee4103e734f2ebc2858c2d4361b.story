(CNN Student News) -- November 13, 2013

As the Philippines struggles to recover from Typhoon Haiyan, CNN Student News shares some stories of survival and desperation. We also report on events in London, Iran, and China before we visit what's officially been declared the tallest U.S. skyscraper. Plus, after hearing a story about the return of discovered money, we ask students to consider how they would react to finding a stash of cash.
