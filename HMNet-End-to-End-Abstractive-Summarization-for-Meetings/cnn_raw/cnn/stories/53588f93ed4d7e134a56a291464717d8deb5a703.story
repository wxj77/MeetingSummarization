(CNN)One of Hollywood's most attractive couples is heading down the aisle.

According to People, Joe Manganiello and Sofia Vergara are engaged. The "True Blood" star reportedly asked the "Modern Family" star to marry him on Christmas Day while the pair vacationed in Hawaii.

The couple have been relatively low-profile, as celebs go, during their six months of dating. They are said to have met in May during the White House Correspondents' Dinner. At the time, Vergara was still with ex-fiance Nick Loeb.

By July, Manganiello and Vergara were being seen together, and he told People she was his celebrity crush: "She's got the curves; she's got a beautiful face, beautiful hair, just gorgeous."

On Sunday, Vergara wished her love happy birthday on her Instagram account with a picture of them and a caption that read "Happy happy bday to my love and best friend to the one that makes me laugh like crazy!have a healthy wonderfull year babe!!!"

Neither has commented on reports of the engagement.
