We're exploring a couple of constitutional issues today, from the concept of war powers in the U.S. government to the concept of selecting a jury. There's some hopeful news concerning the Ebola virus, and there's some expectation that this year's Super Bowl could break all-time television viewership records. And a man in Canada is keeping fun on track for the kids in his neighborhood. Fridays are awesome on CNN Student News!

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
