(CNN) -- An 18-year-old suspect in Tuesday's bus-stop shootings that wounded seven people in Detroit, Michigan, surrendered to authorities Wednesday, police said.

Detroit's deputy police chief called Tuesday's shootings "a travesty."

Detroit Police Chief James Barren said Jamall Turner is one of two suspects in the shootings, which occurred at a bus stop near Cody High School after summer-school classes had ended for the day.

Two men got out of a green minivan and "fired multiple shots at a group of teens waiting on a bus," he said. Police were investigating rumors from witnesses that the shootings were gang-related.

Officials said Tuesday that the gunmen asked for a person by name before shooting, getting back into their vehicle and fleeing.

A third person was waiting in the minivan to aid in their escape, he said.

Police have impounded two vehicles matching the van's description but do not know whether either was actually involved in the crime, he said.

On Tuesday, police took another person into custody in an arrest that was not related to the shootings, "but we believe that the arrested individual may shed light on the bus-stop shooting," he said.

Deputy Police Chief James W. Tolbert said three of the victims remained hospitalized Wednesday with wounds that were not life-threatening.

He said police believe that semiautomatic handguns were used.

"Any time there is a shooting and we have young people shot, it's a travesty," he said. "We have to get our youth to understand that conflict resolution isn't picking up a gun."

Tolbert added that the police are instituting a "safe-routes-to-school program."
