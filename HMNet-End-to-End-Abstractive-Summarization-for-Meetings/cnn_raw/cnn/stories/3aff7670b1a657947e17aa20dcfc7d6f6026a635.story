(CNN)If you're in the mood for thrills and chills on the big screen this year, you won't be disappointed, judging from a slew of fresh movie trailers released recently.

The creepy trailer for "Crimson Peak" went viral after its Friday release, with two versions drawing close to 2 million views by Sunday.

If the first peek of the haunted house horror flick is any indication, director Guillermo del Toro has a lot of frights up his sleeve for the film's October 16 release. From the disturbing automated toy man to the ghostly woman in a bathtub, it's 90 seconds of foreboding imagery.

Another creepy trailer released last week is whetting moviegoers' appetite for horror. Some may scoff at the idea of a remake of the 1982 supernatural hit "Poltergeist," which debuts July 24. But the trailer has plenty of jumpy moments to shock even the most jaded horror fan -- especially if you're afraid of clowns.

Two spy movies on the horizon offer thrills of a different kind. "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.," a reboot of the 1960s TV series, stars Henry Cavill as an ace American secret agent in the 1960s. It hits theaters in August.

Also out in August is "Hitman: Agent 47," an adaption of the popular video game.

If you're wondering where the comedy will be this summer, Amy Schumer makes her big screen debut on July 17 with "Trainwreck." The trailer promises lots of laughs, no surprise considering it's directed by Judd Apatow.
