Don't let those whimsical cable cars and rainbow-colored Victorian homes fool you. San Francisco is one snobby city.

At least that's the consensus of Travel + Leisure magazine's readers, who were asked to rank 35 major U.S. metropolitan areas on their snobbishness.

San Francisco was voted the city that holds its nose highest in the sky, followed by New York City, Boston, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Santa Fe/Seattle, which were tied for fifth.

T+L says readers were asked to consider various factors, such as the city's reputation for aloof and smarty-pants residents as well as the presence of high-end shopping, good-looking locals, trendy food trucks and highbrow cultural offerings like classical music and theater. The mag cites San Francisco's reputation for being a serious foodie city as cause of its high ranking.

Five spectacular global art cities

Other "21st-century definitions of elitism" among the criteria included the city's tech-savviness, number of artisanal coffeehouses and "a conspicuous eco-consciousness" (say, the kind of city where you get a dirty look for throwing your coffee cup in the wrong bin).

New York City is an obvious one, but Santa Fe?

"Georgia O'Keeffe's old stomping ground certainly ranks as an A-list art town with readers," says T+L. "It won the survey for being a cultural getaway and scored highly for its museums."

The ranking is part of the magazine's annual "America's Favorite Cities" survey.

Here are the top 10 cities to make the T+L "America's snobbiest cities" list.

1. San Francisco

2. New York City

3. Boston

4. Minneapolis/St. Paul

5. Santa Fe, Seattle (tie)

7. Chicago

8. Providence, Rhode Island

9. Washington D.C.

10. Charleston, South Carolina
