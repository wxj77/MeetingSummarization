(CNN) -- Singer Marc Anthony filed divorce papers Wednesday, seeking to officially end his marriage with entertainer Jennifer Lopez, a court spokesman said.

The singer filed the paperwork in Los Angeles Superior Court, the spokesman said.

The couple announced that they were ending their marriage in July.

Anthony and Lopez wed in 2004, in what was the third marriage for Lopez and the second for Anthony, who had been married to former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres.

"This was a very difficult decision," the couple said in a statement released in July. "We have come to amicable conclusion on all matters. It is a painful time for all involved, and we appreciate the respect of our privacy at this time."
