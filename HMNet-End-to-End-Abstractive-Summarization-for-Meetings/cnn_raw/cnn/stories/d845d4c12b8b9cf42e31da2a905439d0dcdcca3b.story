In Baltimore, Maryland, the city wants to put more than 7,000 to work, mostly in local government jobs. It will use more than $6 million from the federal government and sponsorship money, according to WBAL-TV in Baltimore.

West: FedEx center brings 650 jobs to Oregon

Even before a new FedEx shipping center brings hundreds of jobs to Troutdale, Oregon, it is helping with employment through road construction jobs, according to KPTV-TV in Portland.

The new hub, which is expected to be completed in July 2010, will bring more than 1,000 additional cars to the area, so the Oregon Department of Transportation called for two additional lanes at a nearby major intersection, KPTV reported.

FedEx is expected to employ 650 workers at the facility once it opens, according to KPTV.

"We're creating family wage jobs, because this project will take place this summer," Troutdale Mayor Jim Kight told the station.

Oregon's unemployment rate was a record 12.4 percent in May. Read the full report on KPTV

He was once a senior loan officer who had been laid off and was looking every day for a job anywhere there might be an opportunity.

When he couldn't find the right chance, he created his own.

Kenneth Hodge is now a small business owner, the founder of SFG Records.

"If you look at your failures, if you stare at your failures too long, you'll never go anywhere," Hodge told WPBF. "But if you look beyond your failures, you can move to and fulfill your dreams. You can do that. I think I can do that, and we are doing that."

Six recording artists are featured on his Web site, and Hodge told the West Palm Beach station that he has already hired seven employees. Read the full report on WPBF

Midwest: Iowa town sees trickle-down effect from stimulus

Federal stimulus money indirectly helped an air conditioning company bring 110 workers back to its plant in Marshalltown, Iowa, according to KCCI-TV in Des Moines.

The town's economic development director told KCCI that Lennox was able to hire back the workers because of increased demand.

"There's money from the federal level from tax rebates, and there's usually always money on the other side from the electric company helping out with tax rebates and most people are saying 'Yes, I want to do that,' " Joel Akason told the station.

Lennox is being cautious in its hiring, Akason told KCCI. Most of the positions are temporary, but 45 are permanent, the station reported. Read the full report on KCCI
