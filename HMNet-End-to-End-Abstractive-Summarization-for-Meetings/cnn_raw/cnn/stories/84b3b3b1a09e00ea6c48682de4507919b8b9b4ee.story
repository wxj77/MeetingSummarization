(CNN) -- First of all, of course we'd rather see more original blockbusters created with female leads in mind. Though Hollywood has made strides in recent years toward more gender and racial diversity, success stories like Shonda Rhimes, Mindy Kaling and Tina Fey are still the exceptions, not the rule. There's plenty of research showing that women are still sorely underrepresented onscreen and behind the scenes.

But news that a female version of "Ghostbusters" got us thinking about other films we'd like to see recast with female leads. Turns out it's a ton of fun to imagine who would be the female Cheech or Chong or Indiana Jones.

We also asked CNN's Facebook audience what they thought and came up with the gallery above. Let us know what you'd add in the comments, but keep in mind that "Magic Mike" is well-worn territory.

Zoe Saldana as Harrison Ford in "Indiana Jones"? Why not?
