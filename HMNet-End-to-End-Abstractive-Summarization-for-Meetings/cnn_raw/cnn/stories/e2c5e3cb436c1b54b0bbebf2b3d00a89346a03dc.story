London, England (CNN) -- Former British professional rugby player Terry Newton, who had tested positive for human growth hormone, was found dead over the weekend.

"There are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding his death," a spokesman for the Greater Manchester Police said Monday.

His body was found Sunday at his home in Orrell, in Greater Manchester.

British media reports suggested the 31-year old had taken his own life but CNN could not confirm this.

The Rugby Football League banned him for two years in February and the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats fired him. Newton also played for the Bradford Bulls, Leeds Rhinos and Wigan Warriors.

His autobiography, "Coming Clean," said he used human growth hormone to revive his body.

"We are deeply shocked and saddened by the news of Terry's untimely death," Rugby Football League Chairman Richard Lewis said.

"This is a personal tragedy and our thoughts are with Terry's partner, his children and his family at this terrible time."
