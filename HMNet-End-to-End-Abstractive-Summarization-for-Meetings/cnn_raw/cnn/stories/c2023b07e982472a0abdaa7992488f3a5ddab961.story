(CNN) -- Raul Gonzalez became the leading scorer in Real Madrid history after scoring twice in the 4-0 Primera Liga victory at Sporting Gijon on Sunday.

Raul celebrates in familiar style after breaking Di Stefano's Real Madrid record against Sporting Gijon.

The 31-year-old moved two goals ahead of the legendary Alfredo Di Stefano with his 308th and 309th strikes in the famous white shirt.

Raul is also the all-time leading scorer in the Champions League and has helped the capital club claim six Primera Liga crowns during almost 15 years' service at the Bernabeu.

His first goal, in the 15th minute, came when Sergio Ramos found space down the right before crossing for Raul to volley home.

Dutch forward Klaas-Jan Huntelaar had not scored for Real since his 20 million euro move from Ajax, but finally broke his duck with a neat finish on 37 minutes to double Real's advantage.

Brazilian Marcelo skilfully slotted home the third goal to wrap the game up early in the second half before Raul netted again to complete a comfortable victory.

The win was Real's eighth consecutive Premier Liga success and ensured the defending champions closed the gap to runaway leaders Barcelona to 10 points.

On Saturday, Barca had to come from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Real Betis with Samuel Eto'o scoring both goals to take his tally to 23 goals for the season.
