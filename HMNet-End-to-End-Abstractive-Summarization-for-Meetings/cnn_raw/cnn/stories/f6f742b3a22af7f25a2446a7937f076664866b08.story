London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry is to travel to the United States to be presented with a prestigious award honoring his work with war veterans and serving members of the armed forces.

The Prince will visit Washington D.C. on May 7 to receive the Atlantic Council's award for "distinguished humanitarian leadership," St James's Palace announced Monday.

A spokeswoman for the palace told CNN the trip -- Harry's first to the U.S. since he took part in Apache helicopter training in the deserts of Arizona and California last year -- was likely to be a flying visit, lasting less than 24 hours.

As well as attending the prizegiving dinner at the Atlantic Council, Prince Harry is also expected to meet British and American athletes who have taken part in the Warrior Games, a paralympic sports tournament for armed services personnel, in Colorado.

And while it is not yet clear if he will attend other events while in the country, there is expected to be a huge level of interest in the Prince's travel plans.

When his brother Prince William visited the States last year with the Duchess of Cambridge, the newlywed couple was met with huge and enthusiastic crowds.

Prince Harry is said to be "honored" by news of the award, which he plans to accept on behalf of his brother and their foundation.

St James's Palace says he will use the event to pay tribute to the work of British and American charities which help to rehabilitate wounded servicemen and women, and to reintegrate veterans into civilian life.

The Atlantic Council is a non-partisan U.S.-based think-tank which promotes transatlantic cooperation and international security.

Other high-profile guests whose work will be recognized by the council on May 7 are U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, violin virtuoso Anne-Sophie Mutter, and Unilever CEO Paul Polman.
