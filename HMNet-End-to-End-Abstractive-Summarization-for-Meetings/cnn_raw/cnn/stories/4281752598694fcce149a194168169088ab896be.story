Moscow (CNN) -- Russian security forces have killed an al Qaeda emissary who fought alongside Chechen rebels, officials said Wednesday.

Doger Sevdet, also known as Abdulla Kurd, was killed in Russia's northern Caucasus region, according to a statement from the Russian National Anti-Terrorist Committee.

Russia says that Sevdet had fought with Chechen rebels in one of several al Qaeda units that were led by Arab field commanders Ibn ul-Khattab, Abu al-Walid and Abu Hafs -- all of whom are now dead as well.

Sevdet, a Turkish citizen by birth, moved to the restive Russian region in 1991 after living in neighboring Georgia, the statement said.

He later became al Qaeda's point man in the Northern Caucasus, officials say, assuming control of international money transactions for the regional group soon after Yusef Muhammed al Emirat, a native of Saudi Arabia, was killed by Russian security forces in a sting operation last month in the mountainous district of south Chechnya.

The current round of the Russia-Chechnya conflict dates back nearly 20 years, with Chechens having laid claim to land in the Caucasus Mountains region. Thousands have been killed and 500,000 Chechen people have been displaced by the fighting.

Chechnya is located in the North Caucasus region of Russia between the Black and Caspian seas.
