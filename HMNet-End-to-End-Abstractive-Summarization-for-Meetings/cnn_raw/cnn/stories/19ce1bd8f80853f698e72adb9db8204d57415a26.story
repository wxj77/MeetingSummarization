(CNN)  -- Real Madrid made amends for their midweek Champions League defeat in Lyon with a 6-2 rout of Villarreal in the Bernabeu on Sunday night.

Inspired by the brilliance of Cristiano Ronaldo, Real closed to within two points of leaders Barcelona at the top of the Spanish Primera Liga.

The 1-0 defeat at Lyon has added to the pressure on coach Manuel Pellegrini, but he will rest easier after a comprehensive rout with former World Player of the year Ronado at its heart.

Gonzalo Higuain and Brazilian ace Kaka both scored twice but it was Ronaldo who set Real on the way in the 18th minute with a trademark free kick.

Madeira-born Ronaldo then paid his own tribute to the victims of the floods and mudslides on the Portuguese island by lifting his jersey to reveal a white t-shirt with "Madeira" written on it.

A penalty from former Liverpool star Xavi Alonso completed the goal glut as they kept pace with Barcelona, who had beaten Racing Santander 4-0 on Saturday.

Atletico Madrid had inflicted a first league defeat of the season on Barca last weekend but their joy proved short lived as they were beaten 1-0 by lowly Almeria.

Pablo Piatti scored the winner three minutes from time for Almeria while Malaga boosted their hopes of survival after a 2-1 win at Espanyol.

In the battle for European qualification, Athletic Bilbao kept themselves in the hunt with a 4-1 win over 10-man Tenerife, who had Jose Antonio Culebras sent off in the 17th minute for violent play.

Osasuna and Real Valladolid played to a 1-1 draw in Pamplona as the home side scrambled a point with an 86th-minute equalizer from Javier Camunas.
