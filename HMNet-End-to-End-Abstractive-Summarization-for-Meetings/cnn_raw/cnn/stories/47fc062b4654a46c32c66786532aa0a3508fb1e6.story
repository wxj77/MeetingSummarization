(CNN) -- At this point are there any celebrities left who have not done the Ice Bucket Challenge?

All across the Internet the famous are taking a dousing in the name of raising money -- and bringing awareness -- to Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. The participants include such figures as Iggy Azalea, Lady Gaga and Chris Pratt.

Some, like Justin Bieber, have taken the challenge more than once.

"All right, second Ice Bucket Challenge," Bieber said in a video posted on his Instagram account. "Today I nominate my Beliebers all over the world. I know you guys got an ice bucket."

"Guardians of the Galaxy" star Pratt attempted a different twist by drinking Blue Ice Vodka and Smirnoff Ice instead of dumping an ice bucket on himself. But he didn't get away with his scam as a pair of friends proceeded to pour cold water over him multiple times from a balcony above.

"Really," Pratt sputtered. "That's so cold!"

Pop star Lady Gaga was one of the latest celebs to post her video on her Instagram account. The singer was silent as she sat in a chair, dressed in what appeared to be a studded bathing suit and poured ice water over herself from a massive silver bowl.

"Scandal" star Kerry Washington accepted two bucket challenges -- one as a stand-in for the cast and one for herself. And she wasn't the only celeb from a Shonda Rhimes show to get on board. The cast of "Grey's Anatomy" also participated.

Once the stars have completed the challenge, they have in turn challenged fellow celebs to take the plunge themselves. Others celebs participating include Oprah Winfrey, the cast of "The Voice," Jennifer Lopez, Robert Downey Jr., Nina Dobrev and James Van Der Beek.
