(CNN) -- Move over, Ashton Kutcher. Christian Bale is going to give the role of Steve Jobs a go.

Aaron Sorkin has confirmed to Bloomberg that the "Dark Knight" actor has been cast in an upcoming biopic about the Apple co-founder.

Sorkin, who wrote the screenplay for the acclaimed film "The Social Network," about the founding of Facebook, is at the helm of the picture and said of Bale's casting, "What we needed was the best actor."

"He really is a phenomenal actor," Sorkin said. "He didn't have to audition."

Bale will be in every scene, Sorkin said, and it's an "extremely difficult part."

"He's going to crush it," Sorkin assured.

The film is reportedly based on the "Steve Jobs" biography by Walter Isaacson, which the late Jobs sanctioned. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

Kutcher portrayed the innovator in the 2013 film "Jobs." Bale -- best known for playing Bruce Wayne/Batman in the "Dark Knight" trilogy -- will next be seen in Ridley Scott's "Exodus: Gods and Kings."
