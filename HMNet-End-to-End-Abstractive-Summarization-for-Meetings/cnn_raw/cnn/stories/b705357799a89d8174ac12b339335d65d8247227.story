(EW.com) -- Disappointing news for fans of "All My Children," which was supposed to earn a second lease on life next year when it was supposed to resurface via The Online Network in January.

The company that bought it from ABC may hold off premiering it for at least a few months and focus on getting "One Life to Live" back to fans, instead, according to Variety.

Prospect Park, a media and production company founded in 2009 by Jeffrey Kwatinetz and former Disney Studios head Rich Frank, bought "AMC" and "OLTL" last July after ABC canceled them. ("AMC" ended in September; "OLTL" goes away in January).

The hope was to bow new installments of "AMC" online starting in January, but that was before Prospect started having a tough time securing stars from the longtime serial (here's looking at you, Susan Lucci!).

So far, only Cameron Mathison (Ryan Lavery) and Lindsay Hartley (Dr. Cara Castillo Martin) have agreed to continue with "AMC" once it goes online.

In contrast, "OLTL"'s Erika Slezak (Victoria Lord), along with Ted King (Tomas Delgado), Michael Easton (John McBain) and Kassie DePaiva (Blair Cramer), among others, will stay in the fictitious town of Llanview for Prospect's new venture.

Along with the soaps, The Online Network is supposed to feature entertainment and lifestyle shows.
