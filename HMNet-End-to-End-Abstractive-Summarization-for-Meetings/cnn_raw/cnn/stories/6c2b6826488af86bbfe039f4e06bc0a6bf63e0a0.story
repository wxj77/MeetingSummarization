(CNN) -- Paolo Guerrero scored twice as Hamburg took over top spot in the German Bundesliga on goal difference from Bayer Leverkusen after a 3-1 victory against bottom club Cologne on Sunday.

Paolo Guerrero celebrates after scoring his second goal for Hamburg in the win over Cologne.

Leverkusen had gone three points clear on Saturday night with a 2-1 win against Bochum.

Peru striker Guerrero netted the opening goal against visiting Cologne after being picked out by David Jarolim in the 19th minute.

Bruno Labbadia's Hamburg team needed until the 66th minute before doubling the lead, with Guerrero again giving goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon no chance.

However, winless Cologne pulled one back with a spectacular long-range effort from substitute Adil Chihi before Piotr Trochowski's late penalty wrapped up the points following a foul by Mondragon on midfielder Ze Roberto.

Earlier on Sunday, Werder Bremen moved up to third on goal difference following a 3-2 win at struggling Hertha Berlin.

Bremen joined Schalke and Borussia Monchengladbach on seven points after all five goals were scored in just over half an hour in the second period.

Bremen midfielder Mesut Ozil squandered the best chance of the first half when he hit the post with just goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny to beat, but made amends when he broke the deadlock from a similar situation 12 minutes after the interval.

Tim Borowski doubled the lead on 74 after Drobny failed to hold a shot from Torsten Frings, then the hosts pulled one back with a 20-yard free-kick from Lukasz Piszczek.

Naldo made it 3-1 with seven minutes to go when he headed home from a corner before Patrik Ebert smashed in a brilliant late long-range effort to set up a tense finish.

Meanwhile, Hannover have appointed caretaker manager Andreas Bergmann as coach until the end of the season to replace Dieter Hecking, who resigned two weeks ago.
