(CNN) -- A 64-year-old man already serving a life sentence for the murder of a woman in Georgia was convicted Tuesday of a similar murder in Florida.

The jury in Tallahassee also found Gary Michael Hilton guilty on charges of kidnapping and grand theft in the murder of Cheryl Dunlap, said Florida State Attorney William Meggs.

He was found not guilty of stealing the car belonging to the 46-year-old nurse, whose body was discovered in December 2007 in Apalachicola National Forest, southeast of Tallahassee, Meggs said.

Hilton had previously been convicted of killing Meredith Emerson, a 24-year-old hiker whose naked, decapitated body was found in 2008 in the north Georgia mountains.

Hilton directed authorities to her body and confessed to her kidnapping and murder.
