On Wednesday's edition of CNN Student News we examine the violence in Iraq and the U.S. response to it. We introduce you to the first woman to head the Federal Reserve and take a look at how some are handling the latest blast of super-cold weather. And we dive into a debate over artificial colors in some of your favorite candies.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum and a place for you to leave feedback.
