(CNN) -- Looking for the best hospitals in the United States? U.S. News & World Report has released its annual rankings for 2014 -- with the Mayo Clinic topping the site's honor roll list for the first time.

The yearly analysis specifically looks at the best medical centers for patients with life-threatening or rare conditions. Factors such as patient survival rates, adequate nursing staff, reputation with specialist physicians and patient safety, which has more emphasis this year, are taken into account.

"U.S. News strives to provide patients and their families with the most comprehensive data available on hospitals," said Avery Comarow, U.S. News health rankings editor. "With an estimated 400,000 deaths occurring in hospitals each year from medical errors, measuring safety performance is critical to understanding how well a hospital cares for its patients."
