New York (Cnnmoney.Com) -- Once again, the high-profile Cadillac Escalade SUV is the car that thieves love to steal, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute.

Each year, 10.8 out of every 1,000 late-model Escalades get stolen, broken into, or have parts ripped off. That's the highest rate of theft claims of any vehicle in America. The Escalade has topped the list since 2002. You may have heard that a lot of Toyota Camrys get stolen. They do. But it's only 1.6 out of every thousand.

The institute looked only at cars from the most recent three model years. These cars all have the latest anti-theft technologies, including engine immobilizers that prevent hot-wiring.

"That won't stop a determined thief from loading a car on a flat-bed truck," said Russ Rader, the institute's spokesman.

This list excludes medium-duty work trucks, such as the Ford F-250. It also excludes the Dodge Charger Hemi, which the institute counted as a separate model with a theft rate of 7.1.

If included, those vehicles would have ranked 2nd and 7th, respectively.
