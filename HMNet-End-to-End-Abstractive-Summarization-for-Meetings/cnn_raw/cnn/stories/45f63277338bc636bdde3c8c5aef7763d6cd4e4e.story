(Ars Technica) -- In an attempt to raise awareness of disaster preparedness, the American College of Emergency Physicians has teamed up with casual games publisher and developer Legacy Interactive to create "Disaster Hero.

The game, which is being funded by a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will aim to educate players on the different types of disasters and how to be prepared in the event that they happen.

In the game, players will take on the role of the titular Disaster Hero as he visits different families, helping them prepare for various disasters including earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes.

The game itself will consist of a mish-mash of genres, covering everything from time management and puzzles to quizzes and hidden object scenes.

Players will also get to experience "simulation gameplay," which aims to teach them usable skills, such as applying pressure to stop bleeding.

"This project to develop an educational program for children using a game platform will be a unique approach to teaching kids to have an active role in home disaster planning," ACEP President Dr. Angela Gardner said.

"ACEP is pleased to partner with many other stakeholders representing teachers, schools, daycare centers and youth organizations in the development of this program."

The Web-based game is expected to launch sometime next year.
