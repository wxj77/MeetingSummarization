(CNN) -- The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome will shutter its doors through at least the first quarter of 2011, the commission that runs the facility said Wednesday.

"The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission informed the organizers of every scheduled event through the month of March that the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome will not be available," Bill Lester, executive director of the MSFC, said in a statement.

"It has become increasingly clear that any repair or replacement scenario for the damaged roof will require at least through the month of March to be completed."

Heavy snow that hit the Midwest earlier in December caused a stunning collapse in the roof of the Metrodome.

A full report on the damage and a recommended repair or replacement plan is expected to be completed by the end of January.

The Metrodome is home to the Minnesota Vikings and hosts many other events.
