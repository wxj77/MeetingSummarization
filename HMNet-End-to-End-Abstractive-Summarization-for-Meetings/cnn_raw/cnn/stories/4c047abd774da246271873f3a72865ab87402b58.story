(CNN) -- Viral videos of assaults on a mentally disabled Delaware man have led police to identify two teenage suspects accused in the attack, and a third suspect to turn himself in.

A 14-year-old boy from Newark, Delaware, turned himself in to New Castle County Police Monday night, and officers arrested two other teen boys over the weekend in connection to the assaults. The three teenagers have been charged with misdemeanors, according to department spokesperson Sgt. Jacob Andrews. Because of their age, the youths' names are not being made public.

The beatings occurred several weeks ago, but recently angered viewers across the nation after they were posted on social media using the hashtags #JusticeForCoran and #TheBullyProject.

AS @EriVeronica tweeted: "#JusticeforCoran & Justice for ALL other victims of senseless crime and bullying! Do your part to stop BULLYING, Be KIND. Spread #LOVE!"
