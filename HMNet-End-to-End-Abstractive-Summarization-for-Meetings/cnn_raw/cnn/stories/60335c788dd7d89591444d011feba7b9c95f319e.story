(CNN) -- An Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River in Washington has collapsed, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol said Thursday.

People and cars were in the water.

The bridge is located in a rural area, said Trooper Mark Francis, the spokesman.

Because of that, he said he did not expect mass causalities or injuries. There were no immediate reports of either.

CNN affiliate King 5 News in Seattle broadcast still images of the evening collapse, showing a span of the bridge in the water and crowds nearby.

Images included two people sitting atop vehicles in the water.

It was not immediately clear what caused the collapse, which happened some 60 miles north of Seattle.

The Washington State Department of Transportation will take over the investigation, Francis said.

CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.
