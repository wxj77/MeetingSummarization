(CNN) -- The roof of a shopping mall collapsed in Latvia's capital on Thursday evening, killing four people and trapping dozens of others, officials in the Baltic country said Thursday.

The country's national news agency LETA, citing a government official, reported there were four deaths.

A toddler was among the injured at the Maxima shopping mall, located on Priedaines Street in western Riga's Zolitude neighborhood, according to LETA.

Riga Mayor Nils Usakovs told CNN that authorities think as many as 30 people may be trapped in the building. He said it appeared building materials stored on the roof caused the roof to collapse.

At least 13 fire brigades, a large number of ambulances and the city's mayor arrived at the scene, LETA reported.
