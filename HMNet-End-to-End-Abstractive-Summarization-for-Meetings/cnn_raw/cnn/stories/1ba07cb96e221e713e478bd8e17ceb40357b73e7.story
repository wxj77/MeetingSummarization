(CNN) -- The death of James Gandolfini, best known as Tony Soprano on HBO's "The Sopranos, brought a wave of nostalgia and entrepreneurship to eBay on Wednesday night.

"Newly listed" items populated the online auction site. Vying for top billing were autographed photos, DVDs of the show and even a signed baseball ($149).

Given Soprano's popularity, it brought a new meaning to No. 1, with a bullet.

There was tough guy James Gandolfini with arms crossed on the cover of season one of "The Sopranos." The collection doubled in value before the online gavel fell.

Tough guy James Gandolfini with a pistol had a $55 bid.

And a portrait of tough guy James Gandolfini smoking a cigar was going for 81 bucks.

That photo sold for $261.

A search of eBay and craigslist showed a slew of items -- mostly autographed photos -- marking TV shows and movies in Gandolfini's career.
