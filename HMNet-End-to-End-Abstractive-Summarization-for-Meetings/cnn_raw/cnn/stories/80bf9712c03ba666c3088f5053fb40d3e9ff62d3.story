London, England (CNN) -- A major British supermarket chain plans to start selling Viagra over the counter starting Monday.

The pill, which treats erectile dysfunction, will be available from pharmacies inside 300 Tesco stores across the United Kingdom, to men between 40 and 65, Tesco said.

The men must fill out a questionnaire and be screened for blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol before they can purchase the pills, priced at 52 pounds ($81.50) for a pack of eight. They do not need a doctor's prescription.

Viagra is already available from leading British pharmacy chain Boots, which charges 55 pounds ($86.22) for four pills, said Shona Scott, Tesco's commercial manager for pharmacy services. The decision to stock it in Tesco means it will be available to more men at half the price.

The drug is still prescription-only in the United States, where the Food and Drug Administration has expressed some concerns about sudden hearing loss reported with the pill.
