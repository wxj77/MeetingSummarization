Los Angeles (CNN) -- An unidentified man twice jumped over a fence and into actress Halle Berry's yard this past weekend, a Los Angeles police spokeswoman said Monday.

Berry or her employees called police each time, but no one has been arrested, according to LAPD Officer Sarah Faden.

It's not unusual for photographers to stake out positions around Berry's Los Angeles home to get shots of the Oscar-winning actress, but investigators don't know what this intruder was trying to do, Faden said.

The man was first confronted by a Berry employee after he hopped over the outer fence at 11 a.m. Saturday, she said. He told the staffer he was "there to see somebody," but he left after the employee ordered him out, she said. The police spokeswoman would not reveal who the man said he was looking for.

The same man jumped the same fence at the same time Sunday morning, Faden said. Again, he said he was "there to see somebody." Again, he left when the the staff member told to leave, she said.

Police are looking at security camera video for clues to identify the intruder, she said.
