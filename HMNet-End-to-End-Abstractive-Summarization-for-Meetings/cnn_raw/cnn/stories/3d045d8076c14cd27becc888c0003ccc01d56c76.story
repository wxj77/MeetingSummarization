(CNN) -- The eldest daughter of Walt Disney, Diane Disney Miller, has died at 79, a statement from the museum dedicated to the legendary animated filmmaker said Tuesday.

"She went through life with a determination to inspire and entertain. She was her father's daughter, a creative force with the perseverance to follow dreams and make a difference," the news release said.

Miller died in Napa, California, the result of injuries sustained in a fall. The statement didn't say what day she died and said funeral services will be private.

Miller married Ron Miller in 1954, a year after they met at the University of Southern California. Ron Miller went to work for Walt Disney Studios and later was the CEO of the Walt Disney Company until 1984.

Current Disney CEO Robert Iger said: "(Diane) holds a special place in the history of The Walt Disney Company and in the hearts of fans everywhere. She will be remembered for her grace and generosity and tireless work to preserve her father's legacy, and she will be greatly missed by all who knew her."

Miller was one of the co-founders of the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. At the time of her death, she was the president of the board of directors of the Walt Disney Family Foundation, which owns the 4-year-old museum.

She and her husband also operated Silverado Vineyards in Napa.

She is survived by her husband, seven children, 13 grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Her adopted sister, Sharon Mae Disney, died in 1993.
