(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot, who authorities say has confessed to the murder of a Peruvian woman, faces criminal charges in Alabama because he tried to extort $250,000 from Natalee Holloway's mother, according to an Interpol document.

U.S. authorities last week announced an arrest warrant for van der Sloot on charges of extortion and wire fraud, but they did not name the victim.

In an Interpol document obtained by CNN Wednesday, American authorities ask Peruvian police to arrest van der Sloot and begin a process of extradition to the United States. The document states that Peruvian authorities can hold him if he is facing charges there.

According to the document, around March 29, van der Sloot contacted a representative of Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway.

The Dutch citizen, who was twice arrested in connection with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway but released for lack of evidence, said he would reveal the location of the body and the circumstances surrounding her death for $25,000 in cash. He asked for $250,000 in total, the document states.

Van der Sloot and Beth Holloway's representative met in Aruba, where a payment of $10,000 was made to him, followed by a transfer of $15,000 to a personal bank account in the Netherlands, the document states.

In exchange, van der Sloot showed the representative a house where supposedly Holloway's remains were, according to the document. When records showed that the house wasn't even built at the time of her disappearance, van der Sloot admitted that he lied, Interpol said.
