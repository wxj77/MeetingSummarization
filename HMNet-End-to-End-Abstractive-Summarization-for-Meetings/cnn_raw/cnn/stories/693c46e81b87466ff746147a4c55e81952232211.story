Atlanta (CNN)The daughter of the late singer Whitney Houston, in a medically induced coma after being found unresponsive in January, has been moved to a rehabilitation facility, a source close to the family said Friday.

Bobbi Kristina Brown, 22, had been treated at Emory University Hospital. No details about the transfer to a rehab facility were given.

Brown, Houston's daughter with singer Bobby Brown, was found unresponsive January 31 in a bathtub at her home in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell. The extent of her injuries isn't known.

Last month, doctors at Emory removed her breathing tube, allowing Brown to be ventilated through a hole in her throat.

At the time, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta said the procedure suggested she would need to be on such support for "weeks and months to come."

Police have said they are treating Brown's case as a criminal investigation.

When Houston died in 2012, she was also found in a bathtub. A coroner ruled her death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors.

Brown is Houston's only child.

Brown's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, says he performed CPR after finding Brown in the tub.

Gordon has complained that Brown's family has not allowed him to see her, but Bobby Brown said last month that Gordon simply refused to abide by the family's terms for a visit.
