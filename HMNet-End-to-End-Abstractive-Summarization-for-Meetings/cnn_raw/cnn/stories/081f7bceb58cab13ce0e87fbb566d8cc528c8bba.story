(CNN) -- Julia Roberts, star of the new movie "Eat, Pray, Love," which tells the story of a soul-searching character, is now a practicing Hindu.

Roberts, in an interview with Elle magazine, says she worships with her husband, cameraman Danny Moder, and their three children, People.com says.

The family, she told Elle, goes to temple together to "chant and pray and celebrate. I'm definitely a practicing Hindu." Roberts grew up in Georgia, the daughter of Christian parents.

Other celebrities who have practiced Hinduism include former Beatle George Harrison, author J.D. Salinger and NFL player Ricky Williams.

In her September cover interview, Roberts, 42, decries the use of botox and plastic surgery.

"It's unfortunate that we live in such a panicked, dysmorphic society where women don't even give themselves a chance to see what they'll look like as older persons," she says.

The star of "Pretty Woman" and "Erin Brokovich" also spoke about her relationship with her family.

"You make these people and you love them and you want them around for a thousand years," she said about her three kids -- 3-year-old Henry and 5-year-old twins Phinnaeus and Hazel. "And you want to be there for them for a thousand years."
