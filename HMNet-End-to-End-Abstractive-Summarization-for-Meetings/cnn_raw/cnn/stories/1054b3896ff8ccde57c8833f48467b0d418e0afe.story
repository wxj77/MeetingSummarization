(CNN Student News) -- November 20, 2013

A typhoon in the Philippines and tornadoes in the Midwestern United States: CNN Student News reports on the devastating power of these natural disasters and the long rebuilding processes facing survivors. We also examine why the new U.S. ambassador to Japan holds special significance for some Japanese, and we get a little selfie-centered to discuss Oxford Dictionaries' Word of the Year.
