(CNN) -- Scores of insurgents have been killed over the last day during fighting in southern Afghanistan, the U.S.-led coalition said on Wednesday.

U.S. soldiers pass by Afghan policemen as they stand guard at a checkpoint near the partly-ruined Darlaman Palace in Kabul.

Afghan and coalition troops have killed an estimated 104 insurgents in ongoing fighting since Tuesday morning near the Musa Qalah Wadi in Helmand province, the coalition said.

A coalition service member was killed and four others were wounded in the fighting between troops and Taliban militants.

In neighboring Uruzgan province, a battle between Taliban militants and troops Tuesday left more than 65 insurgents dead in a six-hour battle.

The Afghan-coalition patrol had been near the same spot, northeast of Deh Rawod, where more than three dozen insurgents preparing an ambush were killed last week.

"As with our forces near Musa Qalah, this operation is intended to deny the enemies of peace the use of Deh Rawod as a safe haven," said Army Maj. Chris Belcher, a Combined Joint Task Force-82 spokesman.

"Much like last week's engagement, last night's overwhelming victory by ANSF against the extremists is one more example of this strategy to secure a stable and safe living area for the residents of  province."
