(CNN) -- Charlie Sheen, once TV's highest-paid actor, is offering $1,000 to a waiter who got a 20 cent tip from wealthy football star LeSean McCoy.

Sheen pledged the grand in a tweet to Tommy Up, the owner of Philadelphia's PYT burger joint where McCoy, an Eagles running back, dined Monday afternoon.

The "Anger Management" actor was responding to a controversy cooked up after PYT waiter Rob Knelly noticed the tiny tip, which amounted to just .3% of the $61.76 lunch tab.

Sheen tweeted Wednesday: "dear Tommy Up at PYT in Philly. Please tell Rob K I'm pledging 1000 dollars to him for the tip debacle just wanna help. c #NoJudgement"

The 26-year-old McCoy, who has a $45 million, 5-year contract with Philadelphia's NFL team, has not directly responded to the restaurant's beef, but a local sports reporter quotes him saying "It's bull****, man."

Philadelphia Daily News writer Les Bowen also tweeted "my understanding is, he was really ticked about service. But org wishes he'd handled it differently. He understands"

PYT owner Tommy Up posted the receipt on his Facebook page and tweeted it to the world. Many Eagles fans objected to his apparent effort to shame the popular player -- whose nickname is "Shady."

"I decided to take action after some serious thought," Up wrote on Facebook. "And while I'd like to apologize to Mr McCoy, I cannot in good conscience do so. I stand by my actions one hundred percent."

He disputed the suggestion that McCoy had been given bad service, justifying the minuscule tip. Up said he was sitting nearby watching. "They were given excellent service. Impeccable service. If anything, our server was a little nervous as was our food runner, because they are big, big fans."

The owner accused McCoy and his friends of being "verbally abusive to our staff in the most insulting ways."

As for Charlie Sheen, he tweeted that he was "an American hero and a gentleman."

CNN first learned of Sheen's offer through Twitter.
