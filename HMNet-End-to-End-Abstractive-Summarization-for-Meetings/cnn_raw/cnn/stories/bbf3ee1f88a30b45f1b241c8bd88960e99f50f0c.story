(CNN) -- Not quite the whole sun will come up Sunday along the East Coast of the United States, but the partial solar eclipse will last less than two minutes.

The eclipse will be under way at sunrise. While the moon's shadow will cast a total eclipse over the view of the sun from parts of the Atlantic Ocean and Africa, the sun will look like a half-moon or three-quarter moon when sunrise gets to the American coast.

By the time sunlight reaches as far inland as Atlanta, the eclipse will be just slightly noticeable.

If you try to see the eclipse, be careful not to look at the sun directly. Space.com offers some tips on safe viewing.
