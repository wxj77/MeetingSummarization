(CNN) -- As Europe struggles to recover from crisis, two of its most powerful leaders are meeting to thrash out the next stage.

British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are this week in Sweden, discussing jobs growth and the future of the European Parliament.

The talks come after support for anti-EU parties soared in May's European elections, as frustrated voters turned away from the established political leaders.

Europe's long-term unemployment crisis is high on the agenda of the Stockholm meetings. Youth unemployment in the European Union reached a record high of 23.4% in January, according to Eurostat.

But the European unemployment numbers paint an unequal picture.

Countries like Greece, Spain and Italy have suffered high unemployment rates since the onset of the eurozone crisis, with harsh austerity measures contributing to job losses.

Other countries escaped the worst of the crisis. Explore the map above to find out which countries were hardest hit, and which emerged unscathed.
