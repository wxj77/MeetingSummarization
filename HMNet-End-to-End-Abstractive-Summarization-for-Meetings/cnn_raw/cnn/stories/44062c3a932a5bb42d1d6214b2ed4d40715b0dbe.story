(CNN) -- Continental Airlines has matched Delta Air Lines' recent checked-luggage fee increase, a Continental spokeswoman says.

Delta and Continental passengers paying online for checked bags will be charged $23 for the first bag and $32 for the second.

Delta's online fees are rising by $8 for the first checked bag and $7 for the second. Continental's fees are rising by $5 for each bag.

The new Delta rates start Tuesday and apply to tickets purchased on or after January 5. Passengers who bought tickets before that date will pay the old rates, Delta spokeswoman Susan Elliott said.

Continental matched Delta's updated fees late last week, spokeswoman Mary Clark said. The increase on Continental applies to passengers who purchased tickets on or after January 9 for travel on or after January 16.

Those checking in bags at the airport will shell out even more: $25 for the first bag, $35 for the second on both airlines.

Some passengers -- such as first-class fliers, some frequent fliers and military personnel on deployment -- are exempt from most checked-luggage fees.

Delta and Continental luggage fees now are among the highest in the industry. US Airways also charges $25 for the first checked bag and $35 for the second bag when checked in at the airport. Online, the airline charges $20 and $30 for the first and second bags.

United Airlines charges $20 for the first checked bag and $30 for the second bag at the airport, and $15 and $25 online for the first and second bags, respectively. American Airlines charges $20 for the first checked bag and $30 for the second bag, both online and at the airport.

Most major air carriers started adding checked-bag fees in 2008. The airlines reported collecting nearly $740 million in baggage fees in the third quarter of 2009, according to U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

On discount carrier Southwest Airlines, the first and second checked bags are free. JetBlue offers a free first checked bag and charges $30 for the second.
