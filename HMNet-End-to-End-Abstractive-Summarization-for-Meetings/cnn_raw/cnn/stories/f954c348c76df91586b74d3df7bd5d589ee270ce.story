(CNN) -- A night of revelry and music turned deadly in Northern California, where a man was fatally shot at a Wiz Khalifa concert, police said Saturday.

Authorities first got calls about gunshots at the Shoreline Amphitheatre shortly after 11 p.m. Friday (2 a.m. Saturday ET), the Mountain View, California, Police Department said.

They arrived to find a 38-year-old man shot multiple times. The man was transported to a hospital and died from his injuries, according to police.

The person who killed him remains at large, and authorities are appealing for the public's help to acquire related video or information. Police say the apparent murder weapon was a black pistol with a large magazine.

Wiz Khalifa, the rapper behind platinum hits "Black and Yellow" and "Roll Up," is the headliner for the Under the Influence of Music Tour that rolled into Mountain View on Friday. The tour was scheduled to continue Saturday night in Chula Vista, California, according to his website.

But Wiz Khalifa -- whose real name is Cameron Thomaz -- tweeted the show had been canceled "due to a situation out of our control."

He wrote, "This was a senseless tragedy. Violence is never the answer. My prayers go out to the victim's family."
