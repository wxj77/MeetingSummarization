(CNN Student News) -- Students will examine different proposals to reform the Electoral College and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these proposals.

Procedure

Point out that proposals to reform the Electoral College system are not uncommon, especially after close U.S. presidential elections like the one in 2000. Refer students to the Electoral College One-Sheet and online resources, including those listed, to review arguments for and against the Electoral College system and to examine some of the proposed modifications to the Electoral College. Have students share their findings in a class discussion and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different reform proposals.

Following the discussion, instruct students to draw upon their research to write position papers on whether or not they think that the U.S. electoral system should be reformed, and if so, which reforms make the most sense. Have students share their papers with the class.
