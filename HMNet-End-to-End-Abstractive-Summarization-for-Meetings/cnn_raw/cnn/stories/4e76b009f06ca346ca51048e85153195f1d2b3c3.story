The 'Jewel of Muscat' Omanis' relationship with the sea goes back generations and sailors have traveled and traded on the water for centuries. Inside the Middle East watches the launch of the "Jewel of Muscat," a reconstruction of a 9th century spice ship. The sewn-plank ship has been faithfully reconstructed from handmade coconut fiber ropes and wood -- and without a single nail. The "Jewel of Muscat" will follow old trading routes stopping in India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia before arriving in Singapore in July. Inside the Middle East goes on deck with the captain ahead of the ship's historic launch.

My Beirut with Zuhair Mourad  Drawing inspiration from the blue of the Mediterranean and the green of Lebanon's valleys and mountains, fashion designer Zuhair Mourad has made his name internationally in couture. Mourad most recently made headlines at the Brit Awards red carpet with a gold corset mini-dress worn by singer Florence Welsh who went on to win Best Album. Mourad says he is inspired by the many civilizations that have left their mark on his country -- from Byzantine to Ottoman, from French to "modern Lebanese" -- he shows us around the city where he was raised, Beirut.
