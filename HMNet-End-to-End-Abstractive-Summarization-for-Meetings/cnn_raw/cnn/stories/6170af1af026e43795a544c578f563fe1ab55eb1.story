(CNN) -- Sen. Rand Paul returns to New Hampshire next week, making his third visit to the first-in-the-nation primary state as he prepares for a possible presidential run in 2016.

The Kentucky Republican will appear at a Manchester event on September 11 that's hosted by Generation Opportunity, a libertarian-minded advocacy group for millennials.

Billed as the "First in the Nation Freedom Event," the event takes place at the World Sports Grill.

The next morning Paul plans to attend a New Hampshire GOP breakfast with Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a fellow first-term senator.

Paul was last in New Hampshire in April, in part to speak at a summit hosted by Americans for Prosperity, which is backed by the Koch brothers. He previously went there in May 2013 for an event with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.

The senator's upcoming trip was first reported by Politico.
