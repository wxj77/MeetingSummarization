(CNN) -- On ABC, Thursdays now officially belong to Shonda Rhimes.

As the creator of flagship ABC programs "Grey's Anatomy" and "Scandal," Rhimes has already carved out a two-hour block on Thursdays with those two dramas. But this fall, ABC will air three of Rhimes' shows -- which she co-produces with Betsy Beers -- all in a row.

The network, which announced its 2014-2015 lineup Tuesday, has slated "Grey's Anatomy" for the 8 p.m. hour on Thursdays, to be followed by "Scandal" at 9 p.m. and Rhimes' new drama, "How to Get Away with Murder," at 10 p.m.

The series is set in a law school and stars Viola Davis as the "brilliant, charismatic and seductive" professor of a criminal law class she dubs "How to Get Away with Murder." When Davis' professor becomes involved with four students from her class, the lawyers-in-training realize they have to apply what they've learned to real life.

In addition to that series, ABC is adding five other new programs to its fall lineup, four of which are comedies.

The president of ABC's Entertainment Group, Paul Lee, said in a statement that the network has made an effort to reflect the U.S.'s diversity with its new schedule.

"This season we set out to develop passion projects from world-class storytellers and showcase the faces and voices of America," Lee said. "Both plans unleashed a wave of creativity and we're extremely excited about the new slate."
