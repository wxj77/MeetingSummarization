NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India Friday announced it has banned import of Chinese toys for six months.

The move was announced by India's Directorate General of Foreign Trade of the Commerce Ministry.

The ministry notification gave no reason for the six-month ban effective immediately.

In 2007, there were recalls in the United States of Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amount of lead paint.

Also that year, China suspended export of a bead toy that was contaminated with a "date rape" drug, Chinese media reported. Some children who swallowed the beads vomited and lost consciousness.
