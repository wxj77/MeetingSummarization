There's luxury, and then there's true living.

Catering to the latter, Hard Rock's Provocateur Suite is a palace for those looking to play out bedroom fantasies.

Highlights include two master suites with mirrored ceilings, one of which holds an enormous bed equivalent to three queens and an interactive video wall that, with the flip of a switch, lowers the shades, dims the lights and projects figures "writhing wantonly" on the bed while erotic themes rotate behind the headboard.

Along with a private balcony and plunge pool, the room has a secret vault filled with various toys, gear and outfits, a steel cage large enough for two and a shower with naked silhouettes that react and sway with your every movement.

Another amazing feature: The state of the art media room with custom leather recliners has padded and insulated walls for mind-blowing sound.

But the highlight is the 3,200-square-foot lanai -- touted as the largest on Maui -- with whale watching views of Moloka'i and Lana'i islands, the West Maui Mountains and the Pacific.
