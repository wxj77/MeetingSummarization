(CNN) -- Researchers  at Qatar  University's engineering  school have come up with a novel way to cool the stadiums ahead of the 2022  World Cup... giant flying saucers!

Actually,  they have announced plans to develop giant artificial remotely controlled  "clouds" made up of high-tech materials that will be positioned between the  blistering sun and the still-to-be-built football stadiums in the Gulf emirate.

Dr. Saud  Ghani, head of a Mechanical and Industrial Engineering group at Qatar University, tells CNN that the artificial robotic cloud could potentially drop the  temperatures on the pitch by 10 degrees Fahrenheit.

That's a  big deal in a country where temperatures in summer regularly soar into  triple-digits Fahrenheit -- the very time the 2022 tournament is expected to take  place.

Ghani  says that the design has passed the initial engineering phase and his team plan  to make a 4-by-3 meter prototype by the end of this year to test the  concept.

The  finished product would be a rectangle made up of carbon fiber and solar panels  the size of a jumbo jet.  It would use sophisticated monitoring gear to track  the transit of the sun and would use four electric powered engines to maneuver  to the precisely the right position to drop a cool shade across the  stadiums.

Ghani  believes that the technology could also be useful in security and  communications.  Radio and camera transmitters could help facilitate wireless  communication and provide an eye-in-the-sky for broadcasters or security  forces.

His team  eventually hopes to construct the helium-filled devices in Qatar,  and the final price for each unit could be as low as $500,000,  Ghani  predicted.
