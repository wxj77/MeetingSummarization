(CNN Student News) -- October 3, 2013

In Thursday's program, we hear from some of the key players involved in the debate over the partial U.S. government shutdown. We also dig into the details of Roman-era skulls found in London, and we hear about the conservation efforts some students are making near the Chesapeake Bay. Plus, we meet a shark attack victim whose bionic leg is designed to act more like muscle than metal.
