Los Angeles (CNN) -- Marion "Suge" Knight was arrested Wednesday in Los Angeles on a misdemeanor traffic violation and an outstanding warrant, police said.

The arrest occurred about 12:30 a.m., and the rap music mogul was taken to the Los Angeles County Jail, where he was held on $20,000 bail, said Officer Cleon Joseph, who did not have details about the warrant or the violation.

The 48-year-old music mogul has had previous run-ins with the law.

In February 2012, Las Vegas police stopped Knight, who was driving a black Bentley, and said they found less than an ounce of marijuana in the vehicle. He was ticketed for making an unsafe lane change.

In December 2010, Knight was arrested at a suburban Los Angeles outdoor shopping mall for failing to appear in court on a traffic violation.

At the time, the co-founder of Death Row Records had a warrant issued for failure to appear in court.

Knight rose to fame and fortune after founding his record label in 1991 and signing artists who included Snoop Doggy Dogg (who now goes by the name Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was in Las Vegas with Shakur in 1996 when the rapper was shot to death.

Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time, along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others, contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006.
