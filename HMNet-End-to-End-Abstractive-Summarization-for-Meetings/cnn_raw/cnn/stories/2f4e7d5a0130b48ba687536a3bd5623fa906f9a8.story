(CNN)Kurt Busch, the 2004 NASCAR top series champion, has been suspended indefinitely from NASCAR events, the auto racing circuit said Friday.

The suspension comes after a court determined Busch committed an act of domestic violence against his former girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, NASCAR officials told CNN.

"Given the serious nature of the findings and conclusions made by the Commissioner of the Family Court of the State of Delaware, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch, effective immediately," NASCAR said in a news release.

Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said in a written statement that his client will immediately appeal NASCAR's decision.

"We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold," Hardin said.

NASCAR will expedite any appeal, NASCAR Executive Vice President Steve O'Donnell told reporters.

"NASCAR has made it very clear to our entire membership ... that any actions of abuse will not be tolerated," O'Donnell said.

The racing season officially begins Sunday with the Daytona 500. Busch could still race if his suspension is overturned in the appeals process.

Busch was accused by Driscoll of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times while they were in Busch's motor home at Dover International Speedway in October. The judge in the civil case found her story to be true, ESPN reported. Hardin's statement said Driscoll had lied during her testimony and she had tried to intimidate witnesses.

In 2004, Busch captured the Cup series title, winning NASCAR's first postseason 10-race tournament.
