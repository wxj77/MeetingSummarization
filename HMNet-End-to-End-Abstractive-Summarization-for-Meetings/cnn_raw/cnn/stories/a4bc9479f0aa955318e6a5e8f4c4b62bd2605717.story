(CNN) -- A Georgia man accused of screaming racial slurs while beating an African-American female Army reservist outside a restaurant was released from jail on bail Wednesday, Clayton County, Georgia, authorities said.

They said Troy Dale West Jr. was released on a $320,000 bond.

Attorney Kip Jones, who represents alleged victim Tashawnea Hill, said a judge Tuesday ordered West placed under house arrest, and he was fitted with an ankle monitor.

He also was told to surrender his passport, have no contact with Hill and stay out of Clayton County, where Hill lives, the lawyer said.

West, of Poulan, Georgia, faces one count of aggravated assault, two counts of battery, two counts of disorderly conduct, false imprisonment and cruelty to children for allegedly beating Hill outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant September 9, according to a Clayton County Court online docket.

Hill was with her 7-year-old daughter when the alleged incident occurred at the entrance to the restaurant, which is in Morrow, Georgia.

West, 47, was arrested on misdemeanor charges after the incident, but Clayton County District Attorney Tracy Graham Lawson took the case to a grand jury asking for more serious charges.

Hill, 35, said the attack occurred after she warned West to be careful, after almost hitting her daughter with the restaurant door as she was leaving.

West, according to a police report, admitted striking Hill "after she spit on me and accused me of trying to hit her daughter with a door."

Hill denied the accusations, saying she did nothing to provoke the alleged attack.

Hill told police that West, who is white, yelled racial epithets at her during the attack. Police said witnesses confirmed her account.

Morrow is a racially diverse city in the southeast suburbs of Atlanta, with a population of about 4,900, according to the 2000 census.
