Omagh, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- A Catholic police officer was killed in a blast on Saturday in Northern Ireland, said police and politicians at the scene.

Police said an explosive device detonated under a car in the Highfield Close area of Omagh, Northern Ireland, in the afternoon.

The victim -- Ronan Kerr -- was 25 years old and had recently joined the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

"Tonight, tragedy has returned to Omagh," PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott told reporters. "I have no words to describe the awfulness of this afternoon, and my abhorrence and anger at this wasted life. And I know that anger and abhorrence is shared by all decent people in Northern Ireland and across Ireland and across the world."

Thirteen years ago, a bombing in Omagh killed 29 people and wounded more than 300.

"This heinous crime will not succeed in its evil intent of destroying the peaceful and democratic future to which the people of Northern Ireland are so clearly committed," said Irish President Mary McAleese. "My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and colleagues at this time."

The head of the Catholic church in Ireland, Cardinal Sean Brady, similarly condemned the killing.

"The deliberate taking of innocent human life is always wrong," he said. "I implore the perpetrators of this shameful killing to realise the futility of their actions, and to call off this senseless campaign."

Northern Ireland was the scene of frequent violence between pro-Irish and pro-British forces over a period of three decades. About 3,000 people were killed before a power-sharing deal known as the Good Friday Agreement was reached in 1998. Some dissident groups remain active.
