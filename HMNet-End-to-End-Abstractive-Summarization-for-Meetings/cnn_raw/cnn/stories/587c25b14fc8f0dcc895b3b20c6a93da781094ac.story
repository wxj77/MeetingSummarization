(CNN) -- A video showing a blind man being repeatedly kicked and stomped by an unknown assailant was released by the Philadelphia Police Department Tuesday.

The 33-year-old victim was walking down the street around noon on October 2 in Philadelphia's Southwest Germantown neighborhood when the suspect looked in his direction as he was approaching, according to police.

The grainy police surveillance video shows the suspect laying down his backpack near a corner shop after he spots the victim.

The video goes black, and the next moment shows the victim being pushed to the ground and repeatedly punched, stomped on and then kicked about four times by his attacker as witnesses watched.

One man is seen crossing the street mere steps from the beating, and he continues walking.

After the suspect finishes assaulting the blind man, he picks up his backpack and walks away, leaving the victim helpless on the ground with injuries to his head and face, according to police.

Philadelphia police spokeswoman Officer Tanya Little said it was not clear whether the suspect knew that the victim was blind. The victim told police he did not recognize his attacker's voice.

Police are asking the public to help identify the attacker, whom they described as a 20-year-old black man wearing a tan baseball cap, tan shirt and khaki pants.
