(CNN) -- Marc Marquez raced to his third straight pole position of the 2014 MotoGP World Championship at the Termas de Rio Honda circuit in Argentina on Saturday.

The Repsol Honda rider produced a lap of one minute, 37.683s, trumping Yamaha's two-time MotoGP champion, Jorge Lorenzo, by 0.742 seconds.

Marquez will now look to maintain his 100% record in the full race on Sunday after winning the first two meets of the season in Doha and Austin.

"Today I really felt good on the bike and I am happy to have taken pole position," a smiling Marquez told the MotoGP website.

"In the morning and in FP4, we worked a lot with the used tire and this afternoon we obviously focused on qualifying. I put in a very good lap and I am happy," he added.

The Spaniard, who was also the quickest in all of the practice sessions, was the only rider to break the 1.37s barrier all day.

Lorenzo improved significantly in the final stages of qualifying but his best lap of one minute, 38.651 seconds was only enough to qualify in second place.

Marquez's Honda teammate, Dani Pedrosa, finished 0.226 seconds back on Lorezo to pick up the final place on the front row.

The second row will contain Pol Espargaro of Yamaha, Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso and nine-time champion Valentino Rossi, also of Yamaha.

The race at the Termas circuit is the first MotoGP event to be held in Argentina in 15 years.
