(CNN)For a pop star with millions of frenzied fans, Taylor Swift does a pretty good job keeping tabs on them.

She has a history of stalking -- er, "Tay-lurking" -- fans on social media, figuring out their likes, dislikes and what's going on in their lives. And she loves to shower super loyal ones with some enormous gifts.

But the package that Rebekah Bortniker received may be one of the most complicated presents yet.

The giant box, labeled "SwiftEx" instead of "FedEx," contained so many meticulously wrapped gifts that it took Bortniker several minutes to open them all.

"Hi you. I was thinking about you today, and how you have been there cheering me on in the most thoughtful and creative ways," the singer wrote on a card.

"I'm not a good painter but I think you're so beautiful and positive, even though you're dealing with the stress life brings, so I wanted to make you something."

Yep, the Grammy winner sent a custom-made floral painting to her fan. She even sent a Polaroid of herself doing so as proof.

Then there was a necklace. "Was mine, now yours," Swift explained.

Finally, a gift to help ease Bortniker's student loan debt.

"Rebekah, now you're $1989 closer to paying off those student loans," Swift wrote. 1989, of course, isn't just Swift's birth year -- it's the name of her latest album and world tour.

By this point, Bortniker could barely speak from all the emotion.

"I don't even know what to say," she managed to say.

Fortunately she has time to think of a response before September -- when she'll be at two of Swift's concerts.
