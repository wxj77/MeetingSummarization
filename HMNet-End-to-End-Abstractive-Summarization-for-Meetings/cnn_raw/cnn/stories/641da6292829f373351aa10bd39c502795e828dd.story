(CNN) -- A New York-bound plane left Madrid-Barajas Airport in Spain only to return, where it ran off the runway but did not crash, an airport spokesman said. There are no reported injuries.

The pilot of Delta flight 415, which was headed to JFK International, reported to the control tower there was a mechanical problem with the Boeing jet and requested to return to the airport. The plane is on a taxiway being inspected and repaired.

Spanish newspaper El Pais reported the problem was related to the hydraulic system.

Delta Air Lines issued a statement saying the plane turned around "for precautionary reasons."

"The flight landed normally and the passengers deplaned normally," it said.

Asked whether the plane went off the runway, a Delta spokeswoman said she couldn't comment beyond the statement.

The airline has put most, if not all, of the passengers in hotels, she said.
