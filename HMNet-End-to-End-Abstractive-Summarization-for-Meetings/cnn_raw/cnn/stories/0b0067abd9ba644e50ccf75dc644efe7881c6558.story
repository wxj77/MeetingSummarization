(CNN) -- Zambia's incumbent president bowed out with "grace and honor" Friday after election results showed his main challenger had won, his party said in a statement.

"The people of Zambia have spoken and we must listen," outgoing President Rupiah Banda said on the website of his Movement for Multiparty Democracy. "The time now is for maturity, for composure and for compassion."

Zambians voted Tuesday in the presidential election.
