(CNN) -- Victoria Azarenka surrendered just three games to Samantha Stosur as she claimed her third title of an impressive year at the Qatar Open.

The world No. 1 wrapped up a 6-1 6-2 victory over her Australian opponent, showing no sings of discomfort from the injury that she picked up in Saturday's semifinal win over Agnieszka Radwanska

The Belarusian's win in Doha was her 17th straight victory this year, a run that has seen her capture the Syndey International crown and a first grand slam title at the Australian Open in January.

It was her 11th career title and cements Azarenka's place as the dominant force in women's tennis in 2012.

Last year in Doha, she lost in the opening round to Daniela Hantuchova -- a defeat that caused her to contemplate quitting the sport.

"I am really proud of the way I played today," an emotional Azarenka said in an interview courtside. "I was not 100 per cent after my fall yesterday and I knew I had to adjust my game and everything went according to plan.

"Last year I lost in the first round and watched someone else lift this beautiful trophy. But now I have this for myself."

Azarenka rarely looked in any danger against Stosur, the reigning U.S. Open champion, breaking her opponent three times in the opening set.

Stosur continued to make unforced errors in the second set, Azarenka racing into a 3-0 lead.

Though the Australian retained two service games, another break sealed the third title of Azarenka's year.
