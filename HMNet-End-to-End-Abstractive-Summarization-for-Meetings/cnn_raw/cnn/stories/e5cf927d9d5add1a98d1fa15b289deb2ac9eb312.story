(CNN) -- Keeping a sense of mystery is 2014's definition of sexy, at least according to Esquire magazine.

The men's publication has named Penelope Cruz, one of Hollywood's most notoriously private stars, as this year's "Sexiest Woman Alive."

Cruz follows in the footsteps of previous winners like Scarlett Johansson, Mila Kunis and Rihanna.

But being the newly crowned "Sexiest Woman Alive" hasn't made Cruz any more revealing. She has one drama, "Ma ma," set to bow this year in Spain, and is filming the comedy "Grimsby" with Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher. The Oscar winner was tight-lipped about both projects with Esquire and was similarly elusive about her relationship with fellow actor Javier Bardem.

The couple tied the knot in 2010 and now have a 3-year-old son and a 1-year-old daughter, but neither star has been eager to share details of parenthood.

"That is for us," Cruz explained to Esquire, adding that her family's the reason you don't often see her in the public eye.

As far as her new title of "Sexiest Woman Alive," Cruz was just as tight-lipped. She feels more "like a mother who doesn't get enough sleep," Esquire says, than the magazine's newest title-holder.

But on the other hand, "assume a virtue, if you have it not."
