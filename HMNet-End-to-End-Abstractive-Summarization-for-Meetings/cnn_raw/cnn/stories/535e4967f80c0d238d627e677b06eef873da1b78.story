(CNN) -- Actress Misty Upham, whose body was found in October along a river in suburban Seattle, died from blunt force injuries to her head and torso, the King County Medical Examiner said Thursday.

The manner of her death has not yet been determined, the medical examiner's office said.

Investigators found Upham's body during a search for the missing actress. It lay at the bottom of a steep embankment near the White River.

Upham, 32, was last seen alive October 5 walking from her sister's apartment, according to a statement sent to media outlets by her father, Charles Upham. Authorities say she died that day, but it wasn't until more than a week later that investigators found her body.

Her father said she had bipolar disorder and bouts of depression and anxiety, but he didn't think she was suicidal. Police have said they don't have evidence of foul play.

Upham had small roles in "Django Unchained" and "August: Osage County," and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for her performance in 2008's "Frozen River." She's also had roles in the TV series "Big Love" and the TV movie "Skinwalkers."

CNN's Todd Leopold and Brandon Griggs contributed to this report.
