Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo arrived Tuesday in Libya following the weekend capture of Moammar Gadhafi's son and the late Libyan leader's intelligence chief, the ICC said.

Moreno-Ocampo said that Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and Abdullah al-Senussi -- suspects in crimes against humanity -- "must face justice."

Moreno-Ocampo said Libya was obliged to cooperate with the court under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970.

"This is not a military or political issue; it is a legal requirement," he said.

Libyan authorities have said they want to try Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, once his father's heir apparent, in Libya.

But Moreno-Ocampo suggested the matter was not settled.

"The issue of where the trials will be held has to be resolved through consultations with the court. In the end, the ICC judges will decide. There are legal standards which will have to be adhered to," he said.

Moreno-Ocampo and ICC deputy prosecutor Fatou Bensouda are due to meet with Libyan authorities to "understand their plans moving ahead," the prosecutor said.

Meanwhile, two delegates from the International Committee of the Red Cross met with Saif al-Islam Gadhafi in the western town of Zintan on Tuesday, spokesman Steven Anderson told CNN.

"We are currently conducting visits to detainees in Libya, and this was part of these visits," Anderson said.

"Saif al-Islam Gadhafi appeared to be in good health and not in any harm. At this stage we do not have any indications with regards him being tried in Libya or handed over to the ICC."

Anderson said the Red Cross had not yet met with al-Senussi and had no indication of when it might.

As Libyans continue to transition after Moammar Gadhafi's fall, Abdurrahim El-Keib, Libya's acting prime minister, is expected to submit a Cabinet lineup for approval to the National Transitional Council on Tuesday.

CNN's Claudia Rebaza and Alexander Felton contributed to this report.
