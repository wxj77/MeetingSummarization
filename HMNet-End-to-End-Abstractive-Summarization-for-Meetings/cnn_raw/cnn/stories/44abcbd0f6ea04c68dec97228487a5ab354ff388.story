(Mashable) -- Apple is scheduled to host an education-related event on January 19 -- shrouded with a veil of mystery, as always. A new report from Ars Technica says the company is about to unveil a set of tools to create interactive e-books.

Previous rumors said that Apple will show no new devices, and that the event will center around Apple's new partnerships with textbook publishers.

If this new report is true, the event might turn out to be much more significant. Ars Technica's sources say Apple's about to present new authoring tools described as "GarageBand for e-books," making it easy for everyone to create interactive digital books.

The company also plans to expand its platform to distribute these e-books to iPhone and iPad users.

Apple, who currently supports the ePub 2 e-book standard (with some additions) is also expected to announce support for the ePub 3 standard for iBooks.

This venture is described as the pet project of Steve Jobs, who -- according to Walter Isaacson's biography -- believed the textbook industry is ripe for "digital destruction." According to Ars Technica's sources, Jobs was very closely involved on the project and has worked on it for several years.
