(CNN)Oregon State University's main library just went viral, and not because of its state-of-the-art computer lab.

A 19-year-old woman was cited Tuesday evening for allegedly using the university library at the campus in Corvallis, Oregon, as a backdrop to shoot an adult video last year.

The woman was cited for public indecency and released, according to Steve Clark, Oregon State vice president of university relations. She is not a current student but attended the school for the 2014 fall term.

The former student's name was not released by the school, but an Oregon State Police log says that 19-year-old Kendra Jane Sunderland of Corvallis was cited for public indecency in connection with a video posted to a pornographic site along with the claim that it was shot in an Oregon State library.

The log says the performer in the video engaged in a "solo act."

The misdemeanor charge could bring up to one year in jail and a $6,250 fine.

CNN's attempts to reach Sunderland for comment weren't immediately successful.

Clark said the university learned about the video Tuesday afternoon. Officials believe the video, which was published on the popular adult website Pornhub.com, was filmed in October on the sixth floor of OSU's Valley Library.

"The university does not condone such behavior. This type of behavior does not represent the values of the university. And it definitely does not represent the values of the more than 30,000 students and 5,000 employees that make up Oregon State University," said Clark.

Valley Library occupies more than 340,000 square feet and is routinely patrolled by members of the Department of Public Safety and Oregon State Police troopers as well as by two security guards, who patrol the library during overnight hours.â€‹
