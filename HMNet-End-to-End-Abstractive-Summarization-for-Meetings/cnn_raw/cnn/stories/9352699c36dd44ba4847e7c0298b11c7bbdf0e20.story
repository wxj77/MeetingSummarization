London, England (CNN) -- AB de Villiers has broken the South African record for the highest individual score in a test innings with an unbeaten 278 against Pakistan in the second Test match at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.

Debutant Tanvir Ahmed was the pick of Pakistan's bowlers finishing with figures of 6 for 120.

In reply, Pakistan got off to the worst possible start losing opener Mohammad Hafeez, trapped lbw to Dale Steyn, to the third ball of their innings.

Pakistan managed to avoid any further scares before close of play, finishing on 59 for 1 with Taufeeq Umar (16) and Azhar Ali (34) still at the crease, but still trail South Africa by 525 runs.

The home side finished on 292 for 2 after they bowled out New Zealand for 193 earlier in the day, giving them a first innings lead of 99 runs.

The tourists could only add 45 runs to their overnight total of 148 for 7. Ishant Sharma finished with figures of 4 for 43 after claiming two of the three remaining wickets to fall in the morning session.

India's openers Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag got off to a flier passing 50 in the eighth over.

Both men recorded half centuries before Daniel Vettori bagged a catch off his own bowling to remove Sehwag for 74 in the 23rd over.

Gambhir made a patient 78 before edging a catch to Ross Taylor at slip off the bowling of Tim Southee.

But Rahul Dravid (69 not out) and Sachin Tendulkar (57 not out) steadied the ship, adding 100 for the third wicket before the close.
