Washington (CNN) -- How many people died of marijuana overdoses last year?

"Spoiler alert -- it's zero!" said Oregon Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer, putting his hands over his head in the shape of a zero.

The comments were made at an event Thursday with a bipartian group of House members calling for Congress to jump on the bandwagon of marijuana legalization initiatives passed in Oregon, Alaska and D.C. on Election Day. Colorado passed a similar ballot initiative in 2012.

Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton from, D-D.C., Dana Rohrabacher, R- California and Jared Polis, D-Colordao, were also at the event touting the health and economic benefits of legal marijuana.

"There were many close elections across America last week, but there was one clear winner: ending our failed prohibition of marijuana, and instead legalizing, regulating, and taxing adult use," Blumenauer said. "It's not more dangerous than methamphetamines or cocaine." "Or tequila," Rohrabacher jumped in.

Marijuana legalization in the District requires approval from Congress, which is still pending. Norton said that newly elected D.C. Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser is unsure about how Congress will react.

"I think she has some concerns about what Congress will do," Norton said. "We have to do it in a way so that we don't become the place to come for pot."
