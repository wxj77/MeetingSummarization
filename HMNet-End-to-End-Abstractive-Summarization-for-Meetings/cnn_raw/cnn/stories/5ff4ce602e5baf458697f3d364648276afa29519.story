(CNN) -- Want to get killed off in a "Game of Thrones" book?

"Game of Thrones" author George R.R. Martin is offering just that chance to help raise money for the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot in Sante Fe, New Mexico. Fans who visit his page on celebrity fundraising site Prizeo can make a donation and be entered to win a trip for two to New Mexico where they'll ride a helicopter tour the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary with Martin.

Donation levels range from $10 to $20,000 and the larger to gift the more opportunity there is to receive goodies. For example, $100 gets a donor a campaign T-shirt and a thank you video. $4,500 could yield a script of the first ever episode signed by the cast and crew and $7,500 snags a pair of tickets to the Season 5 premiere of the "Game of Thrones" television series.

But the biggest prize goes to the first fans with deep pockets to ante up.

For $20,000, one male and one female character will be named after the donor in a future novel with the author promising the character will "certainly meet a grisly death."

If you have read his books or watched the show, you know he means it.
