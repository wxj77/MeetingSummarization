1. detainment

2. lunar probe

3. unmanned aerial vehicle ("drone")

Fast Facts: How well were you listening to today's program?

1. What did people in the report say about a recent train derailment in New York City? What are some possible factors that officials are investigating?

2. What is known about two Americans detained by North Korea? According to former U.N. ambassador Bill Richardson, what action has North Korea taken with regard to American detainees in the past? What does Richardson say about the current situation?

3. What countries have successfully landed unmanned spacecraft on the moon? Which country has launched a lunar space probe in an attempt to join this group? How would you describe the lunar rover being used for this mission?

Discussion Questions:

1. What challenges might the international community face in its relations with a secretive nation, such as North Korea? What options might be available to the U.S. in obtaining the release of two detained Americans?

2. Why might a country want to send a spacecraft to the moon? (What significance might such a mission carry for a nation?) What might be the challenges of a moon mission? Why do you think relatively few countries have tried to accomplish this feat?

3. Can you think of other uses for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) like the ones Amazon proposes using to ship packages? What might be the potential benefits and drawbacks of this kind of technology?
