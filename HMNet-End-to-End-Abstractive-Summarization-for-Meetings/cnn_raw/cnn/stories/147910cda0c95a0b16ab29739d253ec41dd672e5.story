Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man arrested at Sandra Bullock's Los Angeles home allegedly was inside for more than an hour before police were called early Sunday.

Joshua James Corbett, 39, also owned an illegal machine gun, although he did not have it with him when he allegedly broke into the actress's home, a Los Angeles prosecutor said Tuesday.

Corbett, from Montrose, California, was charged Tuesday with felony counts of residential burglary, stalking and possession of a machine gun, according to Deputy District Attorney Wendy Segall.

Corbett entered a not guilty plea during a brief court appearance Tuesday afternoon. The judge set his bond at $185,000.

Corbett allegedly climbed a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire to enter Bullock's West Los Angeles property and enter her home at about 5 a.m. Sunday, according to Segall. Bullock was home at the time, but police have not said whether her young son also was there.

Los Angeles police said they were not called to the home until 6:30 a.m., suggesting that the alleged burglar was inside for more than an hour while the actress slept.

LAPD officers responding to a "hot prowler" call found Corbett outside of the house, but on the property, according to a police spokeswoman.

The prosecutor would not give details about where investigators found the machine gun, saying only Corbett "was not in possession of the machine gun at the time of the break-in."

No other information about Corbett has been released, although CNN confirmed through FAA records that he has a private pilot's license.

CNN has been unable to identify a lawyer for Corbett.

The charges carry a potential maximum seven years and four months in prison, if the suspect is convicted, Segall said.

Bullock, who also has a home in Texas, was in Los Angeles over the weekend to receive the "Decade of Hotness Award" at the Guys Choice Awards. Her representatives did not respond to CNN requests for comment.
