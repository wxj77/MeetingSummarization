(CNN) -- Moments after crossing the line, the new marathon world record holder Wilson Kipsang had just one thought on his mind -- "I can run faster".

The Kenyan athlete smashed the record for the 26.2 mile slog by a huge 15 seconds on the streets of the German capital of Berlin.

Kipsang set a new mark of two hours, three minutes and 23 seconds Sunday to beat the time set by his compatriot Patrick Makau on the same course two years ago.

"This is a dream come true," said Kipsang, who won the bronze medal in the men's marathon at the 2012 London Olympic Games.

"I was feeling strong so I decided to push. I'm very happy that I've won and at breaking the world record.

"There was a lot of wind, I was really fighting. I still think I have the potential to run faster - anything under 2:03.23 would do."

Kipsang was born in Kenya's Keiyo District, an area popular for high altitude training, but it was on the fast streets of Berlin that he achieved his lifelong ambition.

His marathon world record was the ninth set in the German capital and the eighth over the marathon course in the last 15 years.

In the women's marathon in Berlin, there was more Kenyan success as Florence Kiplagat took the tape ahead of Sharon Cherop.
