(CNN) -- This month, the Road to Rio is making a stop in the U.S. state of California to discover what cities are doing there to cut carbon emissions. CNN's Isha Sesay, Thelma Gutierrez and special correspondent Philippe Cousteau seek out the best green innovations in Los Angeles, including variety of new car technologies, a bicycle kitchen and smog eating tile.

From there, Philippe Cousteau heads to northern California to check out how artists are giving garbage a whole new form and sense of respect. Then he heads to a community that is producing as much energy as it's using in Davis, California. Finally, his assignment really gets tough as he heads to Napa Valley to see how wineries are getting a green makeover. 

Meanwhile, Thelma Gutierrez visits one of the largest landfills in the country to see first hand exactly where our garbage is going. And Isha Sesay gets a behind-the-scenes tour of Warner Brothers studios to witness the newest green innovations they're implementing.
