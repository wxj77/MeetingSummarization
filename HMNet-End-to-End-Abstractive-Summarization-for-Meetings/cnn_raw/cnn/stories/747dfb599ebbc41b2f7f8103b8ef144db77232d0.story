(CNN) -- Google has updated its Maps app, rolling the new-ness out now to Android devices and coming soon to Apple portables. Aside from a few new features, Maps will sport tablet-optimized versions for the iPad and Android slates.

One of the most helpful additions in this most recent update is intelligent re-routing based on current traffic conditions. According to Google's blog post:

"In addition to current traffic conditions, we've added two new features to help you navigate around traffic. You can now see reports of problems on the road that you can tap to see incident details. While on the road, Google Maps will also alert you if a better route becomes available and reroute you to your destination faster. This feature is available only on Android and is coming soon to iOS."

Google is also leveraging its Zagat purchase and its Offers product to serve up restaurant reviews and discounts to nearby places. In addition, Google's friend finder and Foursquare-like Latitude feature is being retired, but similar functionality will be folded into Google+.

Says Google:

"One important change you should know about is that Latitude and check-ins are no longer part of the new Google Maps app, and will be retired from older versions on August 9. We understand some of you still want to see your friends and family on a map, which is why we've added location sharing and check-ins to Google+ for Android (coming soon to iOS)."
