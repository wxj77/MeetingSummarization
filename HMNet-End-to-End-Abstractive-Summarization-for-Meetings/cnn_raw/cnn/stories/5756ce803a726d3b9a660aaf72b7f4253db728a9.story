(CNN) -- African champions TP Mazembe Englebert are through to the semifinals of the World Club Cup in Abu Dhabi after a 1-0 victory over Mexican side Pachuca.

The Congolese side secured a last four showdown with South American champions Internacional, courtesy of Mbenza Beli's first-half strike, despite playing the final nine minutes with just 10 men.

Pachuca nearly took the lead in the 19th minute when Alejandro Manso's left-foot volley bounced back off the post.

But, just two minutes later, it was Mazembe who struck the only goal of the game when Bedi lashed the ball home after being put through by Mulota Kabangu.

Beli had scored Mazembe's only goal in last year's tournament, in the 2-1 defeat by Pohang Steelers, but this time his side managed to hold on despite a second-half Pachuca onslaught.

And they achieved that feat despite playing the closing stages a man down, after Stoppila Sunzu was sent off following a second yellow card offense.

Korean side Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma will next face local favorites Al-Wahda for the right to play European champions Inter Milan in the other semifinal showdown.
