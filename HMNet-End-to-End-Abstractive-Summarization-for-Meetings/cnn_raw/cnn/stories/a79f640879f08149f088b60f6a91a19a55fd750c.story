(CNN) -- YouTube has made another match for a U.S. Marine looking to score a date to the Marine Corps Ball.

Justin Timberlake said Friday that he will accept an invitation extended through a YouTube video by Cpl. Kelsey de Santis.

"If my schedule works out to do it, I'd love to do it. It's an honor," Timberlake said at a media event to promote the film "Friends with Benefits."

De Santis made the video after Timberlake's "Friends with Benefits" co-star Mila Kunis received a similar invitation from a Marine serving in Afghanistan.

"If you can't go, all I have to say is 'Cry Me a River,' " De Santis, flanked by a contingent of tough-looking male Marines, said on the video, referencing one of Timberlake's hit songs.

Timberlake joked that he was not accepting "because she shouted out one of my songs, which I love," but because "I don't get asked out ever, so I was very flattered by that."

His acceptance comes one day after Kunis addressed rumors that work would keep her from her date, despite saying she would attend Sgt. Scott Moore's YouTube invitation to attend the Marine Corps Ball in Greenville, North Carolina.

"I will happily clear it up, once and for all," Kunis said Thursday. "Never did I say that I was not going. ... I am attending. I'm going. November 18 I will be there."

If Timberlake follows through on his acceptance, he will attend the November 12 Marine Corps Ball in Washington, D.C.
