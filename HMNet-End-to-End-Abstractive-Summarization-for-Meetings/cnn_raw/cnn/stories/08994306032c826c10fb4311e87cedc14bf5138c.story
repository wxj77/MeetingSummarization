Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two men were arrested in southern Pakistan this week on suspicion of trying to smuggle a batch of heroin disguised as onions out of the country, authorities said.

Officials seized 125 kilograms (276 pounds) of heroin Wednesday during the incident in Karachi, said Meraj Mohammad Channa, a customs official.

The suspects made the drugs look like onions by using paint and plastic and then stashed them in bags of real onions, Channa said.

The drugs and vegetables were set to be shipped to Malaysia until customs officials inspected the shipment.

Two men were arrested and authorities were looking for one more suspect, Channa said.
