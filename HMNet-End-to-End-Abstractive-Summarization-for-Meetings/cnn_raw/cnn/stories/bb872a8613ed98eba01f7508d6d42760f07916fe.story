(CNN) -- Samuel Eto'o scored his 17th goal in 16 games but his controversial penalty could only salvage a 1-1 home draw for Italian champions Inter Milan against Brescia in the San Siro on Saturday.

Andrea Caracciolo put newly-promoted Brescia in front in the first half, but it was canceled out by Eto'o's strike after the break.

The Cameroon international went down himself in the penalty area as he tussled with Gaetano Berardi, but the award of the spot-kick was met with disbelief by the visiting players.

The disappointing draw leaves Inter three points adrift of leaders Lazio, who are playing Roma in the capital derby on Sunday.

Inter came into the match off the back of a 3-1 reverse to Tottenham Hotspur and with coach Rafael Benitez having to shuffle his pack after injuries to key players.

But striker Diego Milito was able to start his first game for over a month and was soon involved as he shot just wide.

Brescia were ahead on 14 minutes as Caracciolo slipped the ball under home keeper Luca Castellazzi.

Eto'o, who is in the form of his life, twice came close to an equalizer and then set up Goran Pandev for a chance he spurned from close range.

Inter lost Maicon and Walter Samuel to injury after the break and struggled for an equalizer before they won their penalty on 73 minutes.

TV replays appeared to indicated Eto'o had trod on the ball as he went down, but Benitez said the award was fair.

"From the bench it seemed a penalty to me," he told AFP.

Milito shot over in injury time from a great position, but defeat would have been harsh on Brescia.

In other Serie A action on Saturday, Bologna moved out of the relegation zone with a 2-0 win over Lecce with Marco Di Vaio and Henry Gimenez scoring in the final six minutes.
