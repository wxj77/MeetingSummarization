(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao will take a slight weight advantage into his fourth fight with Mexico's Juan Manuel Marquez in Las Vegas Saturday.

The Filipino tipped the scales right on the 147lb welterweight limit in the weigh-in at the MGM Grand Hotel Friday with Mexico's Marquez coming in at 143lb.

In front of a vociferous crowd, the pair did not exchange words as they completed the formalities, posing for pictures before the ritual eyeball to eyeball confrontation.

Marquez, 39, is seeking his first win in a classic series of bouts stretching over eight years.

The first was a draw, with Pacquiao claiming narrow victories on points in the other two, including a controversial decision 13 months ago.

"We know each other really well and it's going to be a war," predicted Marquez after the weigh-in.

"It is most important to show people who the best man is," Marquez added.

The 33-year-old Pacquiao, 54-4-2 with 38 knockouts, lost his last fight to Timothy Bradley back in June, himself falling victim to a disputed decision over 12 rounds.

He is anxious to get his career back on track, with the prospect of a showdown with American superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. still eagerly awaited by boxing fans.

Pacquiao, who is an elected congressman in his native Philippines, voiced his concerns about the effects of Typhoon Bopha which has swept through his country with a reported death toll exceeding 500 people.

"This fight is dedicated to them," he said.

But his words were drowned out by the Mexican supporters for Marquez, who is 54-6-1 with 39 KOs in his lengthy career.

The undercard will feature a 12-round IBF lightweight title bout between Mercito Gesta of the Philippines and Mexican Miguel Vazquez, but the main bout is a non-title clash.
