(CNN) -- England batsman Jonathan Trott has been named the ICC's cricketer of the year for 2011.

The 30-year-old headed off teammate Alastair Cook, who won the Test player award, last year's winner Sachin Tendulkar of India and South Africa opening batsman Hashim Amla.

He scored 1,042 runs in 12 Tests, including four centuries at an average of 65 per innings, as top-ranked England won series against Australia, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan. In 24 one-day internationals, he hit 1,064 runs at an average of 48.

"It's fantastic to be part of a successful team, and I never envisaged winning this award. It's a brilliant feeling to be recognized," the South Africa-born Trott said at the awards ceremony in London on Monday.

The awards, in their eighth year, covered the period from August 11, 2010 to August 3, 2011.

Cook scored 1,302 runs at an average of 51.74 in 12 Tests during that period, including 235 not out as England retained the Ashes -- winning a five-day series in Australia for the first time since 1987.

India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the Spirit of Cricket award after allowing England batsman Ian Bell to be reinstated after a controversial run out during the second Test at Nottingham in July.

Sri Lanka batsman and wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara won both the one-day player award and the People's Choice prize, voted for by the public.

New Zealand bowler Tim Southee claimed the award for best Twenty20 international performance after taking five wickets and holding a catch during a victory at home to Pakistan in December.

West Indies leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo was named as Emerging Player of the Year, while 20-year-old compatriot Stafanie Taylor won the top women's award for her performances with both bat and ball.

Pakistan's Aleem Dar won the top umpire award for the third year in a row, heading off five-time recipient Simon Taufel, his fellow Australian Steve Davis and England's Ian Gould.
