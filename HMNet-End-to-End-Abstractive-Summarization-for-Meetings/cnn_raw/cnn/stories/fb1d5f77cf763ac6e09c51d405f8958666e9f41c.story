(CNN) -- Two stunt pilots survived a plane crash caused by engine trouble at an air show in Texas on Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration said.

Stunned onlookers at the Air Fiesta show watched as the plane plummeted, leaving a white trail behind as it dove toward a wooded area near an airport in Brownsville, Texas.

The stunt team onboard -- married couple Kyle and Amanda Franklin -- "suffered severe burns following the crash," according to a statement on the air show's website.

They were in the middle of a wing-walking act when the engine problems began, FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said.

"The female wing-walker was able to get back into the airplane, but the plane crashed into a thicket near the runway," Lunsford said.

On their website, the couple describes their act: "Together Kyle and Amanda have created a swaggering, wing-walking pirate show that would make Captain Jack Sparrow gulp. This flying circus of "Pirated Skies" will have audiences yelling 'Aaargh' as Amanda wing walks, playing the part of 'Scandalous Scarlett' and sword fights with Kyle, the menacing 'Captain Kyro.'"

The statement on the air show's website, which includes a painting of the couple sword-fighting in a plane with a skull and crossbones, said the two-day event would continue Sunday "and will be dedicated to Kyle and Amanda."

According to their website, both pilots' fathers were also stunt pilots who died when their planes collided in a mid-air collision at an air show in 2005.

"Their love rose from the ashes of the plane wreckage and their abilities as an air show act are a testament to the ongoing legacy of a family fated to continue dancing on wings of airplanes," the site says.
