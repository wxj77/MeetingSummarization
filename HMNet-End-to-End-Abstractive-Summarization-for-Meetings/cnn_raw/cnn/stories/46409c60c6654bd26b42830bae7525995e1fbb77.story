(CNN)Just in time to thwart that New Year's resolution to eat healthier, the Girl Scouts announced today they will offer three new cookie varieties for 2015.

Two of the new offerings are gluten-free: Toffee-tastic, a cookie with toffee bits; and Trios, a cookie made with peanut butter, chocolate chips and whole grain oats.

Rah-Rah Raisins, an oatmeal raisin cookie with Greek yogurt-flavored chunks, will also be available for the first time.

Approximately 1.5 million Girl Scouts sell 200 million boxes of cookies each year during the selling season, which begins in January, according to Anna Maria Chavez, the CEO of Girl Scouts of the USA. This year marks the organization's 98th year of cookie sales.

In addition to the new cookie varieties, 2015 will be the first year troop members can set up a website to sell those Thin Mints, Tagalongs and more online.
