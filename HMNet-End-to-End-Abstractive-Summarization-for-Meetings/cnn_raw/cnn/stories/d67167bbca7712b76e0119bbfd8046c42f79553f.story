New York (CNN) -- Legendary talk show host Larry King, who set a world record for the longest-running television show hosted by the same person, will be honored this fall with a lifetime achievement Emmy.

The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced Thursday that King is being honored for his "influential 50-year broadcasting career" and his 25 years hosting CNN's "Larry King Live."

"Larry King Live" debuted on CNN in June 1985. King drew viewers with a unique conversational approach to interviewing. Time magazine called him "master of the mic."

Over the course of his career, he conducted 50,000 interviews, including every president since Richard Nixon, Hollywood's top celebrities and the day's top newsmakers.

"Larry King changed the landscape of cable television, and television news in general," the academy said.

"King's show was a must-stop for presidents and politicians, and gave viewers direct access to some of the most important and influential people in the United States and the world. From the White House to Graceland, from the beaches of Normandy to New York's Ground Zero, from inside the boxing ring with Mike Tyson to the basketball court with LeBron James, King took his viewers on a remarkable, first-hand journey with him," the academy said.

"Larry King Live" went off the air in December of 2010, but King continues to host specials for CNN.

King, who started as a local radio announcer in Miami and later was the host of a nationwide radio interview show, will receive the lifetime achievement award for news and documentary September 26 in New York.
