(CNN) -- One lucky ticket picked up the United Kingdom's biggest ever lottery prize of just over Â£113 million ($180 million) on Friday night.

Alison Baldwin, a spokeswoman for the Camelot Group, which operates the UK National Lottery, said the Euromillions ticket could belong to an individual or a syndicate, but the winner or winners have not yet come forward to claim the prize.

Emma Lucas, a senior media relations manager for Camelot, told CNN that the odds of winning the money were just over 76 million to one.

If the winning ticket belongs to an individual, he or she will instantly overtake the likes of rocker David Bowie, singer Robin Gibb from the Bee Gees and pop star Robbie Williams on the UK rich list.

The prize is not, however, the largest Euromillions win. That honor belongs to a Spanish ticketholder who hit the nine-country-wide lottery in May.
