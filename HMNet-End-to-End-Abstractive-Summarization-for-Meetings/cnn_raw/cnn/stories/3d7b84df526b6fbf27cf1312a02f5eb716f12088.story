(CNN) -- The family of the FedEx worker who police say went on a shooting rampage at his suburban Atlanta workplace before committing suicide has offered its "deepest sympathies and condolences" to the victims.

Police said Geddy L. Kramer, 19, wounded six people at a FedEx package and delivery facility in Kennesaw, Georgia, on Tuesday morning before turning the gun on himself.

"First and foremost, our family would like to express our deepest sympathies and condolences to the victims of ... (the) tragedy and their families," Geddy's family wrote in a statement released Tuesday by police in nearby Acworth, where Kramer lived. "Our prayers are for their complete and speedy recovery.

"Our thoughts are also with all the workers at FedEx who were affected by Geddy's actions. We make no excuses for his actions and are shocked and devastated by them. There really are no adequate words at a time like this. Our family would appreciate our privacy at this very difficult time."

Police said they were alerted to the shooting at the 500,000-square-foot facility at 5:54 a.m. Tuesday. The six wounded workers were taken to a hospital, where one of them, a 28-year-old man, was in critical condition Tuesday evening, the hospital said.

Three other patients -- a 52-year-old woman, a 22-year-old man and a 38-year-old man -- were listed in stable condition Tuesday evening. Two others, a 42-year-old woman and a 19-year-old man, were treated and released, the hospital said.
