(CNN) -- Perhaps Sandra Bullock was just overwhelmed.

The "Gravity" star had a busy Thursday thanks to her Oscar nod, and by the time she took the stage at that night's Critics' Choice Movie Awards, she let an F-bomb slip during her acceptance speech for best actress in an action movie.

Bullock was trying to get out her "thank you's" when a technical glitch interrupted. "What the f***?" a surprised Bullock said before joking that she's an action star.

The 49-year-old wasn't the only to go off-script that night: Bradley Cooper sneaked in the expletive during the best comedy acceptance speech, calling his co-stars "these f***ing actors."

So the two played it a little loose, but on the other hand, they were probably still riding a high from that morning's celebration. Cooper, too, is nominated for an Oscar this year in the best supporting actor category.

In fact, some of the Critics' Choice picks mirrored Academy nominations for Oscars earlier that day: Matthew McConaughey, Cate Blanchett, Alfonso Cuaron and "12 Years A Slave's" Lupita Nyong'o were all winners.

Could this be a reflection of what we'll see on Oscars night? "12 Years" director Steve McQueen is probably hoping so. Although it was Cuaron's "Gravity" that won the most awards -- a total of seven, including best director, best score, best sci-fi/horror film and best visual effects -- it was "12 Years" that took home the big prize of the night, best picture.

The film's screenwriter, John Ridley, also won the Critics' Choice award for best adapted screenplay.
