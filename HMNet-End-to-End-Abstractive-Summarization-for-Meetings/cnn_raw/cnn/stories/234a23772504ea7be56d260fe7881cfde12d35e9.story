In horse racing, there's the trifecta. In entertainment, there's the EGOT for winners of the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards. Maybe in the future there will be something called the Seacrest -- for holding down hosting gigs with all four major American broadcasters.

The superfecta was trumpeted on Tuesday when CBS confirmed that Ryan Seacrest will host and produce "Fashion Rocks," a two-hour special that airs on the network in September.

Seacrest has existing relationships with ABC, to host "New Year's Rockin' Eve," with Fox, to host "American Idol," and with NBC. In other words, CBS was the only broadcaster left. (Unless you count the Spanish-language Univision network; Seacrest, are you boning up on your Spanish?)

Seacrest's new deal with CBS, and an extension of his existing deal with NBC, were first reported by The Hollywood Reporter.

NBC subsequently confirmed that Seacrest has re-upped for one year.

"This new deal will include hosting and producing 2015 Live from the Red Carpet events for E!, contributing to E! News, as well as hosting and producing specials for E! and NBC," a network spokeswoman said.

There had been speculation that Seacrest would stop hosting the red carpet shows.

What's missing from the extended deal instead are NBC News and NBC Sports. When the deal was originally struck in 2012, Seacrest was named a "special correspondent" on the "Today" show, which is a part of the news division, and a contributor to NBC's prime time coverage of the Olympics, which is a part of the sports division.

Seacrest told The Hollywood Reporter that "he'd like to try to continue working with both divisions and has already had conversations with NBC Sports about collaborating on the Olympics coverage in Rio in 2016, as he did the London games in 2012. 'Today' is less likely, given a morning radio schedule that has him in Los Angeles while the NBC show broadcasts out of New York."
