(CNN) -- Manager Arsene Wenger and midfielder Samir Nasri will both miss Arsenal's next Champions League match after opting not to appeal against one-match suspensions.

The pair were handed the bans by UEFA, while Wenger was also fined $14,00, for "inappropriate language" towards referee Massimo Busacca following the 3-1 defeat to Barcelona earlier this month.

Wenger was enraged by the Swiss official's decision to send off striker Robin van Persie for a second yellow card for kicking the ball away early in the second half.

Van Persie was cautioned for taking a shot at goal, just one second after being blown for offside, with the Dutchman protesting that he had not heard the referee's whistle due to the noise of the 95,000 crowd at the Camp Nou stadium.

Arsenal eventually lost the tie 4-3 on aggregate and Wenger insisted that he would deny the charge levelled against him.

However, the English Premier League club have now decided not to take the matter any further.

A statement on the club's official website read: "Arsenal have decided not to appeal against UEFA bans for Arsene Wenger and Samir Nasri.

"The manager and the midfielder were each suspended for one European match following charges of improper conduct in the wake of Arsenal's Champions League exit at Barcelona."
