(Mashable) -- HTC has launched a new flagship Android smartphone, the HTC One X, at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

The majority of mobile giants had their announcements before the actual start of the MWC -- including Samsung, LG and Sony.

HTC had the last, and perhaps the most glamorous event of the day, held in a huge rounded dome at the top of the CÃºpula las Arenas next to Fira de Barcelona, where the main conference is held.

The HTC One X (the first in a new line of devices called simply HTC One), unveiled by the company CEO Peter Chou, is a 4.7-inch, quad core Tegra 3-powered beast in a polycarbonate white shell.

The device also brings a vastly improved camera experience, called Image Sense. The camera takes photos quickly -- in 0.7 seconds. It has 8 megapixels and uses an f/2.0 lens, which captures more light than any other HTC smartphone camera.

It also takes great photos in unfavorable light conditions, thanks to the device's HDR algorithm.

An on-screen comparison with the photos taken with an HTC One X and an iPhone 4S portrays HTC's device as a clear winner, but we're sure Apple will have a word or two to say about that.

HTC is bundling a bunch of extras with the device: 25 GB of free Dropbox-powered storage, Beats Audio sound (HTC acquired Beats Audio in August 2011) and a feature called Media Link, which takes your photos and videos from the smartphone to the TV (through a special gadget that connects to any TV) with a three-finger swipe on the smartphone's screen.

The company also launched two other HTC One devices with slightly lower specs -- the HTC One S and the HTC One V.

All three devices should be hitting the market in the next two months, likely in April.
