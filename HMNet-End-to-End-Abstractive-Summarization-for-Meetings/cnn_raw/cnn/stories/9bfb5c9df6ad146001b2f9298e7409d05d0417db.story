(CNN) -- After what may have felt like an endless wait, Pink Floyd will deliver a new album this fall.

The record, called "The Endless River," will be the British band's first new release in 20 years.

Fans were tipped off to its arrival on Saturday when Polly Samson, the wife of singer/guitarist David Gilmour, shared the news on Twitter. "Btw Pink Floyd album out in October," Samson tweeted. "Based on 1994 sessions is Rick Wright's swansong and very beautiful."

Keyboardist Rick Wright, who was one of Pink Floyd's founding members, died of cancer in 2008.

"The Endless River" will arrive on the heels of the 20th anniversary of Pink Floyd's "The Division Bell," an occasion marked with a deluxe reissue June 30. According to a statement from the band, the upcoming album has its roots in that 1994 disc.

"('Endless River') is an album of mainly ambient and instrumental music based on the 1993/4 'Division Bell' sessions," Pink Floyd said in a statement. "The album is produced by David Gilmour with Phil Manzanera, Youth and recording engineer Andy Jackson. Work is still in progress, but more details to come at the end of the summer."

Although "Endless River" has a connection to the past, singer Durga McBroom-Hudson (who's toured with the band and offers her vocals on the new album) shared on her Facebook page that it will consist of "all unreleased songs."
