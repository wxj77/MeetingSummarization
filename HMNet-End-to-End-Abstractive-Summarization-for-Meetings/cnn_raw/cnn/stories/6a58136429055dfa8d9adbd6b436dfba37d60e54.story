Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles Police want to question a "person of interest" in the theft of nearly all of legendary tennis champion Pete Sampras' trophy collection from a public storage facility.

The 14-time Grand Slam titleholder learned that 51 of his 64 championship trophies -- including those marking his first Australian Open cup, five season-ending ATP World Tour titles, two Davis Cup wins and other memorabilia -- were among the coveted items stolen. The theft occurred about one month ago, police said.

"It was a very highly secure storage center," said Lt. Robert Edgar, who supervises a Special Burglary Section at Los Angeles Police headquarters.  He declined to give further details about the investigation or the potential market value of the stolen items.

Sampras, his wife, actress Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, and their two sons recently moved from their Thousand Oaks, California, estate to Brentwood. Their Thousand Oaks property on the grounds of the Sherwood Country Club is listed for $25 million.

Sampras held the No. 1 ranking on the Association of Tennis Professionals from 1993 to 1998.  Those six trophies are also missing.

He defeated Andre Agassi at the 2002 U.S. Open before retiring the following year with the most grand slam wins in tennis history. Roger Federer later surpassed his record with 16 major titles.
