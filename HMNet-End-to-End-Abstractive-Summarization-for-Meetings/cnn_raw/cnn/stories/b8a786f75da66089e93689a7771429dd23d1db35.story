Why style matters

If we live in a particular way, we want the same when we travel; and the airline and hotel industry are more in tune with what we want than ever before. We look at why style matters on the road and in the air.

Attire to suit every occasion

We get some golden rules from Hollywood stylist Negar Ali who shows Richard Quest how to co-ordinate and downsize his wardrobe, and a secret weapon - equivalent to the 'little black dress'.

Bags of style

Your suitcase travels as much as you do and is often the next thing people look at after your clothes. For some, making a statement with their luggage is important, for others functionality is the key. Two business travelers road test some stylish pieces whilst on their business trip to Maastricht.

Smart Traveller

This month's Smart Traveller focuses on tagging services that reunites lost property with the owner. Richard Quest found out that it really does work when he left his Treo PDA in the back of a New York taxi and only realized he'd lost it when he got an email from Zreturn once in LA.
