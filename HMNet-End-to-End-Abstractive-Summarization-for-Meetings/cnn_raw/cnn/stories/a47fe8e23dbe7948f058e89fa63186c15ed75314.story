Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A Los Angeles photographer claims singer and former Playboy model Tila Tequila kidnapped his girlfriend and threatened to kill him a week ago, according to a court filing made public Wednesday.

Garry Sun filed an application for a temporary restraining order against Tequila, who stands less than 5 feet and weighs just 90 pounds.

"The story is patently absurd," said Alan Gutman, Tequila's lawyer. "The allegations are delusional and a work of fiction."

Sun, who said he is Tequila's former boyfriend, accused her of making "several threats to my girlfriend (21-year-old Shyla Jennings) that if police were in any ways notified of her crimes, that either she or I would be killed."

His application for the restraining order, which was obtained by CNN, alleged that on October 19, Jennings "was kidnapped from her home in Houston, Texas, and was flown to Los Angeles." It does not detail how Tequila was involved in the alleged kidnapping.

Tequila "drove to my home address with four armed men with guns threatening to kill me and threatening my father," Sun said.

Tequila's lawyer said Sun "is a former paparazzi who was terminated from his role on Tila's website and is now desperate to get back at her."

She has two witnesses who "can confirm that she had nothing to do with any of these ridiculous claims," Gutman said.

"Mr. Sun's filing shows that anyone can file anything in a courthouse," Gutman said. "He will undoubtedly be held accountable by appropriate authorities for making these false allegations."

Sun has not returned CNN calls for comment.

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Anthony Jones has not yet decided whether he will grant the temporary restraining order.
