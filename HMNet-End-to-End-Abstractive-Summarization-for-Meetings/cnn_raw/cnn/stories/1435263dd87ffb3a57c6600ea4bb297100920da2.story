(EW.com) -- Get ready for more bad hair, mustaches, funky leisure suits, and laughs.

Paramount Pictures has set the theater release date for the sequel to 2004â€²s "Anchorman" for Dec. 20, 2013.

Will Ferrell will be back as deep-voiced newsman Ron Burgundy, along with Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, and David Koechner in the comedy directed by script co-writer Adam McKay. McKay has hinted that the sequel will have whole song sequences, and we can only imagine Ferrell's thick Burgundy mustache fluttering in the breeze during a diva number backed by the Channel 4 News gang.
