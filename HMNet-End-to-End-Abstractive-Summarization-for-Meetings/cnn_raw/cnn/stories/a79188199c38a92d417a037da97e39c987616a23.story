(EW.com) -- Shortly before the release of 2010â€²s Will Forte-starring action-comedy "MacGruber," the "Saturday Night Live" star told this writer that he would definitely like to make a sequel.

"That is a dream scenario," said the comic. "Just to be working with the same group of people would be awesome. I would love the chance to do that again... in a tropical setting."

The chances of anyone ever putting up the dough for "MacGruber 2" seemed subatomically slight after the film garnered some dismal reviews -- EW's Liza Schwarzbaum dismissed it as "90 minutes of talented performers doing and saying dumb, crude stuff in pursuit of an elusive laugh" -- and a mere $4.1 million on its opening weekend.

The good-natured Forte essentially admitted that he and director Jorma Taccone had laid a box-office egg last year when my colleague Grady Smith puckishly asked him, in the course of an "Awkward Questions" Q&A, what he had planned for "MacGruber 3." The comedian's reply? "We're definitely gonna make Kristen Wiig's part a little bigger and we're gonna call it 'Bridesmaids 2: MacGruber 3.' And the 'MacGruber 3' will be in very small print."

So it comes as a surprise to learn that Forte and Taccone have been discussing a "MacGruber" sequel. Earlier this week the website Screen Crush quoted Taccone as saying that "Every time I hang out with Will, we talk about all our cool ideas for the sequel. We have the idea for it and we have a title, but I won't tell you what it is."

Truth be told, the idea of a "MacGruber" sequel is not quite as bizarre as it might at first appear. If the original film didn't make money, it certainly didn't lose that much thanks to its small $10 million budget. And Forte, Taccone, and co-writer John Solomon's unhingedly risquÃ© creation does have its fans.

Devin Fraci of the Alamo Drafthouse blog Bada-- Digest actually made "MacGruber" one of his top 10 movies of 2010, hailing Taccone's directorial debut as "exactly the right combination of raunchy, stupid, anarchic and plain weird." And just yesterday, chud.com's Tim Kelly wrote that "No comedy of the last few years is more deserving of a cult following than MacGruber."

True, the film has yet to accrue the kind of cult fanbase which has developed around Tommy Wiseau's so-bad-it's-amazing "The Room" -- a movie referenced in "MacGruber" -- but that may be because it's not that bad (for the record, this reporter supports any project in which Val Kilmer plays a character called "Dieter Von Cunth").

The bad news for "MacGruber" fans is that Taccone looks likely to next make an adaptation of comic "The Great Unknown" (and the bad news for Forte's hopes of filming somewhere tropical is that, according to Taccone, a sequel would follow in the footsteps of "Die Hard" by being Christmas-themed).

So here's the question: Would you pay money to see "MacGruber 2"?
