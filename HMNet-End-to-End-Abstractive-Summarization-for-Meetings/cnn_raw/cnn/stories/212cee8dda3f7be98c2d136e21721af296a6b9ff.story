Los Angeles (CNN) -- A third person was charged with murder Tuesday in the California death of a deployed Marine's wife, the San Diego County prosecutor's office said.

Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino, 36, pleaded not guilty in court Tuesday, said Steve Walker, a spokesman for the district attorney's office.

Brittany Killgore, 22, the wife of Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore, was last seen alive April 13, and authorities found her body on April 17 in a rural part of Riverside County.

A San Diego County judge set Maraglino's bail at $3 million on Tuesday and scheduled a May 22 hearing on readiness and a preliminary hearing for May 30, Walker said.

If convicted, Maraglino faces 25 years to life in prison, Walker said.

Also charged with murder in Killgore's death is Marine Staff Sgt. Luis Ray Perez, 45, with whom Killgore was last seen alive, when she left her apartment wearing an evening dress on a date with Perez, who is based at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County, police said.

The remaining defendant is Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, also charged with murder. She was found at a Ramada motel near the San Diego airport last month after paramedics responded to a call for medical help. Lopez was briefly hospitalized with lacerations, and her relationship to Killgore hasn't been made clear by authorities.

Perez and Lopez have also pleaded not guilty.

Brittany Killgore had recently filed for divorce from her husband, who was serving with an artillery unit in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, investigators said. Cory Killgore was granted an emergency leave to return to the United States when he learned about his wife last month.

"My wife, Brittany, was beautiful beyond words and her murder has left me devastated. My duty to her memory is now to ensure her good reputation remains intact, and help law enforcement and prosecutors secure justice for the person or persons who took her away from me," Cory Killgore said in April.
