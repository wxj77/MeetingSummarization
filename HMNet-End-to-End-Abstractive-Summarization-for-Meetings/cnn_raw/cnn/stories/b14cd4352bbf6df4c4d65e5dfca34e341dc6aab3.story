New Delhi (CNN) -- Part of a residential building collapsed in central Mumbai on Monday evening, killing four people and injuring six, and rescuers continued to search for others who might be trapped Tuesday morning, officials said.

Municipal commissioner Sitaram Kunte told CNN Tuesday that four people have died and six have been rescued with injuries. He said one wing of a two- or three-story apartment building collapsed in the Mahim district of central Mumbai.

"We are estimating that three to four people are still trapped inside the building," he said.

Fire brigades rushed to the scene, and video showed dozens of rescuers working to clear rubble.

Indian media reported that the collapse happened after heavy monsoon rains.

Just last week, a vacant building was being torn down in downtown Philadelphia when a four-story wall collapsed onto an adjacent Salvation Army thrift store. The incident left six people dead and 13 others injured.

In April, the nine-story Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh collapsed, killing 1,130 people and injuring more than 2,400.
