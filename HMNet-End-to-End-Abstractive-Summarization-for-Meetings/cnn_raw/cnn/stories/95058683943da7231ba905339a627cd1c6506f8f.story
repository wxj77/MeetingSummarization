(CNN Student News) -- August 29, 2013

In Thursday's program, we consider global reaction to the suspected use of chemical weapons in Syria, and we share some student views on possible U.S. military action against the Middle Eastern country. We also dive into what scientists are calling the confirmation of a previously identified element. Plus, we report on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, and we hear from a photographer who documented the 1963 March on Washington.
