(CNN) -- One person has died and another was trapped in a pair of avalanches in the Utah mountains Sunday afternoon, authorities said.

One of the Utah avalanches, at Snowbird Ski Resort, buried one woman under 2 feet of snow. She later died.

Heather Gross, 27, died Sunday evening at a hospital in Salt Lake City from her injuries, Salt Lake County Sheriff's Deputy Levi Hughes said.

Gross, a county resident, had been buried under 2 feet of snow by an early-afternoon snowslide at Snowbird Ski Resort, Hughes said.

Rescue teams found her about an hour after the avalanche, and she was flown to University of Utah hospital, where she died.

A man who was with her at the time was not injured and reported the slide, Hughes said.

A second avalanche occurred nearby in the backcountry area known as Lake Desolation, said Randy Doyle, a spokesman for the Big Cottonwood Canyon resorts nearby.

He said the avalanche, which left at least one person trapped, was not within the resort.
