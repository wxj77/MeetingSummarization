(CNN Student News) -- November 6, 2014

If you teach social studies, civics, government or political science, you won't want to miss this Thursday's show. We're examining a dramatically changing landscape in the U.S. Congress. We're exploring why the midterm results matter and how they could impact the president's agenda. And after explaining a theory concerning pirates, we're visiting a wildlife sanctuary to see what it's like to care for big cats.
