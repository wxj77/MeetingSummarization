Washington (CNN) -- Warren Buffett is so sure that Hillary Clinton will win the presidency in 2016, he is willing to wager some of his $58.2 billion net worth.

"Hillary is going to win, yeah," Buffett, a outspoken Clinton supporter, said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit. "I will bet money on it. And I don't do that easily."

But while Clinton has said she is thinking about running for president, she has yet to announce.

Buffett suggested on Tuesday that her announcement is a forgone conclusion.

"Hillary is going to run," said the chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway, later adding that "she is going to announce as late as possible."

"I don't see how you could have anybody better qualified," Buffett told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview. "I like what she believes in. ... I think she's extraordinarily able and energetic for that matter in pushing those beliefs."

Buffett has long supported Clinton -- he donated $2,000 to her Senate campaign in 2000. But the investor from Omaha, Nebraska, supported Clinton and then-Sen. Barack Obama in their fight for the Democratic nomination in 2008.

Buffett was less sure about which Republicans would run for president, he said at the fortune event.

"I don't know," he said. "Her opponent will be whoever wins the Republican primary and there are going to be a lot of people who want to do it."
