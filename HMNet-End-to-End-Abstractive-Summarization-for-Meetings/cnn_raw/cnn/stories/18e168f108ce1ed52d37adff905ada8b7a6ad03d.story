(CNN)  -- Real Madrid had goalkeeper Iker Casillas sent off in the second minute but battled to a 1-0 win at Espanyol Sunday to cut Barcelona's lead at the top of Spain's La Liga to five points.

Spain World Cup keeper Casillas went for clipping home midfielder Jose Callejon as he raced clear from a through ball, his sending off the quickest ever for a Real player in a Spanish league match.

Manager Jose Mourinho had to introduce youngster Antonio Adan from the bench and sacrificed Argentina star Angel Di Maria, but it sparked an impressive display from Los Blancos.

With a numerical advantage Espanyol did occasionally threaten and from the resulting free kick Luis Garcia saw his effort saved by Adan, but it was Real who were the more threatening.

Marcelo clipped the crossbar with a rising shot before he was found by Cristiano Ronaldo and scored from an acute angle in the 23rd minute.

Marcelo then sent Emmanuel Adebayor clear, but the Togo striker slipped as he shot and his effort looped onto the top of the crossbar.

Espanyol applied more pressure in the second half and Callejon might have equalized only to send his effort wide of the far post.

But in the dying moments Carlos Kameni twice denied Adebayor from point-blank range with superb saves, both times after receiving passes from the hard- working Ronaldo.

Barcelona's winning run was halted Saturday as they were held 1-1 by Sporting Gijon, giving arch-rivals Real the chance to close the gap.

In other La Liga action Sunday, Villarreal slipped two points behind rivals Valencia in the battle for Champions League places with their second successive league defeat, beaten 1-0 at Deportivo La Coruna.

Defender Alberto Lopo's goal on the hour mark sealed three vital points for Depor, who move out of the relegation zone while their visitors stay fourth.

Meanwhile, promoted pair Hercules and Levante improved their chances of staying in the top flight with wins over Real Zaragoza and Almeria respectively.
