(EW.com) -- HBO is renewing "Real Time with Bill Maher" for two more years.

The late-night left-wing talk show is getting an 11th and 12th season on the premium cable network, taking the program through 2014.

"Bill Maher's irreverent wit and fearless insights make him the perfect observer for these unpredictable times," HBO programming president Michael Lombardo said. "I'm delighted that we can continue to offer an uncensored forum for his original and thoughtful humor."

Maher has been a fixture on HBO since his first stand-up special for the network in 1989 and currently has an overall deal with the network. His latest book has a title that pretty much sums up his perspective: "The New New Rules: A Funny Look at How Everybody but Me Has Their Head Up Their A**."

HBO is owned by the parent company of CNN.
