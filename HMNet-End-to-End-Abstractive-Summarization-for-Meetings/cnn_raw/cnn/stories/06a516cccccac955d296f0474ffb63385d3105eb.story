(CNN) -- Perhaps Bruno Mars really did win the Super Bowl.

According to Billboard, the Grammy-winning singer is set to return to the charts after his halftime performance on Sunday. It reports that sales of his latest album, "Unorthodox Jukebox," rose by 164% after Mars took to the Super Bowl stage with the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. The album was released in December 2012.

Such an increase in sales is not rare or unexpected. Last year's halftime performer, Beyonce, reportedly saw a bump in sales of her "4" album by 123%.

And Mars is not an unknown quantity, though some of Sunday's viewers may have just discovered him. In 2010, he won a Grammy for best male pop vocal performance for his song "Just the Way You Are." In January, "Unorthodox Jukebox" won Mars his second Grammy, this time for best pop vocal album.

The album may re-enter the top 10 when sales figures are released by Soundscan on Wednesday. This year's Super Bowl drew a record-breaking 111.5 million viewers.

As is customary, Mars did not receive an appearance fee for his Super Bowl performance. Artists do it for the exposure, and that has clearly paid off for Mars.

Zack O'Malley Greenburg from Forbes writes that the singer may see the most return in increased ticket prices and sales for his Moonshine Jungle tour.

"In 2013, the singer grossed $72.4 million on 84 shows; his average ticket price sits at about $66," O'Malley Greenburg writes. "With the added exposure from the Super Bowl, he could easily push prices closer to the $120 average of his halftime show predecessor, Beyonce."
