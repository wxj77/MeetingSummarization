(Mashable)  -- The enormously popular "Angry Birds" game for iOS and Android just got 30 new levels with a chance to find one more, and the update is free.

The title of the new western-themed episode is "Ham 'Em High," and it includes subtle additions and improvements. (To clarify -- the Android version is new, the iOS version has been available for a few weeks but received 15 new levels.)

There are cowboy hats and sombreros that have their own unique physics.

And, the game's developer Rovio seems to pay homage to its handheld game competitor "Cut the Rope" -- a new element in "Angry Birds" has rocks and sawblades hanging by ropes you can cut with the catapulted birds, turning the rocks and blades into rolling projectiles that can wreak havoc on those nasty porkers.

Rovio has hidden a secret level that you can find if you found a clue in yesterday's Super Bowl game, where an unlock code will pop up during a commercial for the movie "Rio." Rovio recently announced a "Rio"/"Angry Birds" tie-in.

Android users will be happy to know that according to TheTechJournal, there's a bug fix included, adding QVGA support, optimizations that make the game more stable, and support for more Android devices.
