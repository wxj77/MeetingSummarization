(CNN) -- Ten years ago we were carrying flip-screen mobiles, Evanescence was top of the charts and just 11.4% of the world was online.

Internet giants like Google and Yahoo were already changing the way we explored the world, but sites like Facebook and Twitter were yet to upend how we communicated online.

It's a theme being explored by Le Web, Europe's largest tech conference which is taking place in Paris this week.

Augmented reality will become the norm, and predictive software will deliver the answer to scientific, medical or personal queries for which we seek answers.

The Internet of Things -- in which machines are interconnected, intuitive and predictive -- will become the reality of our everyday lives.

As TheFuturesAgency's chief executive Gerd Leonard puts it, we may start feeling like a machine lives inside us -- or we live inside a machine.

But alongside the exponential growth in technology, more community-minded trends have emerged.

Online letting market AirBnB, car-sharing service Lyft and online education outlet Coursera are tapping into a desire to share intelligence, space and journeys in the real world.
