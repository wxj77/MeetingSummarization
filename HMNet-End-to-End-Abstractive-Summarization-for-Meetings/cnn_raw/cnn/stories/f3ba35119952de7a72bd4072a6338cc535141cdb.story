NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A government school in southern India has tested pupils' karate skills by running over their outstretched arms with a motorcycle.

K. Devarajan, the director of elementary education in Tamil Nadu state, told CNN that the event, held recently, was organized with the consent of parents.

State education authorities have now asked schools not to carry out such activities because they violate safety guidelines, which he claimed were already in place in state educational institutions.

Devarajan said officers visited the school after learning about the controversial show.

Newspaper pictures Tuesday showed a motorcyclist driving over the limbs of a row of schoolchildren lying with their faces down in the state's Villupuram district.

It also showed smiling adults standing behind the young children.

The act aimed to show the strength the students had gained from their karate classes, Devarajan said.

Nobody was injured, said P. Perumalsamy, a senior state education official.

The students involved were aged between six and 13, he added.
