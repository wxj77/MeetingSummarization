(CNN) -- American Steve Stricker clinched a one-shot victory on the final day of the John Deere Classic to win the event in Illinois for the third year in a row.

The 44-year-old finished with two birdies to card a 69 and move onto 22-under-par, narrowly defeating rookie Kyle Stanley.

Canadian Matt McQuillan and world number 33 Zach Johnson were four strokes behind the 23-year-old Stanley, tied for third position on 17-under-par.

Stricker, who has claimed 19 tournament wins since turning pro in 1990, is only the 10th post-war golfer to have triumphed at the same event three years running.

"It was an unbelievable week and an unbelievable finish," the new world number five told the PGA Tour's official web site. "I still can't believe I'm sitting here.

Stricker holed a 25-foot putt on the 18th to complete his triumph, having recovered from losing a five-stroke lead during his final round to emerge victorious.

"When I get into a situation where I have to make a putt, I feel like my nerves kind of go away and I focus extremely hard on trying to make that putt. And that's kind of like the little zone I got into on 17 and 18, I guess."

Americans Charles Howell III and Chez Reavie shared fifth place on the final leaderboard, both carding 16-under for their 72 holes.

Australia's Cameron Percy and Brendon de Jonge of Zimbabwe were tied for seventh on 15-under, with Briny Baird and Brian Gay one shot back in ninth.

Meanwhile, So Yeon Ryu defeated her fellow South Korean Hee Kyung Seo in a three-hole playoff to clinch the women's U.S. Open.

The 21-year-old secured her first major championship win after finishing the additional holes on two-under-par, three shots better than 25-year-old Seo.
