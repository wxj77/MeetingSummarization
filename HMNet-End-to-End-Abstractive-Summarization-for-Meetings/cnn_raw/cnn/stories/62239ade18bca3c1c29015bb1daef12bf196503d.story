NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Academy Award-winning actress Tatum O'Neal was released after an arraignment at a Manhattan courtroom Monday after her weekend arrest for buying crack cocaine.

No bail was set, and none was requested by the prosecutor.

The 44-year-old actress, who penned a 2004 memoir about her long road to sobriety, was arrested around 7:30 p.m. Sunday on the Lower East Side of Manhattan after she was seen making a purchase from a drug dealer, police said.

Investigators charged her with criminal possession of a controlled substance, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum one-year sentence.

The Monday afternoon arraignment took about 15 minutes, during which the actress was read her charge. O'Neal did not enter a plea, which is not necessary at an arraignment.

Her next court date is scheduled for July 28.

At 10, O'Neal won an Oscar for best supporting actress in the movie "Paper Moon." She is the daughter of actor Ryan O'Neal, who starred in the 1973 film, and the ex-wife of tennis star John McEnroe, with whom she has three children.
