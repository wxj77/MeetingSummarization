(CNN) -- The list of people missing in tornado-ravaged Joplin, Missouri, shrunk to eight on Wednesday, as officials told CNN that the bodies of two people previously on the list had been identified.

Stanley Kirk and Maria Alvares Torres died in the storm, and their next-of-kin were notified, said Seth Bundy with the Department of Public Safety.

News reports suggested that two other people listed as "unaccounted for" may have been declared dead as well.  Bundy said declarations are not made official until family members are informed.

Authorities also announced that a woman who was not listed as missing has died as a result of the severe weather that struck May 22, Bundy said.

Over the weekend, Joplin City Manager Mark Rohr told CNN the death toll stood at 142.  Not all the names had been released.  It was not immediately clear whether the deaths announced Wednesday were included in the toll.

The May 22 tornado flattened buildings, destroyed neighborhoods and killed more people than any other U.S. tornado since modern record-keeping began in 1950.

"It's indescribable ... just devastating to see all the destruction of my school, my home," said Joplin High School sophomore Chanci McGowen, CNN affiliate KODE reported. "My whole neighborhood is gone, but everyone's OK."

The station broadcast images of a memorial service at the school, where a sign out front just had the letters "op" from "Joplin."  Someone used what looked to be duct tape to add letters, creating the word "Hope."
