Sometimes your own words aren't enough.

As the news that tech revolutionary Steve Jobs had died spread across the Internet Wednesday night, many people abstained from posting their own tributes to the Apple co-founder.

Instead, they shared Jobs' own words:

"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose," media mogul Arianna Huffington wrote on her Twitter feed, quoting Jobs' 2005 commencement address at Stanford University.

Among Jobs' other memorable quotes circulating social media sites and blogs on Wednesday night were these:

-- "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life."

-- "Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become."

-- "Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new."

-- "We're here to put a dent in the universe."
