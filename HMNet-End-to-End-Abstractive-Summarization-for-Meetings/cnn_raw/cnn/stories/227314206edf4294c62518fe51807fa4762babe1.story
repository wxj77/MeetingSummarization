Washington (CNN) -- Colgan Air, a regional airline, faces a nearly $1.9 million fine after it allegedly allowed 84 flight attendants to fly for a week after the airline was informed they had been trained on fire extinguishers that were different from those used on their aircraft.

The alleged infraction occurred in November of 2009, at a time the airline was under additional scrutiny because of a fatal crash of a Colgan Air jet near Buffalo, New York, nine months earlier. But it was unclear whether it was the additional scrutiny, or a routine inspection, that led to the discovery about the improper training.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, government inspectors discovered that new Colgan crew members were trained using a type of halon fire extinguisher found on Saab 340 aircraft, instead of the type installed on the Q400 planes they were staffing. On November 2, 2009, the FAA notified Colgan that crew members were not trained as required, but Colgan used the 84 untrained crew members on 172 flights during the next seven days, the FAA said.

The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday said it is proposing to fine Colgan $1,892,000. Colgan said it intends to appeal the fine.

"We hope the facts presented in our response result in the proposed fine being reduced or removed," said Eric Epperson of Pinnacle Airlines Corp., Colgan's parent company. "Colgan Air was using the same type extinguisher for both the Saab 340B and Q400 training, although the Q400 extinguisher has a hose," Epperson said.

"Upon notification and out of an abundance of caution, Colgan updated our training manuals and retrained all flight attendants to ensure full flight attendant understanding," he said. "Safety is a top priority at Colgan."

Colgan Air operates primarily in the northeastern United States. It operates as Continental Connection and United Express.
