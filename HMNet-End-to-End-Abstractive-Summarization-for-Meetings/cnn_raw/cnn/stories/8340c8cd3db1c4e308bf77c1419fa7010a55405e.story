Washington (CNN) -- While Florida Gov. Rick Scott and former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist took aim at each other during a bitter debate on Thursday night, viewers participated alongside the candidates, reacting in real-time using Microsoft Bing Pulse technology.

The pattern was clear from the beginning. Democrats and independents tended to stick relatively close together in their sentiment, strongly agreeing when Crist spoke and strongly disagreeing when Scott spoke. Overall, Republicans participants tended to stay more toward the middle, voting more neutrally.

Not surprisingly, Democrats and Republicans voted in extreme opposite directions throughout the debate. When Crist attacked Scott's personal fortune, Democrats and independents strongly agreed with him.

"If you're somebody like Rick Scott, and you have a private jet, and you fly 30,000 feet above people all the time, or you live in an oceanfront mansion, you're out of touch, and you're not feeling what people that are watching tonight are feeling at home," said Crist.

But when Scott blamed Crist for the loss of more than 800,000 jobs, saying he is out of touch because he grew up with wealth, Democrats strongly disagreed more than at any other point in the debate.

Strong points of agreement for Republicans occurred when Scott explained his response to Ebola and when he discussed the action he took during the Treyvon Martin case.

But when Scott attacked Crist, calling him a "divider" and a "mudslinger," he only had a slight bump from his fellow Republicans.

When it came to gender, men and women were almost in dead lockstep, voting nearly identically with very little variation throughout the night.

In total, 186,000 votes were tallied on Bing Pulse. Democrats nearly outnumbered Republicans in the real-time voting 3-to-1.
