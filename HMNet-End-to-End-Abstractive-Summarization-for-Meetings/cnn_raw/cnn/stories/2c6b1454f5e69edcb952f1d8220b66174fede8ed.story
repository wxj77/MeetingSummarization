Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least seven people were killed when a building was attacked in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Friday.

All the attackers were gunned down by security forces, the city's police chief said. A police officer and a guard were killed, police said.

According to Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, the incident went on for more than six hours before all five attackers were killed.

Sediqqi also said that eight people were injured including one Italian woman, three Nepali guards and four Afghan policemen.

He confirmed the death of one policeman, but the Kabul police chief said that one Nepali guard also was killed.

The building that came under attack is near headquarters for Afghan and international groups, including the International Organization for Migration -- a U.N.-affiliated group.

The United Nations said at least three IOM staffers and a staffer from its International Labour Organization were hurt.
