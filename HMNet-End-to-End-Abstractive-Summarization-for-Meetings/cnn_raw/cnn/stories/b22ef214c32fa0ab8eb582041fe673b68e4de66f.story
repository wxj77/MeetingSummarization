(CNN) -- Soccer stars Zinedine Zidane and Kaka will take part in a charity match to help raise funds for the the victims of the Haiti earthquake.

The two former world footballers of the year will be among 40 internationals lining up for the United Nations Development Programme's annual game, which will be held in Lisbon, Portugal on Monday.

The seventh staging of the UNDP Match Against Poverty will feature two Haitians, Jean Sony and Joseph Peterson, who play for Portuguese clubs.

Zidane, who won the World Cup with France in 1998 and retired from top-level football in 2006, is a UNDP Goodwill Ambassador along with former Brazil star Ronaldo.

Ronaldo is unavailable as he is starting a new domestic season this weekend with his club Corinthians, so compatriot and Real Madrid star Kaka will take his place in Zidane's team.

Michael Laudrup, named Denmark's best footballer of all time by his national association in 2006, will also play alongside Dutchmen Edgar Davids, Patrick Kluivert and Phillip Cocu, Portugal's Luis Figo, Czech veteran Pavel Nedved and Romania legend Gheorghe Hagi.

The opposition, the Benfica All-Star line-up, will feature Portuguese football hero Eusebio along with more recent top names such as Rui Costa and Nuno Gomes.

The U.N. said all proceeds will go toward relief and reconstruction efforts in Haiti, which was devastated by a magnitude 7.0 quake on January 12 that has killed least 72,000 people and left many more homeless.

The match is also intended to focus attention on the U.N.'s Millennium Development Goals adopted in 2000, which seek to halve world poverty by 2015.
