(Mashable.com) -- Hop into this Ego Compact Semi Submarine, and without any extensive training you can be on your way to exploring the deep blue sea in no time.

Why is this called a semi-submarine? The entire boat is not submerged, but it's more like a pontoon boat with a transparent waterproof compartment hanging from its middle.

That means James Cameron is not going to be using one of these subs for that deep-water shoot for his Avatar sequel, but it's still suitable for giving you an eye-popping view of the undersea world. Think of it as more akin to snorkeling than scuba diving.

The little boat cruises along at a leisurely sightseeing pace that's unspecified by its maker, which will only say that its batteries will last eight hours at cruising speed or four hours at top speed.

It's built by South Korean company Raonhaje, which plans to sell fleets of these Ego Semi-Submarines to resorts, and single units to individuals and yacht owners. The company offers to build custom moorings for the craft, as well as hoists for yachts.

We're thinking super-safe leisure subs like these would be a huge hit at a resort, especially seaside marinas near coral reefs, with their colorful and bustling underwater wildlife. Just think, even people who can't swim can enjoy the spectacular view.
