(CNN) -- A one-time "American Idol" finalist has died, the show's official Facebook page announced.

"Michael Johns was an incredible talent and we are deeply saddened by the news of his passing," a joint statement from Fox, FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment said.

"He was a part of our American Idol family and he will be truly missed. Our hearts and prayers go out to his family and friends during this difficult time."

According to Entertainment Weekly, the Australian-born singer, who was on the Fox program in 2008, died Friday at age 35.
