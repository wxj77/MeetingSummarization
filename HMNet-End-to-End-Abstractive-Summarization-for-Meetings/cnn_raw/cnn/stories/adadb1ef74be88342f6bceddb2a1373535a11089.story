(CNN) -- The state of Florida on Saturday filed a lawsuit against BP and Halliburton over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

The suit argues that Florida is entitled to the revenues it lost because of the spill. These include a long list of lost taxes -- sales, corporate, cigarette, liquor -- and other forms of revenue for the state, such as rental car surcharges.

Florida is also seeking punitive damages for the "misconduct that led to this environmental and economic disaster," according to a statement from the state attorney general's office.

State Attorney General Pam Bondi filed the lawsuit on the third anniversary of the oil spill.
