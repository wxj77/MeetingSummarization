(Rollingstone.com) -- In an interview with BBC 6 Music, Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson hinted that the group may reunite in the studio to celebrate their 50th anniversary.

"I'm considering it," he said.

According to Wilson, nothing is holding him back aside from a reluctance to reconnect with his old partners. "I just don't know if I want to be around those guys, you know? They're zany guys. They're crazy." Wilson has not collaborated with his former bandmates since he co-produced "Stars and Stripes Volume One," a 1996 album featuring country versions of their hit songs.

Though it remains to be seen whether or not Wilson will record new material with the band, the Beach Boys will be coming together to put the finishing touches on "Smile," the band's never-released follow-up to their 1966 masterwork "Pet Sounds."

The group will be offering input on the album's track listing, which was never firmly established as the record was never completed as originally planned.
