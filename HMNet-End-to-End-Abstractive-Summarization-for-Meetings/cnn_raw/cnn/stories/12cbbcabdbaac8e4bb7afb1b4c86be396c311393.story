(CNN)Actor Jon Hamm, who plays hard-drinking Don Draper on the hit AMC show "Mad Men," has recently completed a 30-day stint in rehab for alcohol abuse, TMZ reports.

The celebrity-news site says Hamm checked himself into the high-end Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut, at the end of February.

"With the support of his longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon Hamm recently completed treatment for his struggle with alcohol addiction," said representatives for Hamm in a statement to TMZ, People and other media outlets. "They have asked for privacy and sensitivity going forward."

The news comes less than two weeks before "Mad Men," which explores the lives of New York advertising executives in the 1960s, begins its final eight-episode run on April 5. Filming for the final episodes was completed months ago.

Missouri native Hamm, 44, toiled in near-obscurity for years in Hollywood before finding fame in 2007 as the tormented, womanizing Draper, for which he won a Golden Globe for best actor in a TV drama. He has been nominated for an acting Emmy seven times for "Mad Men" but has never won.
