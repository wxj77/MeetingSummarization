London, England (CNN) -- They are the iconic images of a thrilling 2009-10 soccer season in England that helped Bradley Ormesher claim his very own Premier League title.

The Times newspaper photographer is one of a legion of snappers who pitch up at matches the length and breadth of England and -- come rain, come shine -- chronicle the many magic moments from a grueling, nine-month campaign.

Ormesher's hard graft and spectacular imagery reaped rewards this year when, for the second time since 2008, he was crowned the Barclays Photographer of the Year, one of the most prestigious gongs in the field of football photography.

The Manchester derby proved a rich hunting ground for Ormesher, whose portfolio of five photos features three from clashes between Manchester United and City.

He captured the joy and despair on show from both sets of players after Paul Scholes's injury-time goal secured a victory for United at City to keep Alex Ferguson's title hopes alive, and Rio Ferdinand's pained reaction after Craig Bellamy had scored in the return fixture at Old Trafford.

Ormesher also snapped Blackburn goalkeeper Paul Robinson laughing in the middle of an August rainstorm, Fernando Torres holding off Rio Ferdinand prior to scoring for Liverpool and a sea of delighted faces at Everton, after Jack Rodwell had just scored the clinching goal in their win over Manchester United.

Here the man who created the images talks to Fanzone about the inspiration behind the photos and how he achieved an award-winning end product.
