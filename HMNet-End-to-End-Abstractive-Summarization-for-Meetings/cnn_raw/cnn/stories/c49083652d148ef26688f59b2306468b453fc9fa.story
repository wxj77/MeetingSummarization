Four Louisiana men have been arrested after 63 semi-automatic rifles were reported missing at a shipping warehouse, Caddo Parish Sheriff Steve Prator said Wednesday.

On October 14, two days after a gun shipment arrived, officials at Con-way Freight in Shreveport learned that one of five pallets carrying the Colt AR-15s was missing.

They were being shipped from Hartford, Connecticut, to a Shreveport-area gun distributor.

None of the missing weapons have been recovered, authorities said.

A news release from the sheriff's office said detectives and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives questioned a contractor who was a security guard at the warehouse on the day the guns arrived. After his interview, the guard was arrested and booked for theft of a firearm, as were two other men.

Authorities searched the home of a fourth man. No guns were found, but the man was arrested when police came across a 65-inch television they say was stolen from the warehouse the same day as the guns.

The sheriff's statement described the rifles as "black, 5.56 mm, semi-automatic with a law enforcement carbine and 16-inch barrel." They are valued at $800 each.

The release said it is possible some of the guns may have been sold to unwitting buyers.
