LONDON, England (CNN) -- The disabled young son of UK opposition leader David Cameron has died.

David Cameron leaves the family home after the death of his 6-year-old son on February 25.

Ivan Cameron, six, passed away early Wednesday, the UK's Press Association reported a Conservative Party spokesman as saying.  "It is with great sadness that David and Samantha Cameron must confirm the death of their six-year-old son Ivan," the spokesman said according to the agency.  The spokesman said that Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy, was taken ill overnight and died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, central London early Wednesday morning.  "David and Samantha would ask that their privacy is respected at this terribly difficult time," the spokesman added.

Meanwhile, the queen sent a private message of sympathy to the Camerons, Buckingham Palace said.

Prime minister Gordon Brown said the "thoughts and prayers of the whole country" would be with the Conservative leader and his family, The Guardian newspaper reported, while prime minister's question time -- which offers Cameron a weekly opportunity to grill Brown in parliament -- was cancelled at Brown's suggestion.

The prime minister, together with other senior British politicians, instead offered their condolences in the parliament chamber. "I know that the whole house will want to express their sorrow at the death of Ivan Cameron," Brown told lawmakers, according to The Guardian.

"He brought joy to all those around him. Every child is precious and irreplaceable. The death of a child is an unbearable sorrow no parents should have to endure."

Brown and his wife Sarah lost their first child, Jennifer Jane, in 2001 after she was born prematurely and died 10 days later. They have two sons, John and Fraser, who suffers from cystic fibrosis.
