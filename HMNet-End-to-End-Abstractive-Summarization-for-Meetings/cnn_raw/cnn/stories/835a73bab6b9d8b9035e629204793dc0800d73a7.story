(CNN) -- A blitz of attacks across Afghanistan led to the deaths of 52 armed Taliban members in the past day, the Ministry of Interior said Wednesday.

The operations were carried out by Afghanistan's national police, army, National Directorate of Security and NATO-led coalition forces, the ministry said.

An additional 45 Taliban members were wounded and 21 others arrested.

Authorities also confiscated ammunition and improvised explosive devices in the sweep, which spanned 10 provinces, the interior ministry said.

On Tuesday, the Afghan government said 23 armed members of the Taliban were killed in the previous day.

In southern Afghanistan, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said at least one of its members died Tuesday after suffering injuries in an insurgent attack this week.
