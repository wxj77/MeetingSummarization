The staggering death toll from the Syrian conflict has grown even further as at least 200 people were killed Tuesday, an opposition group said.

About 60 of them were killed in regime air strikes, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Well over 190,000 people have died in Syria in the country's three-year civil war, which is now complicated by violent takeovers of cities by the militant group ISIS.

The SOHR said an ISIS fighter took down a regime fighter jet over Raqqa, a stronghold of ISIS.
