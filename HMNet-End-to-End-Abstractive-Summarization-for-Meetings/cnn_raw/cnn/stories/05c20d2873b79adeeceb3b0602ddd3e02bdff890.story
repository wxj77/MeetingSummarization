New York (CNN) -- A Boston-bound Amtrak train derailed Monday afternoon just east of New York City's Penn Station, the rail service said.

No injuries were reported among the approximately 147 passengers and an unspecified number of crew members, Amtrak said in a news release. It called the accident, which occurred at 12:25 p.m., a "low-speed derailment."

The passengers were taken back to Penn Station in Manhattan, where arrangements were made to "provide them travel on another train," Amtrak said.

The line also is used by the Long Island Railroad. But Amtrak said the East River tunnels, which take trains from Manhattan to Long Island, "are not blocked and Amtrak and Long Island Railroad trains are operating through the area with minimal delays."
