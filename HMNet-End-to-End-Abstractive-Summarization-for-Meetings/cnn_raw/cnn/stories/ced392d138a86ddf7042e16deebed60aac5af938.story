(CNN)More than 20 years after his death from suicide, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain continues to fascinate.

On Wednesday, the trailer was released for an eagerly anticipated HBO documentary on the singer's life.

"Montage of Heck" is directed by Brett Morgen and offers an intimate portrayal of one of the architects of grunge music. The trailer features bits of interviews with those closest to the performer, including family members; his wife, musician Courtney Love; and Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic.

A companion book containing art and archival documents from Cobain is being produced to accompany the film. Morgen, who also directed the documentary "The Kid Stays in the Picture" about producer Robert Evans, said the soundtrack for the documentary will include "a mind-blowing 12-minute acoustic Cobain unheard track."
