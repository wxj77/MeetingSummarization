LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Pop star Michael Jackson has sued to stop an auction house from selling millions of dollars of the iconic singer's property.

Michael Jackson on Thursday announces a series of concerts in London, England.

Jackson's company, MJJ Productions, filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against Julien's Auction House.

"The conduct of the defendants was malicious, fraudulent, extreme, outrageous and without any legal justification whatsoever," the suit said.

Julien's has scheduled a five-day auction for April to liquidate items from Jackson's former home, Neverland Ranch, including the gates, the singer's famous jeweled white glove and a stretch Rolls-Royce.

The singer's suit contends the auction house can't sell any of the items without his permission.

Word of the lawsuit is "news to us," said auctioneer Darren Julien.

"We have been accommodating any requests made by Michael Jackson for the past eight months," Julien said. "If it is true and he is stating that there are items he does not want sold, why would he have ever given us the items in the first place? We are an auction house, and that is all that we do. We are not a mover or storage facility."

Julien said he will continue with the auction. iReport.com: Show us your Michael Jackson moves

Jackson sold Neverland Ranch last year, and he has spent much of his time since his 2005 acquittal on child molestation charges living in Bahrain.

Jackson announced Thursday that he will perform 10 concerts in London, England, in July in what he described as a "final curtain call."  Watch the announcement Â»

"These will be my final shows performing in London," he said.
