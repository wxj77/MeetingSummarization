Legendary professional football coach and ESPN analyst Mike Ditka is recovering from a stroke he suffered Friday, the sports network said.

Ditka, 73, will not be on ESPN's football shows this weekend, the network said. But Ditka "wanted everyone to know he's OK," ESPN senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said via Twitter.

"I feel good right now and it's not a big deal," Ditka told the Chicago Tribune.

Ditka was playing cards at a country club when he found his hands "weren't working quite right." He then had problems speaking, the newspaper reported.

ESPN says it expects the coach to return to broadcasts soon.

Ditka is a Pro Football Hall of Famer and Super Bowl winning coach who has been with ESPN since 2004.

He is only the second person to win the Super Bowl as a player, assistant coach and head coach, according to a biography by the speaker's bureau that represents him.
