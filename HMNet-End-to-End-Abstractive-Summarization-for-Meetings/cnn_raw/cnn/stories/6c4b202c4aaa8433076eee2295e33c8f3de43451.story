(CNN) -- Real Madrid had two players and coach Jose Mourinho sent off as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Villarreal, offering hope to Barcelona in the race for the Spanish title.

Cristiano Ronaldo's goal looked to have sealed victory for the league leaders, only for Marcos Senna to salvage a point for the home side with seven minutes left.

After that defender Sergio Ramos was sent off for picking up a second yellow card for a foul on Nilmar before midfielder Mesut Ozil was dismissed two minutes later for dissent.

It was Real's second 1-1 draw in the space of four days after Malaga took a point from the Bernabeu on Sunday night, leaving Mourinho's team six points clear with 10 matches to play.

Barcelona will take heart from Real's stutter, having kept their chase up with a 5-3 win over Granada on Wednesday.

While Barca's talisman is Lionel Messi -- whose hat-trick in the Granada game saw him become the club's highest goalscorer of all time at the age of only 24 -- Real would be significantly weakened without Ronaldo.

His strike took his goal tally to 33 for the season, just one short of Messi, as Real seek to secure their first league crown since 2008.

Real are still favorites to claim the title, but their game against Barcelona on April 22 is looking ever more crucial.

Elsewhere, Bayern Munich booked their place in the final of the German Cup by beating Borussia Monchengladbach on penalties.

The game remained goalless after 120 minutes of football, but Bayern won 4-2 in the shootout to seal a clash with Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund on May 12.

Meanwhile, Napoli overcame a 2-1 aggregate deficit to beat Siena 2-0 and clinch a place in the Italian Cup final against Juventus.

An own goal from Simone Vergassola was added to by Napoli striker Edinson Cavani.

In the French Cup there were surprise defeats for Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain, beaten 3-1 at home by Lyon, and second-placed Montpelier, who lost 1-0 to third tier Ajaccio GFCO.
