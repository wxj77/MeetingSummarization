(CNN) -- Authorities in Fayetteville, North Carolina, are investigating the death of a pregnant soldier whose body was found Saturday morning in a motel, police said.

Spc. Megan Lynn Touma, 23, was a dental specialist from Cold Springs, Kentucky, according to a statement from Fort Bragg, where Touma was assigned to the 19th Replacement Company.

Fayetteville police found her body late Saturday morning when they responded to a call about a strong odor coming from one of the rooms. The body was sent to the state Medical Examiner's office in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to determine the cause of death.

Touma, who was seven months pregnant, arrived at Fort Bragg on June 12. In five years with the Army, she had served with the U.S. Army Dental Activity Clinic in Bamberg, Germany, and in Fort Drum, New York, before her assignment to Fort Bragg.

Touma is the second pregnant service member to die in North Carolina in recent months. The remains of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach and her fetus were found beneath in a fire pit January 11 in Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean's backyard.  Watch how police found body Â»
