(EW.com) -- The Mayans were wrong about the end of the world, and it looks like robot Armageddon is on hold, too.

Steven Spielberg had planned to make the film adaptation of the novel Robopocalypse with Anne Hathaway this summer, with a date already set for April 24, 2014. But it looks like that's not going to happen.

The project has been placed on indefinite hold. Drew Goddard, who wrote Cloverfield and penned "Cabin in the Woods" with Joss Whedon, had drafted a script for the story, in which a high-functioning artificial intelligence turns against mankind and wages all-out war to wipe us off the planet.

In addition to Hathaway, who would have played an unspecified role, "The Avengers" star Chris Hemsworth was also in talks to co-star. As recently as this morning, Hathaway's reps had said the project was a go.

But Spielberg has indicated boredom with action films in some recent interviews, and though no explanation was offered for the delay, aside from a statement from Spielberg's rep that it wasn't ready and was too expensive to move forward without a polished script, the "Lincoln" filmmaker may simply not be as enamored with the brutal extinction story as he once was.

DreamWorks purchased the rights to Daniel H. Wilson's novel well before it was published in June 2011.

It was originally set to be ready for this July, but last may 20th Century Fox (which is co-financing the film with DreamWorks, and Disney's Touchstone distributing) announced it would be pushed to April 2014.

Now ...? It's a question of when the robot revolution will take place, but if.

For sci-fi fans, that's not a good thing.
