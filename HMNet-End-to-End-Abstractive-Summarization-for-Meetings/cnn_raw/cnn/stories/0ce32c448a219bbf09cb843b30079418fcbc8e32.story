(CNN) -- If you bet on the princess, you win.

Monaco's Princess Gabriella Therese Marie was born at 5:04 p.m. (11:04 a.m. ET) Wednesday, beating her brother Jacques Honore Rainier into the waking world by two minutes, the royal family announced on Facebook.

The twins are the first children born to Charlene Wittstock, the former South African Olympic swimmer who married Prince Albert II in 2011. Their birth took place at the Princess Grace Hospital Monaco, named after Albert's mother -- and late legendary Hollywood actress -- Grace Kelly.

"The Princess and the children are doing well," the royal family said.

Prince Albert hadn't been married before, but he did have two children born out of wedlock in 1992 and 2003.

Yet it's the twins born to Wittstock who will get first crack at the throne, because Monaco law dictates that "succession passes, upon death or abdication, to the direct legitimate (descendant) of the previous prince."

And in this case, it would be Albert's son Jacques, even though he arrived after his sister.

While Gabriella will be the "second child in the line of succession," according to the royal family, Jacques "is the Crown Prince" and receives the title of Marquis of Baux (in Provence). Princess Gabriella is now known as the Countess of Carlades (in Auvergne).
