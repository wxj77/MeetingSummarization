(CNN) -- Didier Defago is hitting form just at the right time.

The reigning Olympic downhill champion produced a storming run in the Super-G on Kitzbuehel's famous Hahnenkamm mountain on Sunday to claim only the fourth World Cup win of his career.

The 36-year-old Swiss racer crossed the line in a time of one minute 10.38 seconds, edging out America's Bode Miller by just 0.05 seconds.

Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal and Max Franz of Austria finishing joint third after finishing 0.15 off Defago's pace.

"When you push so hard in your run, you cross the finish line and you have this something inside that needs to go out," Defago said, FIS-SKI.com reported.

"It's a great feeling... it must be all the energy I collected over the months that need to go out.

"I was not sure my run would be fast enough to win until the very end of the race but when I came down and I saw that I beat Bode and Aksel I knew I had a good run."

Defago's last win came in a downhill race in Bormio, Italy in 2011, but he will head to Sochi for the Winter Olympics, which get underway on February 7, with renewed hope that he can successfully defend the downhill title he won in Vancouver.

It was also a good day for Switzerland in Cortina, Italy as Lara Gut won the final women's Super-G race before Sochi.

Gut's time of one minute 27.81 seconds was 0.12 seconds better than Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein while Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch was third, 0.61 seconds behind the Swiss.
