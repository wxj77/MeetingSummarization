(CNN) -- London's Wembley Stadium could host the climax of the 2020 European Championship Finals, CNN has learned.

UEFA president Michel Platini is keen to revolutionize the tournament by holding matches across several European cities rather than just one or two countries.

Platini is understood to have held talks with FA chairman David Bernstein last week about the semifinals and final being held in English capital.

The Frenchman is keen for one city to host the final stages of the tournament with London a huge draw following its recent triumph in hosting the 2011 Champions League Final and more recently, the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The FA's chance of landing the showpiece event depends on whether Turkey, which is also keen to host the event, wins the right to host the Olympics in the same year.

London successfully hosted the 2011 European Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona.

That clash contributed to a record turnover of $532 million for UEFA and a profit after of tax of around $65 million, which was up from $14.5 million from the previous year.

That game brought in $17.8 million for the FA and the governing body has already agreed a fixed rental price for next season's Champions League Final.
