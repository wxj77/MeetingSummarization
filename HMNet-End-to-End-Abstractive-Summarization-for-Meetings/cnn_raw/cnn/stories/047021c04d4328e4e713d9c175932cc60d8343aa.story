New York (CNN) -- A mother abducted her eight biological children from a New York foster care agency during an authorized visit, authorities announced Tuesday.

Shanel Nadal, 28, fled with her seven sons and one daughter from the Queens facility on Monday afternoon, police said.

The abducted boys are all apparently named after their biological father, Nephra Payne, 34.

They are Nephra Payne, 11; Nephra Ceo Payne, 10; Nephra John Payne, 9; Nephra Shalee Payne, 6; Nephra Rahsul Payne, 6; Nephra Umeek Payne, 5; and Nephra Yahmen Payne, 4.

The lone girl was identified as Nefertiti Payne, 11 months.

The New York Police Department said Nadal may be traveling with the children's biological father in a black 1996 Chevrolet Suburban with license plate number EXZ5896.

Despite the one-day lag between the abduction and the announcement, New York City's Administration for Children's Services assured the public it had been investigating the incident since it occurred.

"ACS and our foster care agency began working with the NYPD immediately after the mother absconded with the children from a visit at the foster care agency yesterday," the ACS said in a statement.

The statement made no mention of how Nadal escaped or why the children had been placed in foster care.

CNN's Dominique Dodley contributed to this report.
