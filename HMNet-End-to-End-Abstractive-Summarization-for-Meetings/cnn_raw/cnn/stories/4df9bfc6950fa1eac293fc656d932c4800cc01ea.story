(CNN) -- A Disney stunt performer died Monday night after suffering an injury during a rehearsal, company and local officials said.

A performer was injured during rehearsal for the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular at Hollywood Studios.

Walt Disney World spokeswoman Zoraya Suarez said the performer was injured while performing a tumbling roll for the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular at Disney's Hollywood Studios, part of the Orlando, Florida, theme park.

It was the third fatal incident at the park in less than two months. Earlier this month, a performer was injured in a pirate show and later died. In July, two monorail trains collided, killing a driver.

"'We feel a sense of loss for these valued cast members," Suarez said. She said a review would be conducted on each incident. Performers receive extensive training, she said.

The Orange County Sheriff's Department identified the performer in the latest incident as Anislav Varbanov, 30, and said he had been pronounced dead at a hospital.  Watch a report on the incident Â»
