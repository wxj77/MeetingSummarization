(CNN) -- If you're going to photograph Olivia Wilde, she's going to make sure you get the full picture.

So, in the September issue of Glamour magazine, that meant getting in a breast-feeding photo as well.

The 30-year-old actress attended the shoot with her infant son, Otis, whom she welcomed with fiance Jason Sudeikis in April. In one image, she feeds her firstborn in a diner while wearing a Roberto Cavalli gown -- which, OK, isn't exactly how she does it at home.

"Being shot with Otis is so perfect because any portrait of me right now isn't complete without my identity as a mother being a part of that," Wilde explained. "Breast-feeding is the most natural thing. I don't know, now it feels like Otis should always be on my breast."

To Wilde, the photograph depicts "that multifaceted woman" that "we know we can be," she went on.

"You can be someone who is at once maternal and professional and sexy and self-possessed," Wilde said. "(But) I mean, I certainly don't really look like that when I'm (typically) breast-feeding. And there's usually a diaper involved."

After the pictures were shared online, Wilde joked via Twitter that "Otis ordered milkshakes. Luckily I had some on me. Then he peed on my dress. Good kid. #boobfood #whennaturecalls."

She also thanked Glamour for "knowing there's nothing indecent about feeding a hungry baby."

As far as her relationship with Otis' dad, actor and "Saturday Night Live" alum Sudeikis, Wilde sounds just as content as she looks in her photo.

"We're engaged, but no specific plans yet," Wilde said. "We just have to find the time to put it together. In many ways, a child is more of a commitment. We are fully committed and really happy as a family. And there's no definition of the 'normal family' anymore. Kids today are growing up with so many different definitions of family. I guess what I'm saying is that I don't feel any pressure to do it. But I think it will be really fun."
