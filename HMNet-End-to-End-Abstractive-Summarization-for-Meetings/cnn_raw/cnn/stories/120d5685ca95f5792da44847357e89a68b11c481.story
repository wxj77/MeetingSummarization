(CNN) -- The legendary rock band KISS becomes the next big act to make an extended stop in Las Vegas.

The group, which is in the middle of a summer tour with Def Leppard, will play nine nights in The Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Las Vegas in November.

"What happens in Vegas will not stay in Vegas, not if we have anything to do with it," KISS co-founder Gene Simmons said. "We intend to blow the roof off the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino."

The Vegas miniresidency is a first for KISS, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary as a band.

Extended stays in Las Vegas are proving profitable for a growing list of music acts, including Olivia Newton John and Britney Spears. Both singers have filled Vegas venues for weeks at a time this year.

KISS, known for its fireworks and over-the-top energy and volume, "will unleash its signature elaborate set designs, jam-packed set list, intense pyrotechnics and much more for nine of the biggest shows in KISS performance history," the Hard Rock news release said.

While KISS usually plays for tens of thousands of fans in arena and stadium shows, the Vegas shows will be much more intimate, with less than 4,000 seats. The schedule includes three shows a week for the first three weeks of November.

Simmons, 64, and Paul Stanley, 62, have been with the band since it formed. Eric Singer first joined as drummer in 1991 and lead guitarist Tommy Thayer was added 12 years ago.
