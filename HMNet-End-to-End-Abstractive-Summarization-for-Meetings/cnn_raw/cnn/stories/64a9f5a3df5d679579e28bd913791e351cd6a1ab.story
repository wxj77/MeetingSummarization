(CNN) -- NBC's "The Voice" had a voting snafu this week and the show addressed the issue on the air Wednesday night.

Fans trying to vote online and via text message had difficulty casting their votes via the show's well-established vote-tallying company, Telescope.

The network says the issues would not have resulted in a different outcome in terms of which contestants are eliminated. "Voice" host Carson Daly opened tonight's live show by bringing up the voting issue and introducing Telescope CEO Jason George. "Tonight we'd like to be completely upfront with you," Daly said. "We noticed some inconsistencies with this week's texting and online voting."

Telescope also manages the voting for shows like Fox's "American Idol" and "The X Factor." "Our system caught an inconsistency in a portion of this week's voting data," George said in a statement. "For fairness, those votes have been removed from Monday and Tuesday's results, but we want to assure fans and artists alike that this in no way affected the outcome for any team."

NBC added in a statement: "On this week's episodes of The Voice, we encountered issues with the systems used for online and SMS voting. We are addressing both issues, and in an abundance of caution are not counting the votes that may have been affected. Telescope, the independent company that administers voting for the show, has certified that removing those votes does not affect the outcome for any team."

Four contestants will be eliminated on tonight's edition of the NBC hit series, paring the field down to the Top 12.
