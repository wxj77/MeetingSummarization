(CNN) -- AC Milan captain Gennaro Gattuso has been charged for head-butting Tottenham's assistant manager at the end of his side's Champions League loss on Tuesday.

Football's European governing body told CNN on Thursday that Gattuso faces a charge of "gross sporting misconduct" after he clashed with former Milan player Joe Jordan following the 1-0 first-leg defeat at the San Siro.

UEFA said the 33-year-old's case will be discussed at a meeting of its disciplinary and control panel in Switzerland on Monday.

The former Italy midfielder was already due to miss the return leg of the last-16 tie at White Hart Lane in March because of an earlier booking during the game, but according to UEFA's rules this could be extended to at least a three-match suspension.

Why Gattuso has to lose his cool

In a tense encounter between the Italian Serie A and English Premier League sides, Gattuso had already clashed with 59-year-old Jordan before the incident with the former Scotland international on the sidelines at the final whistle.

The ex-Glasgow Rangers player also came to blows with Spurs goalscorer Peter Crouch during the match, and received a yellow card for a foul on South Africa midfielder Steven Pienaar.

However, Gattuso has apologized for his behavior towards Jordan and said he would have to accept the consequences of his actions.

"I lost my head and I'm taking responsibility because I did something I shouldn't have done," he told reporters.

"I made a mistake doing what I did to an older person, and that's it. I will wait and see what UEFA decides now."
