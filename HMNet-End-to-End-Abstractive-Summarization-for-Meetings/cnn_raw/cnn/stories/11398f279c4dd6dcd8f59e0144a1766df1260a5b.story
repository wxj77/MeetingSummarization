Washington (CNN) -- An underground transformer fire about two blocks from the White House prompted evacuations of two hotels and disrupted a wedding, officials said Saturday night.

Flames shot up through a sidewalk after 8 p.m., said Pete Piringer, a spokesman for the District of Columbia Fire Department.

The Willard Intercontinental and the W hotels were evacuated, and a couple of blocks were without power, Piringer said.

As a precaution, a nearby wedding ceremony with hundreds of guests was relocated to the JW Marriott hotel as firefighters battled the blaze. The couple completed their ceremony at the hotel.

The fire was extinguished by 9 p.m., and power was restored by 10 p.m.

No injuries were reported.
