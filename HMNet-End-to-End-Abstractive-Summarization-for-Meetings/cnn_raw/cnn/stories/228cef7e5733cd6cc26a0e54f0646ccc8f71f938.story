(CNN) -- George Clooney will soon be a brief part of "Downton Abbey," and for a good cause.

A rep for the show's UK network, ITV, says the actor will appear in a "Downton"-related film made for ITV's charity program, "Text Santa."

The annual fund-raiser drums up support for six UK charities, including Alzheimer's Society and Teenage Cancer Trust.

No other details were provided regarding the special program, but ITV said that Clooney will not be in any episodes of the show. If he were, he'd be among old friends. Clooney cast "Downton Abbey's" Hugh Bonneville (Robert Crawley) in his 2014 World War II film, "The Monuments Men."

The fifth season of "Downton Abbey" will premiere in the United States on PBS on January 4.
