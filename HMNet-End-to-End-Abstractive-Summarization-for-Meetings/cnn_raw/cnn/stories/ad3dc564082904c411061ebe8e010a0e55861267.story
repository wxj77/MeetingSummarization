(CNN) -- Students and staff will be allowed to return to a northeast Ohio college campus Monday evening, following a bomb threat that had forced its evacuation earlier in the day, according to the school's website.

The bomb threat had forced the evacuation of Stark State College in North   Canton, Ohio. Some classes were canceled and a building evacuated at Kent State University at Stark, which shares the campus with Stark State, according to messages posted Monday on the two schools' official websites.

Separately on Monday morning, hazardous materials teams were sent to Ohio State University's main campus in Columbus after a professor received a letter containing a white powder, but no readings indicated it posed any danger, a campus police official said.

The professor who received the letter is doing fine and had suffered no  harmful effects from the powder, said Campus Police Deputy Chief Richard  Morman.

The hazmat crews were called to  the second floor of a physics building, according to CNN affiliate WBNS.

There was no word Monday afternoon about whether the incidents at the two campuses, which are about 130 miles apart, were thought to be connected.

The posting on the Stark State website said that authorities had been cleared by authorities to reopen and resume normal operations by 5 p.m.

Kent State University at Stark posted a message on its official website Monday morning saying its fine arts building was closed until 5 p.m. and ordering students and campus personnel "to evacuate the building immediately," but other classes and campus offices were  to remain open as scheduled. No further updates from Kent State-Stark had been posted as of midafternoon Monday.
