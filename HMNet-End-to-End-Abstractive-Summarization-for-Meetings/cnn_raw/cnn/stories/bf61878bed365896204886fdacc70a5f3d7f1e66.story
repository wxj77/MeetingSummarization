(CNN) -- Virginia prosecutors said Monday they will not pursue murder charges against three people in connection with the death of Kevin Quick, an auxiliary police officer.

Leslie Hope Casterlow, 49; Anthony Darnell Stokes Jr., 31; and Halisi Uhuru still face felony gang participation charges, Goochland County Commonwealth's Attorney Claiborne Stokes' office said.

Authorities didn't say why the murder prosecution won't be pursued.

Quick, 45, was an auxiliary police captain and resident of Waynesboro, a small town west of Charlottesville. Auxiliary officers aren't paid but hold ranks, have badges and carry firearms like full-time officers.

He was last seen the night of January 31 after he left the house he shared with his mother. His remains were found last Thursday.

Authorities have not revealed the cause of death or explained any connection between Quick and the suspects.

Two other suspects arrested last Tuesday, siblings Daniel Mathis and Mersadies Shelton, are held each on charges of felony grand theft for allegedly stealing Quick's vehicle, a 1999 Toyota 4Runner. They are not being charged in connection with Quick's death.

Another man, Anthony Lee White, 22, was arrested after the others were already in custody, and White also will face gang participation charges, Stokes' office said.
