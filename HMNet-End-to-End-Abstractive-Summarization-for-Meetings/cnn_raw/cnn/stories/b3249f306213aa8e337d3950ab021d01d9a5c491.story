(CNN)On "Family Matters" we knew him as Eddie Winslow.  This week, as inmate 402282.

Actor Darius McCrary was jailed on Wednesday for failure to pay child support.

He wasn't behind bars long, McCrary was released before the day was over, according to Carrie Rudzki with the jail in Oakland County, Michigan.

McCrary, 38, took to Twitter as news of his arrest spread.

"All I'm trying to do is raise my son," he tweeted.  "#BeingDadIsNotAnOption"

But critics were quick to recall when McCrary's Eddie character got into trouble on the show and used it to take a swipe at him.

"Ohhh Eddo..." tweeted Happy Famiree.  "I guess family doesn't matter."

But McCrary wasn't having it.

"I've spent all my career in Hollywood and have NEVER been arrested once," he said on Twitter.  "I  fly in to Oakland County 2 resolve issues and u guys got jokes?"

Apparently stung by the reporting, McCrary released a string of tweets defending himself, including one where he appears to compare himself to a late civil rights leader.

"If they did it to Dr. King...  Who am I?" McCrary said.

McCrary has stayed busy since his days on "Family Matters" in the 1980s and 1990s, according Internet Movie Database.  IMDb lists 51 acting credits, including stints on "Anger Management" with Charlie Sheen and a two-year run on "The Young and the Restless" as Malcolm Winters.   He provided the voice for the Autobot Jazz on "Transformers."
