(CNN) -- A second woman found dead during the weekend in East Cleveland has been identified, authorities said Tuesday.

She is Shetisha Sheeley, 28, of Cleveland -- one of three people found dead within a few blocks from each other.

Mayor Gary Norton believes the killings happened over 10 days and that the same assailant is responsible. Another victim had been identified earlier as Angela Deskins, 38, of Cleveland.

A suspect, 35-year-old Michael Madison, was formally charged Monday in the deaths.

Mayor warns: 'There might be more victims'

"I don't know why this person did what they did to my daughter, but I just want everybody just to pray for me. Because this is really, really hard on me right now," Kim Sheeley, Shetisha Sheeley's mother, told CNN affiliate WEWS.

Wiping tears from her eyes, she said her 25-year-old son was murdered some seven months ago.

"It was really hard. It's taken a toll out of me. I don't know what else to say, but thank you all for whoever is praying for me," she told WEWS.
