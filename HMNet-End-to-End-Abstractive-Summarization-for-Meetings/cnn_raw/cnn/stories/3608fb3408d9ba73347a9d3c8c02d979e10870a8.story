(CNN) -- This weekend sees a fixture which football fans across the world look forward to at the start of every season, with Spanish archrivals Real Madrid and Barcelona going head-to-head at the Bernabeu Stadium.

On Saturday, the two sides will clash in the match which is known as "El Clasico", with two of the sport's finest players facing off -- Real's Cristiano Ronaldo and Barca's Lionel Messi.

Real to topple Barca in 'El Clasico' clash?

Clashes between the two teams are always heated affairs and Jose Mourinho's Real will be out for revenge after suffering a two-leg defeat in the preseason Spanish Super Cup in August.

In recent years Barca have dominated Spanish football, winning three consecutive First Division titles and being crowned champions of Europe in 2009 and 2011.

But it is Mourinho's men who currently top the table, and Josep Guardiola's Barca will be looking to close the three-point gap which currently exists between them and Real with victory in Madrid.
