(CNN) -- Welcome back, Frank Ocean.

It's been two years since the Grammy-winning artist made a stellar debut with his album "Channel Orange," and on Friday he quietly delivered a new song called "Memrise."

While many musicians would roll out the PR red carpet for a new track, Ocean unveiled the meditative "Memrise" without any fanfare on his Tumblr. You can listen to the single on his site, frankocean.tumblr.com.

The mood of "Memrise" feels similar to some of Ocean's work on "Channel Orange," but it's experimental in his delivery. Rather than simply singing all of the song's lines, Ocean employs a more staccato, spoken-word delivery, saving his distinct vocals to close out the song.

The lyrics themselves are intimate, telling the story of a sensual relationship.

"I memorized the wayward expressions/Never look down/Never let you see me down. I memorized the way no directions," Ocean says in the song. "Can I come over now, I'd like to stay a little while. I memorized your body exposed/I could f*** you all night long/From a memory alone."

It's unclear if "Memrise" is a sign of what's to come on Ocean's highly anticipated second album, but it's a relief for fans who've been eager to hear more. In 2012, "Channel Orange" was a critical success, winning the Grammy for best urban contemporary album, and rumors of what's to come from the artist have been circling ever since.

What we do know is that Ocean has been hard at work. Billboard reports that he's been clocking studio time with producers such as Hit-Boy and Rodney Jerkins.
