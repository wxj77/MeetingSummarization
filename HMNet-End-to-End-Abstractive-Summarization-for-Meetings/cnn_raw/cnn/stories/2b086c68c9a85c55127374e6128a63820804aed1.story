(CNN) -- David Petraeus, who resigned as director of the Central Intelligence Agency after the revelation of an extramarital affair, has been named a visiting professor at Macaulay Honors College at the City University of New York, the school's chancellor said Tuesday.

Petraeus will assume the position in August, Matthew Goldstein, the chancellor, said. The university did not provide specifics about what Petraeus would be teaching.

In a statement, the retired Army general indicated he will lead an economic seminar.

"I look forward to leading a seminar at Macaulay that examines the developments that could position the United States -- and our North American partners -- to lead the world out of the current global economic slowdown," he said.

Petraeus apologizes for affair

Petraeus, who once ran the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from his CIA post in November.

He resigned after admitting he had had an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, a fellow West Point graduate who spent months studying the general's leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

The affair came to light during an FBI investigation of "jealous" e-mails Broadwell reportedly sent to another woman.
