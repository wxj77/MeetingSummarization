(CNN) -- Real Mallorca's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League were dented by a 1-0 defeat away to Spanish strugglers Tenerife on Monday night.

Gregorio Manzano's islanders dropped out of the top four following the weekend's games, and Nino's early goal for relegation-threatened Tenerife meant they stayed fifth, two points behind Sevilla.

Tenerife moved up to third from bottom, still a point away from safety as they seek to avoid an immediate return to the second division, after doubling their points tally earned from the previous eight matches.

Last season's top scorer Nino netted his sixth goal of the 2009-10 campaign in the 14th minute as he ran onto Mikel Alonso's pass and buried his shot from the edge of the area despite claims of offside from the visitors.

Nino missed a chance from a similar position soon after, and in the second half he was denied by Israeli goalkeeper Dudu Aouate, who also did well to save Julian Omar's rising shot.

Mallorca substitute Pierre Webo headed wide with 12 minutes to go as his team, who have a 100 percent home record, extended a poor away run of just one win in 12 trips.

Champions Barcelona lead Real Madrid by two points following Sunday's shock defeat by Atletico Madrid, while Valencia are third a further 10 points adrift.
