(CNN) -- Call it keeping up with the next generation of Kardashians.

OK, technically, Kendall Jenner is not a Kardashian. But the 18-year-old is a half-sibling of the Kardashian sisters and can be frequently seen on the E! reality series "Keeping Up with the Kardashians."

She also seems to be taking after her older sisters in stirring up buzz via her fashion sense.

On Sunday, Jenner and her 16-year-old sister, Kylie, who were hosting the 2014 MuchMusic Video Awards, appeared on the red carpet before the Canadian awards show. Though much has been written about their hosting (not all good), even more has been said about Kendall's red carpet dress, a Fausto Puglisi number that featured splits up to the thigh.

Jenner's pelvic bones were plainly visible and gave the impression that she was not wearing any underwear. Probably only her stylist knows for sure.

Jenner was proud of the fuss. The aspiring model tweeted a pic of the dress, saying, "Why do one slit when you can do TWO!?"

Why indeed? Jenner got the attention she clearly was going for, including a BuzzFeed feature that proclaimed that Angelina Jolie's one-legged slitted gown was so 2012.

"2014," said the site, "is all about the pelvis."

What do you think about Jenner's dress? Haute or not?
