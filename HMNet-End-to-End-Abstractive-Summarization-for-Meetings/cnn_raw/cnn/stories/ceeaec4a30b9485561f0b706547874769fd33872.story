(CNN)  -- Sierra Leone international Rodney Strasser scored a vital goal five minutes from time to send AC Milan five points clear as Serie A resumed Thursday after its short mid-winter break.

Strasser first goal in the Italian top-flight gave Milan a 1-0 win over Cagliari in Sardinia to increase their lead in the title race as Lazio were held to a 0-0 draw at Genoa.

In the evening kickoff, Inter Milan gave new coach Leonardo a superb start with a 3-1 win at home to Napoli, who would have cut the gap on Milan at the top to three points with victory at the San Siro.

Brazilian Leonardo, who replaced Rafael Benitez, saw Thiago Motta  score twice with Esteban Cambiasso also on target.

Napoli replied through Michele Pazienza, as the win takes reigning champions Inter to within 13 points of their city rivals, but they have two games in hand.

Juventus' championship challenge hit the buffers after a humiliating 4-1 home defeat to mid-table Parma.

Juve's chances were hardly helped by the 17th minute dismissal of Felipe Melo for violent conduct.

But they were also undone by one of the own players, striker Sebastian Giovinco, who is out on loan to Parma this season.

He scored a double before defender Nicola Legrottaglie pulled a goal back for the Turin giants.

But Hernan Crespo's penalty sealed the three points before substitute Raffaele Palladino scored a fourth in added time.

The defeat leaves Juventus eight points adrift of Milan, who made their breakthrough late as new signing Antonio Cassano played in fellow substitute Strasser to net.

In other action, Roma leapfrogged Juventus into fourth after winning 4-2 against Catania, with Marco Borriello and Mirko Vucinic scoring two apiece.
