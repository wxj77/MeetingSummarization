(CNN) -- Firefighters early Thursday extinguished a massive blaze that scorched the exterior of a 40-story apartment building in Grozny, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported.

No one was killed or injured but dozens were evacuated from the skyscraper and nearby buildings, RIA Novosti said of the fire in the capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya. It quoted a spokesman for the republic's emergencies service.

RIA Novosti said preliminary information indicated the fire was caused by a short circuit. Plastic trimming on the exterior was destroyed. The building's interior was untouched, according to the news agency.

Wednesday, officials told CNN that no one was living at the building at the time of the fire. It was not clear whether those evacuated were workers or others temporarily in the building.

Most of the floors of the building -- the largest in Chechnya, and built just a few years ago, according to RIA Novosti -- were on fire, a police source told the news agency.

More than 100 firefighters battled the blaze.
