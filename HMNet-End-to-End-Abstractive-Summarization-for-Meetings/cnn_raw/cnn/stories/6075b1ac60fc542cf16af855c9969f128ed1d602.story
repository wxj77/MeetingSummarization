Usher is hosting a Senate fundraiser, but Bill Clinton is getting top billing.

The Atlanta-based singer and dancer will hold a campaign event for Georgia U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn on September 13, and the former President will be the fundraiser's marquee guest.

"Both in office and out, President Clinton has been a tireless advocate for Georgia families and a force for consensus building and creative problem solving in Washington," Nunn said in a statement about Clinton's support. "I have been honored to work with him as CEO of President George H.W. Bush's Points of Light Foundation, and I am very grateful to have his support in this race."

Nunn is locked in a race with Republican David Perdue that could determine the balance of power in the Senate. Both are looking to succeed Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss, who is retiring at the end of this term.

Usher, whose full name is Usher Raymond IV, has worked with Nunn and Clinton in the past.

The Grammy-winning singer honored Nunn for her work with the Points of Light Foundation at a charity event in 2010 and has been a semiregular attendee at Clinton Foundation events since 2009. Usher's New Look Foundation also awarded Clinton its Service Legacy Award in 2010.

For his part, Clinton has kept up a busy endorsement schedule ahead of the 2014 midterm elections. As the Democrats' most popular and most requested endorser, he has hopscotched the country, making appearances with Democratic candidates and attending fundraisers.

The former President has already helped Senate campaigns in Kentucky and Arkansas, and on Tuesday, he is set to campaign for Dannel Malloy, Connecticut's incumbent governor, in New Haven, and Rep. Mike Michaud, Maine's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, in Portland. The former President will also campaign for Florida governor candidate Charlie Crist on Friday.
