Pittsburgh (CNN) -- Singer Elton John paid tribute to his friend and fellow AIDS-activist, Elizabeth Taylor, at a concert in Pittsburgh Wednesday night.

"Today I lost a friend and you lost a hero named Elizabeth Taylor," the singer told a cheering crowd at the Consol Energy Center. "She was not just a movie star, although she was a huge movie star and there will never be anyone like her again ... She was without a doubt one of the greatest people I've ever met in my life."

"She stood up when no one was prepared to stand up and be counted against AIDS," John continued. "She supported everybody in that with 1,000% of her body and her fiber. But most of all she loved people. She fought for the underdog. She was an incredible woman and I was privileged to have known her."

As John began to play the opening notes of his song "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" he said "God bless you, Elizabeth. God knows how we're going to replace you. This is for you and your beautiful memory and for all the people you helped and saved."

Taylor and John have been active for years in raising awareness about AIDS and HIV, as well as raising money for research and care for sufferers. John accepted an award on her behalf from the group she helped create, the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR), at the group's 25th annual black-tie benefit in February.

Taylor passed away early Wednesday at the age of 79.
