Los Angeles (CNN) -- Kanye West's "Yeezus Tour" is on hold because of a truck crash that destroyed his huge video screen, his spokesman said Thursday.

A custom-made video truss and 60-foot circular LED screen were damaged "beyond repair" when a tour truck wrecked on the road from Los Angeles to Vancouver, British Columbia, where West was scheduled to perform Thursday night, Gabe Tesoriero said.Â 

"This gear is central to the staging of 'The Yeezus Tour' and central to the creative vision put forth by Kanye West and his design team at DONDA," Tesoriero said.

It is "impossible" for West to perform "until these essential pieces can be re-engineered and refabricated," he said.

"Kanye West will not compromise on bringing the show, as it was originally envisioned and designed, to his fans."Â 

Thursday night's Vancouver performance, Sunday's concert in Denver and Tuesday's stop in Minneapolis are the only dates officially postponed for now.

The next show on the schedule is Thursday, November 7, at Chicago's United Center. A decision will be "announced shortly" about that one and future dates, the spokesman said.

CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.
