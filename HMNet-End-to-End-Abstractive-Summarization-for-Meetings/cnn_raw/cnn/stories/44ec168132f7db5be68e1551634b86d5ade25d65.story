(CNN) -- A World Health Organization doctor working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the virus, the agency said Monday.

The doctor is in stable condition in Freetown and will be evacuated shortly, it said. The organization did not say where the doctor would be taken.

The treatment center is located in the Kenema Government Hospital, which is run by the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation, the WHO said in a statement.

As of September 5, there have been 3,944 probable, confirmed, or suspected cases of the virus in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and 2,097 deaths, the WHO says.

The African Union called Monday for "a lot of support and solidarity from fellow African countries and from the international community" for member states affected by the disease.

Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, chairwoman of the AU, also warned against stigmatizing victims, communities, and countries, the AU said in a statement.
