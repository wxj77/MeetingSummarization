(CNN) -- Residents are still dealing with the aftermath of Irene -- a massive storm that pummeled the East Coast.

The storm killed 43 people from Florida to New England and some of the worst flooding struck Vermont, New Jersey and upstate New York.

More than 1.1 million customers were still without power Thursday from North Carolina to Maine, the U.S. Department of Energy said.

Relief organizations are working to help victims in Irene's path. There are ways you can help.

At least 1,300 people awoke Wednesday morning in Red Cross shelters up and down the East Coast. The Red Cross has provided about 54,000 overnight shelter stays since the storm hit.

"The storm may be over, but our work is far from done," said Gail McGovern, Red Cross president. "We expect this disaster relief operation to be a very large operation that will continue for several weeks."

The organization has served more than 680,000 meals and snacks and has handed out more than 29,000 relief items such as hygiene kits, mops and tarps.
