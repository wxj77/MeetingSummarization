(CNN) -- A pirate ship, bubble-blowing animated dragons and 3 million Lego bricks.

For families with young kids -- or just any one who values uniform snapability -- the new Legoland Hotel in California is irresistible.

The three-story, 250-room hotel, which opened last week at Legoland resort in California, is the only Legoland hotel in the United States. Two others are located in England and Denmark.

Sorry, the new hotel isn't built entirely out of tiny, brightly colored bricks. But it does have some 3,400 incredible sculptures created with approximately 3 million Lego pieces.

The wall behind the check-in desk? Created entirely from Lego Minifigures. The potted plant on the counter? More Legos.

Each room is decorated after one of three themes -- Pirate, Adventure or Kingdom (why no Space?) -- and all have a separate children's area with a bunk bed and trundle bed, accommodating up to three children.

Additional cute feature: rooms come with a treasure hunt game, keeping you, er, your kids, busy hunting for a Lego treasure chest.

If kids at Legoland wake up early from sheer plastic fever -- or if someone punctures a foot on one of those maddening little pieces in the middle of the night -- they can access the park before it opens at 10 a.m., ahead of the public.
