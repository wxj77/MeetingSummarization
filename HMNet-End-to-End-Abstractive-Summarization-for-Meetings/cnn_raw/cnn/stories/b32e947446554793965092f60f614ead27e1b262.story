(CNN) -- We're a little suspicious of Jimmy Kimmel now thanks to his numerous hoaxes, but he wouldn't joke about a baby, right?

On a pre-taped episode of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show," ABC's host of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" revealed that he and his wife of close to a year, Molly McNearney, are expecting their first baby together.

Even DeGeneres was a little skeptical when Kimmel confirmed his wife is pregnant, but Kimmel assured her that he was being serious -- "unless she's kidding," he quipped.

The late-night host, who married McNearney in 2013, has two kids from a prior marriage that lasted from 1988 to 2003.

With two-thirds of his brood already into adulthood, Kimmel, 46, admits it's going to be a little awkward to start again.

"I don't know where they are, but I hear they're doing great," Kimmel joked. "No, I have a 20-year-old son, and a 22-year-old daughter, and I've really forgotten everything. I was just with friends who just had a baby, and there are new ways to do things; you hold them by the front of the neck now!" (Those friends happen to be John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, who welcomed their first child, daughter Hazel, on February 16.)

Kimmel claims that when he broke the news of the impending arrival to his daughter, he said, "Listen, there's only so much love I have to give, and you're going to have to split it up with the new kid. There's a finite amount of love, and that's that. So they're dealing with it."

While the star might think it's "very weird" to have a kid at his age -- "I'm going to be one of those old dads!" he told DeGeneres -- his age has nothing on the baby names he's thinking of.

"I like the name Karate," he said. "I think Karate Kimmel has a great ring to it. ... (And) I would like the baby's middle name to be 'Effin.'"

To catch DeGeneres' full interview with Kimmel, tune in to her show on Wednesday.
