(CNN) -- A U.S. soldier who escaped Army custody while facing a rape charge in California has been returned to Los Angeles County, authorities said Monday.

Pvt. Daniel Brazelton, 20, who is accused of raping a 15-year-old girl in Los Angeles, was captured at a motel in Daytona Beach, Florida, late Friday. He was returned to California the next day.

Brazelton is being held on $325,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in Lancaster Court on March 23, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.

He escaped from military custody on February 11 while he was being returned to a jail in Hinesville, Georgia. He had been taken to nearby Fort Stewart for medical reasons, authorities said.

It was not clear whether Brazelton had retained defense counsel.
