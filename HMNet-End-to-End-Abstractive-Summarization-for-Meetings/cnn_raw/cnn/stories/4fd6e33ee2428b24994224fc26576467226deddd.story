(CNN) -- It's another slap heard around the world, albeit a legal one this time.

Two years after Wendi Deng made headlines for forcefully defending her husband -- News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch -- from a pie-throwing intruder in Britain's Parliament, she and their relationship are in the news again.

Murdoch is filing for divorce from Deng, his third wife, a spokesman for the media mogul confirmed Thursday.

It's not known what precipitated the split to end the marriage that began in 1999. Speculation, though, has swirled for months about the state of the couple's relationship.

The Chinese-born, Yale-educated Deng was very accomplished in her own right pre-Murdoch, even though critics jabbed her as a "gold digger" through her marriage to the media mogul.
