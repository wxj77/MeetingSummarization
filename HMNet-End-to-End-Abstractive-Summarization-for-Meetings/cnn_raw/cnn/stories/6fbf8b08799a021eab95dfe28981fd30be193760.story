(CNN) -- Kenyan pair Wilson Kipsang and Mary Keitany won the men's and women's races at the London Marathon Sunday to serve notice of their gold medal credentials for the Olympics later this year.

The race also acted as a trial race for selection for the Kenyan team for the London Games and Kipsang and Keitany were impressive winners on both counts.

Kipsang, who has run the second fastest time of all time, finished over two minutes clear of a class field to win in two hours, four minutes and 44 seconds -- just four seconds outside the course best set by compatriot Emmanuel Mutai in winning last year's race.

Fellow Kenyan Martin Lel outsprinted fellow former London champion Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia for second place to seal his place for the Olympic marathon which will take place over many of the same roads in the capital in August.

Keitany led a Kenyan sweep of the podium places as she defended her London title with a commanding performance.

Her time of two hours, 18 minutes and 36 seconds was a new Kenyan record.

2011 world champion Edna Kiplagat finished second, more than a minute adrift with world silver medalist Priscah Jeptoo a further 24 seconds behind in third.

Behind the elite runners over 37,000 started the 32nd staging of the famous race which finishes on The Mall in front of Buckingham Palace.

Prince Harry was at the finish to present trophies to winners.
