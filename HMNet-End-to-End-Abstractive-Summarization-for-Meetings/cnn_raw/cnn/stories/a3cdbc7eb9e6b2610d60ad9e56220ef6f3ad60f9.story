(CNN) -- The LPGA have confirmed that 25-year-old golfer Erica Blasberg has been found dead.

Blasberg has played on the LPGA Tour since 2004, and had recently participated in her first event of 2010 in Mexico where she tied for 44th in the Tres Marias Championship.

A native of California, Blasberg turned professional in 2004 and claimed one victory on the Duramed Futures Tour before qualifying for the LPGA Tour in 2005.

Blasberg's best performance was in 2008 when she recorded a joint eighth position at the SBS Open in Hawaii -- a career-best -- and claimed over $113,000 prize money.

The details of her death are not yet known, according to the LPGA.

Blasberg's agent, Chase Callahan of REP 1 Sports Group told the LPGA's official Web site: "We are devastated to learn of the passing of Erica Blasberg.

"To most of the world, Erica was known as a professional golfer, but she was more than that. She was a loving daughter to her parents and a compassionate and loyal friend.

"Erica had a good heart, was extremely kind and very thankful for what she had in her life. She lived out her dream of playing professional golf on the highest level on the LPGA Tour, allowing her to help inspire others.

"We are proud of Erica for everything she accomplished. This is a painful loss, we feel it in our hearts and we will miss her. Erica would want those close to her to celebrate the life she lived. We ask that you keep Erica and her family in your prayers."
