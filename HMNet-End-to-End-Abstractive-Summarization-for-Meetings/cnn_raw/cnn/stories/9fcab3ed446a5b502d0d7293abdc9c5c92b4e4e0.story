(CNN) -- He's started in a record 291 consecutive games, but Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre's streak could be intercepted by injury this weekend.

In a press conference Monday, Vikings head coach Brad Childress said Favre had two fractures, including a stress fracture, and was wearing an ankle boot.

"He's had ankle and heel problems for a long time, so that walking boot makes him a little bit more comfortable," Childress said.

The Vikings will play the New England Patriots this Sunday.

"I wouldn't rule anything out in terms of the end of the week," Childress said.

But he added, "You can't put a guy that's a sitting duck out there. ... His competitive nature, I'm sure, will come into it, but a lot of times you've got to protect people from themselves."

The Vikings are coming off a 28-24 loss Sunday to the Green Bay Packers.

"You feel like you've let everybody down," Favre said in a press conference after the game. "It's tough."

Childress said he's handling Favre's situation day by day. It's unclear whether Favre's marathon record will end this weekend.

"Once he's functional, he can play," the coach said.

Favre recently made headlines due to allegations that he sent explicit material to a woman who worked for the New York Jets when he was the Jets' quarterback two years ago.

The National Football League initiated an investigation into Favre's alleged actions after the sports website Deadspin.com reported in August that Favre sent voice messages, texts and pictures of his penis to Jets sideline personality and host Jenn Sterger in 2008.

Favre's record for most consecutive starts by any player in the history of the NFL spans about 19 seasons, according to NFL.com.
