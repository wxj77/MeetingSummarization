(CNN) -- Shia LaBeouf isn't the only sorry actor in Hollywood.

After the 27-year-old announced that he's performing in an art piece called "#IAmSorry" this week in Los Angeles, actors such as Jerry O'Connell and Emile Hirsch are turning LaBeouf's apologetic saga into a punchline.

On Wednesday, O'Connell actually opened his own exhibit right next to LaBeouf's called "#IAmSorryToo" for Funny Or Die.

.

BuzzFeed stopped by both LaBeouf's performance -- during which visitors take an "implement," such as a "Transformers" toy or bottle of cologne, into a small room where LaBeouf sits silently with a bag over his head -- and O'Connell's, and found that O'Connell could be guilty of plagiarizing LaBeouf's show.

Considering that LaBeouf is facing accusations of plagiarism with his "#IAmSorry" show anyway, O'Connell's rip-off of LaBeouf's exhibit is "is obviously the point," BuzzFeed notes.

Like LaBeouf, O'Connell's set-up involves a table of items that occasionally reference his career: where LaBeouf had nods to "Transformers," "Indiana Jones" and a copy of Daniel Clowes' book, "The Death-Ray," O'Connell included a DVD of "Stand By Me" and a toy kangaroo (2003's "Kangaroo Jack," anyone?).

But unlike LaBeouf, who never clarifies exactly what he's apologizing for, O'Connell was an open book. He, too, wore a paper bag over his head -- one saying "SUPER FAMOUS" instead of LaBeouf's "I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE" -- but eagerly apologized for "all the world's ills" and even offered one guy a taste of his sandwich.

O'Connell explained to BuzzFeed that he wasn't doing it to upset LaBeouf -- in fact, he found the actor's exhibit pretty inspiring.

"Everyone's talking about it, whether you want to call it art or a real apology, it's hilarious," O'Connell said. "He's getting people talking. I'm all for this artsy gallery thing. It's fun to parody because all I have to do here is sit with a bag on my head, crying, and saying, 'I sowwy.' But I have to tell you; it's freeing to continually apologize like he does. I get it."

Emile Hirsch does too. The "Lone Survivor" actor went on a tweet-spree Wednesday airing all of his regrets.

"I AM NOT FAMOUS TO BEGIN WITH," Hirsch joked. "I AM BEGINNING TO FEEL SLIGHTLY MORE FAMOUS. ... I TAKE IT BACK, STILL NOT FAMOUS."

And then: "I AM...CONFUSED ABOUT HOW FAMOUS OR NOT FAMOUS I MIGHT POTENTIALLY BE...ANYMORE... I AM...ACCIDENTALLY ON CAPS."

Just in case LaBeouf thinks Hirsch is laughing at him instead of with him, the actor clarified that "IN ALL FAMOUSNESS THOUGH, I LOVE SHIA, WHETHER OR NOT HE'S FAMOUS. ... I AM SORRY I EVEN SAID SORRY. NOT GONNA LIE, I AM ONLY ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT SURE OF MY ORIGINAL (FIRST) SORRY."

In December, LaBeouf was accused of plagiarizing Daniel Clowes' "Justin M Damiano," in his short film, "HowardCantour.com." The actor at first said that he'd been so absorbed in the creative process he neglected to give Clowes proper accreditation, but then he was also accused of plagiarizing his apologies.

All of these regrets makes us wonder: who do you want to see apologize next?
