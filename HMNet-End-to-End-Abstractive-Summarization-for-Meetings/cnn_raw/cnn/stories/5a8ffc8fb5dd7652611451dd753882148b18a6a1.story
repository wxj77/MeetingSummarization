LONDON, England (CNN) -- British singer Amy Winehouse has been charged with "common assault" in connection with an incident last September, and will appear in court later this month, Scotland Yard said Friday.

Amy Winehouse performs at last year's V Festival in Chelmsford, England.

In the incident, on September 26, the singer allegedly hit a fan at a charity ball, British media reported.

A spokesman for the 25-year-old Winehouse said in a statement that she "voluntarily attended a police station in London yesterday morning.

"She was questioned by appointment in relation to an accusation made after the Berkeley Ball last year.

"She was charged with common assault and will attend a court hearing in the coming weeks."

Winehouse is facing the possibility of another potentially damaging court case after husband Blake Fielder-Civil last month asked his lawyer "to commence divorce proceedings on the grounds of Amy's adultery," his lawyer, Henri Brandman, said.

That came after Fielder-Civil saw photos of her cavorting with another man during her recent holiday in the Caribbean, while he sat in a British jail.
