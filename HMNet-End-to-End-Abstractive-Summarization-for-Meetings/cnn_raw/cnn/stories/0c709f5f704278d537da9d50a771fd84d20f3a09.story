A suspected serial bank robber wanted in incidents in three East Coast states has been arrested in Medford, New York, the FBI said Tuesday.

Agents and New York police arrested Luis Alomar, 37, around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, the agency said in a statement. It didn't provide details of where he was arrested in the Long Island community or how he was located.

The FBI had sought the public's help Monday in finding Alomar, who is suspected of robbing 20 banks in New York, New Jersey and Delaware.

Alomar allegedly flashed a gun at tellers in some of the robberies, sometimes threatening to shoot them if they said anything, the FBI said.
