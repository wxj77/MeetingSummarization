(CNN) -- Just after 7 a.m. Tuesday in the fifth district of Kabul, Afghanistan, a suicide bomber struck a bus carrying Afghan police and civilians.

Afghan I-Reporter S. Samimi sent this photo of a bus struck by a suicide bomber on Tuesday.

At least 10 people were killed, including four children. I-Reporter S. Samimi was in his car on his way to work, only 100 meters from where the blast went off.

He jumped from his car, unsure of what had happened. Samimi asked people around him what was going on. Finally, the truth dawned on him.

Samimi, 23, grabbed his camera and made his way to the site of the attack.

He said it was difficult taking pictures because his whole body was shaking. It was the first suicide bombing he had ever witnessed.

Hands and limbs were scattered about the ground. Within minutes a crowd of hundreds had gathered around the bus, some of them family members of victims.

"People were screaming and crying," Samimi said. "The situation was so bad. So tragic. I am so sad about it."

Samimi said security guards were quickly on the scene and ordered him to stop taking pictures. He said at that point he was ready to leave.

Samimi, who works as a secretary, said he was too shaken to concentrate on the job. "I couldn't work well, because my condition was so bad after having seen a scene like that for the first time. It was so tragic."

He said he returned home to learn that one of his neighbors, a policeman, had been killed in the bombing. "I saw his family screaming and crying over his death," he said.

He talked about the bombing with his family. "They were so sad when they heard about what had happened and when they saw my pictures. People in the neighborhood are still crying."

Samimi explained why he sent his photographs to CNN.
