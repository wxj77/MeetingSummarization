(CNN) -- The world continues to mobilize to help victims after a massive earthquake and tsunami sparked a nuclear crisis in Japan.

Google is helping victims touch base with friends and loved ones. Its People Finder, which has tracked more than 606,800 records, allows users to look for victims or post information about people. It works in five languages.

As nations offer monetary aid, condolences and rescue teams, many people around the world are seeking ways to ease the burden on the Japanese government and people.

The humanitarian group World Vision has personnel on the ground distributing first-relief supplies such as water, diapers, blankets and powdered milk to victims and their children.

It also plans to establish one or more "child-friendly spaces" for kids "affected by disasters to resume normal childhood activities and experience structure and security that are often lost following emergency situations."

Follow World Vision's blog for updates, and visit its website or text "4JAPAN" to 20222 to send a $10 donation to the group. It will show up on your next mobile phone bill.

The American Red Cross made an initial financial contribution of $10 million to the Japanese Red Cross Society and plans to give more. The Japanese Red Cross is helping thousands of survivors in evacuation centers.

Save the Children sent emergency response teams to assist its staff in Japan. Donations to the group's Children's Emergency Fund will help preserve the welfare of young ones, who "are always the most vulnerable in a disaster," Eiichi Sadamatsu in central Tokyo said in a statement.

The organization has set up multiple child-friendly spaces and plans to set up more in the coming days. Text "JAPAN" to 20222 to donate $10 to Save the Children for Japan relief.

The U.S. Fund for UNICEF is also raising funds for child victims. A UNICEF team assessed the worst-hit areas of Japan to see where funds are most needed.

Other organizations taking advantage of texting donation options include Mercy Corps (text "MERCY" to 25383 to donate) and Convoy of Hope (text "TSUNAMI" to 50555 to make a $10 donation).

Globalgiving.org, another aid organization that allows donors to select the causes they want to support -- including climate change, economic development, human rights and disaster relief -- has established a Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Relief Fund.

Globalgiving will disburse funds to organizations providing aid and relief to victims. Text "JAPAN" to 50555 to donate $10 to the fund.

Among those organizations are Save the Children and the International Medical Corps. The corps sent a team of doctors to Sendai, where they will be delivering supplies, assessing needs and identifying communities that have not been reached.

ShelterBox has a response team working to deliver emergency shelters and lifesaving supplies to families in hard-hit areas. Government officials in Iwate Prefecture have requested 500 ShelterBoxes to families who lost their homes.

"In light of how many people are now displaced from their homes, our primary concern is making sure that our aid is available to those who need it most," Tom Henderson, ShelterBox founder and CEO, said in a statement.

Doctors Without Borders has a team of people on the ground to assist in the massive government-led relief effort. The organization has been providing medical consultations in evacuation centers in hard-hit areas.

The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee is working with the Japanese Jewish community to get emergency relief -- food, water and supplies -- to victims in the hardest-hit Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures.

Like many organizations, the JDC is accepting only monetary donations at this point. Visit the JDC's website to donate to its Japan/Pacific Emergency Relief Fund.
