(CNN) -- Vita Food Products says it is recalling more than 8,000 packages of its smoked salmon because the product may be contaminated.

The recall affects the Vita Classic Premium Sliced Smoked Atlantic Nova Salmon.

The Chicago-based company says 8,088 packages could be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause fatal infections to people with weakened immune systems, children and the elderly.

"To date, no confirmed illnesses or complaints have been reported by customers, although the company is closely monitoring the situation," the company said in a statement Friday.

The company says the salmon was sold throughout the country.

Grocery stores that received the salmon include Publix in Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama and Florida.

The salmon was also sold to Safeway stores in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia and California.

Genuardi's stores in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and Winn Dixie stores in Florida also got the salmon.
