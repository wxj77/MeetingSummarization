(CNN) -- Troubled actress Amanda Bynes is mentally competent to stand trial, California Judge James Bianco ruled during a court hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

The 27-year-old, who has been out of the spotlight since being placed under involuntary psychiatric hold four months ago, can now undergo criminal proceedings stemming from a DUI case.

Bynes was initially detained for a mental health evaluation in late July after her involvement in a residential disturbance and was then held in a psychiatric facility.

At the time, the "Easy A" star had a number of legal troubles, between the alleged DUI and three misdemeanor charges relating to an incident involving a bong allegedly tossed from her Manhattan apartment window in May.

In September, Bynes was moved from UCLA Medical Center to a private facility for "specialized treatment" at the recommendation of "the skilled health care professionals of UCLA," Bynes' parents said in a statement.

Now that Bianco has determined Bynes to be mentally competent, a progress report has been scheduled for January 7.

Bynes' parents, Rick and Lynn, have publicly stated that they have faith their daughter will "pull through" her current "situation."

"We appreciate everyone's heartfelt support, and we hope that she can get some privacy and the respect she deserves during this trying time," Lynn Bynes said in a statement to People magazine in October. "Both my husband and I love Amanda very much and we know she will get through this situation."
