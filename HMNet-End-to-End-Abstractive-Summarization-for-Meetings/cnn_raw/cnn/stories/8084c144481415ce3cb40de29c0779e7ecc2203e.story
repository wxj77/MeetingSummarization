Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A special court set up by Afghan President Hamid Karzai that had been prosecuting alleged electoral fraud by 62 parliament members has been dissolved, a presidential spokesman announced Wednesday.

Karzai said in a written statement that the country's electoral commission has final say over election outcomes, noting that Afghan courts cannot change electoral results.

The decree appears to put an end to months of legal wrangling over the legitimacy of roughly one quarter of the lawmakers in the country's lower house of parliament. But presidential spokesman Siamak Herawi said the commission will now review the court's findings to determine if any lawmakers need to be removed.

Critics of the Afghan president have long suggested that the creation of the now-dissolved special court had been part of an effort to stack the lower house with Karzai supporters.

Herawi declined to comment on those claims.

Meanwhile, four police officers were killed in southern Afghanistan during an inadvertent clash between NATO forces and Afghan police, according to an Interior Ministry statement on Wednesday.

The incident occurred in southern Kandahar province late Tuesday evening when NATO "mistakenly attacked a police checkpoint in Arghandab district," the statement said.

Two other police officers were also injured in the clash.

NATO says it is aware of the incident and an investigation is underway, according to International Security Assistance Force spokesman Capt. Pietro D'Angelo.
