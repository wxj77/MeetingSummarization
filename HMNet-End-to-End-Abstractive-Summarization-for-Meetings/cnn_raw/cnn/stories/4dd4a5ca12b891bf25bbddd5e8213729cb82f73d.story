(CNN)A medical helicopter carrying at least three people crashed late Thursday in Eufaula, Oklahoma, the Federal Aviation Authority  said.

It was flying from Tulsa to McAlester when it went down west of Lake Eufaula, near the Canadian River.

Three employees from medical air transport company EagleMed LLC were on board, according to FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford. FAA investigators are headed to the crash scene.

The McIntosh County Sheriff's Office is handling the crash for local law enforcement, but a spokeswoman said early Friday that it had no information to give out so far.

Earlier this week, an Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed in waters off the Florida Panhandle. All 11 service members aboard are believed dead, an Air Force official said Thursday.

The military has been working to recover the helicopter, which searchers found at the bottom of the Santa Rosa Sound near Eglin Air Force Base, as well as the bodies of all seven Marines and four Louisiana Army National Guard members who were aboard.
