(CNN) -- The trial for deposed Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, on Saturday was postponed until next month, state media reported. He faces charges involving the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising that led to his ouster.

Mubarak was convicted on the charges last year and sentenced to life in prison, but appealed the ruling and was granted a retrial.

A court ordered him released last month and placed under house arrest while he awaits a retrial.

Mubarak, 85, had been held since shortly after he was removed from power.

The ousted autocratic leader's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration. He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had said that he was physically unfit to stand trial.

Opinion: What Mubarak's release means

Mubarak's successor, Mohamed Morsy, was ousted from power this year. He was elected after Mubarak was toppled.

Egypt has been in turmoil since Morsy's removal from office, with the military battling Muslim Brotherhood members and other Morsy supporters.

Mubarak has pleaded not guilty to charges that he was complicit in the killings of protesters.

The ousted strongman spent three decades in charge of Egypt, the most populous Arab country.
