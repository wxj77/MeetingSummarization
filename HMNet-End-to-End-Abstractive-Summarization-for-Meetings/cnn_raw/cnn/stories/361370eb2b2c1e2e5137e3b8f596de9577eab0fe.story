London (CNN) -- France's Marion Bartoli has claimed the women's singles title at Wimbledon with a crushing 6-1 6-4 victory over Sabine Lisicki.

The 28-year-old, a losing finalist against Venus Williams in 2007, swept aside her German opponent in one hour 21 minutes to claim her first Grand Slam title.

Bartoli becomes only the second French woman to win Wimbledon in the open era, following in the footsteps of Amelie Mauresmo who won in 2006.

"I'm so happy I am holding the trophy. It has been my dream since I was six years old. I would like to thank everyone in the crowd who supported me today," Bartoli said.

For Lisicki, the vanquisher of Serena Williams in the fourth round and Agnieszka Radwanska in the semis, the disappointment was almost too much to bear.

"Marion has been in that situation before and she handed it perfectly. She deserves it. I hope I get the chance one more time as well." Lisicki said fighting back tears.

Both women started the match nervously losing their opening service games, but it was Bartoli whose game suddenly gelled while Lisicki, appearing in her first Grand Slam title, wilted under the pressure on a sweltering Center Court.

With her game in top gear, Bartoli took the first set in just 29 minutes. A more composed Lisicki returned from a bathroom break and held her opening service game of the second set, before Bartoli reeled off five games in succession.

Lisicki, who stunned Serena Williams in the fourth round, fought to the end holding serve in the seventh game and breaking Bartoli as she served for the match in the next.

Another hold from the German made the score 5-4, but at the second time of asking Bartoli made no mistake, serving out the match to love and finishing with an ace.
