(CNN) -- Singer Fantasia Barrino gave birth to a boy in North Carolina on Tuesday, her representative said.

Dallas Xavier Barrino, weighing 7 lbs 9 ounces and measuring 21 inches, was born at Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte, according Sherlen Archibald.

"I feel so blessed that my son Dallas Xavier was born healthy, and is a wonderful new addition to our family," Barrino said, who also has a 10-year-old daughter. "I thank all my fans for their well wishes and continued support."

The 2004 "American Idol" winner announced her pregnancy in August at a Florida concert. She has not said who the father is.

The past 18 months have been difficult for the 27-year-old Barrino, who acknowledged a relationship with a married man in the summer of 2010. She initially denied knowing Antwaun Cook was married.

She was treated at a Charlotte, North Carolina, hospital for a "sleep aid" overdose several days after Cook's wife filed a child-custody petition that included allegations of the affair.

Barrino later testified in the child custody case that she knew from the first day of her relationship with Cook that he was married and still living with his wife, according to court records.

Barrino's raw talent as a songstress, combined with her hard-luck story as a teenage mother, won her many fans, starting with her winning the third season of "American Idol."

Her six-year-long entertainment career has been pockmarked with adversity, including being sued by her own father and well-publicized financial troubles.
