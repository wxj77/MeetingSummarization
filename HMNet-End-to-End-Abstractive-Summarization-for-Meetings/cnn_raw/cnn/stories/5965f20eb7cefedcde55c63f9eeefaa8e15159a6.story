(CNN) -- At Timothy Busfield and Melissa Gilbert's Wednesday wedding, the bride wore red.

Strapless red, to be exact.

The former "Little House on the Prairie" actress tied the knot with "thirtysomething's" Busfield in a private ceremony, Gilbert's rep told CNN. The couple held the joyous occasion at San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara.

According to People, Gilbert, 48, and Busfield, 55, got engaged over the holidays.

Another source whispered to E! News that Busfield and Gilbert have known each other "for quite some time, as their paths have crossed off-and-on over the past 20 years."

This is the third marriage for both newlyweds. Busfield has three children from prior relationships, whereas Gilbert's a mom of two.

CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.
