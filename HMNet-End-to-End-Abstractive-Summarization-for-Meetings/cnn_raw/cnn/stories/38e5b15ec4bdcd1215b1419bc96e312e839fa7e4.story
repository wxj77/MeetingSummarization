Officer Darren Wilson recently married another member of the Ferguson Police Department, a source close to Wilson said.

According to a St. Louis County marriage license, Wilson on October 24 married Barbara Lynn Spradling, with whom he shares a home in St. Louis.

Sparse information was available from the marriage license and application.

Wilson, 28, is nine years younger than his wife and had a previous marriage end in divorce, dissolution or annulment, the application says. This was Spradling's first marriage.

Municipal Judge Christopher Graville performed the service in Oakland, about 15 miles south of Ferguson, the marriage license says.

Wilson's shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown is being investigated by a St. Louis County grand jury that will decide whether the officer will face charges. He is on paid administrative leave.
