(CNN)The New Kids on the Block are hangin' tough on nostalgia.

The boy band, colloquially known as NKOTB, announced they're going back on tour this summer with special guests R&B group TLC and rapper Nelly.

The pop group revealed Tuesday that "The Main Event" tour will kick off May 1 in Las Vegas, and hit 40-plus cities in the U.S. and Canada. Tickets can be purchased starting January 31.

This is not the first time NKOTB has combined forces in the name of '90s sentimentality: In recent years, they've also toured with fellow boy bands such as the Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees and Boyz II Men.

The news comes on the heels that TLC is attempting to fund their new -- and final -- album via a Kickstarter campaign.

"There's no better way than to do it with our fans; they made all of this possible anyway," Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins said in a video, with Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas by her side.

The third member of the multiplatinum group,  Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, was killed in a car accident in 2002.
