(CNN) -- Jordan's Queen Rania was recuperating in a New York hospital Monday after she underwent a medical procedure to correct an irregular heart rhythm.

"The procedure went very smoothly and Her Majesty is well and in good spirits," the Royal Court in Amman said in a statement Monday.

She will remain hospitalized for two nights while she recovers before returning home later in the week, the palace said.

Rania was in New York with her husband, who is attending the United Nations General Assembly.

Rania's procedure involved placing a catheter through a vein to the heart. An electric current was then used to stop the disturbance of electrical flow through the heart, the palace said. As a result, the heart's normal rhythm was restored, it said.

The procedure is used to treat premature ventricular contractions -- extra, abnormal heartbeats that begin in the heart's two lower pumping chambers. These extra beats disrupt the regular heart rhythm, sometimes causing patients to feel a flip-flop or skipped beat in their chests, a definition on the Mayo Clinic's website says. The site says premature ventricular contractions are common and occur in most people at some point.

Most people with premature ventricular contractions and an otherwise normal heart don't need treatment.
