Bombs exploded near two shuttered embassies in Tripoli Thursday morning, according to state media and eyewitness accounts.

Libyan state media, citing witnesses, said a car bomb exploded near the Egyptian embassy in central Tripoli. The second blast occurred near the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in the western part of the capital, according to residents.

No injuries were reported in either blast, but photos posted to social media appeared to show extensive damage around both buildings.

A resident who lives near the UAE embassy said in a social media posting that the blast shattered some windows in nearby buildings.

The explosions come a day after bombings killed at least five and wounded more than a dozen in two eastern Libyan cities that are strongholds for Libya's anti-Islamist government.

Most embassies in Libya have closed due to the ongoing fighting there between Islamists and the internationally recognized government more than three years after rebels -- backed by NATO aircraft -- toppled the regime of Moammar Gadhafi.

In August, U.S. Pentagon and State Department officials said they believed Egypt and the UAE had been carrying out secret airstrikes against Islamist militants.

Egyptian officials have denied any involvement in Libyan airstrikes.
