(CNN) -- European leaders are under pressure from the U.S. to step up the EU sanctions against Russia, following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.

The U.S. announced expanded sanctions targeting two banks, two energy companies, Ukraine separatists and defense companies last week, before the plane, carrying 298 civilians including 80 children, was shot down above a rebel-controlled area in Ukraine.

EU leaders also said they intended to increase sanctions.

But in the past the EU has been reluctant to impose U.S.-style sanctions on key sectors of Russian economy. Many European countries rely on Russian energy and exports to the country.
