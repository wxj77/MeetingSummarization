New York (CNN) -- A crafty burglar tunneled through a hallway wall into a New York home and made off with valuable jewelry, watches and artwork by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.

The heist was worth between $500,000 and $1 million, said New York Police Department spokesman Sgt. John Buthorn.

The homeowners were away for the Thanksgiving weekend when the burglar broke into the apartment. Police did not identify the residents or the give the location of the apartment.

Among the items stolen was "Camouflage," a set of eight signed Warhol prints in various colors, the American artist's abstract take on a recognizable pattern.

Other stolen prints included "Thinking Nude" and "Moonscape," by Lichtenstein and

"The Truck" and "Superman" by Warhol. An oil painting called "Live Cat" by British artist Carl Fudge was also missing.

Police are asking the public for help in the search for the at-large suspect.
