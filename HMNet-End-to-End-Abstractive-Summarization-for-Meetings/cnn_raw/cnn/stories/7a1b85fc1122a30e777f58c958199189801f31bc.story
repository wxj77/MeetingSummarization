(CNN) -- A retired union president was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday and is accused of using his position to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The charges against Terence J. Bonner, former president of the National Border Patrol Union, include wire fraud, said United States Attorney Laura E. Duffy.

Bonner, who is from California, is accused of taking payments for union activities and using it for himself in a scheme to "defraud some 14,000 dues-paying union members," Duffy said.

"These false claims included periods of time when Bonner was actually visiting his mistress in Chicago or family members, as well as trips to attend non-Union activities, such as hockey games and other sporting events," the indictment says.

Bonner is also accused of filing for reimbursement for travel expenses for personal trips, Duffy said.

"Siphoning hundreds of thousands of dollars from hard-working fellow Border Patrol agents, many of whom put their lives on the line every day to protect this country, is a particularly troubling form of corruption that must be addressed," Duffy said.

Bonner was arrested and scheduled to be in court for his first appearance on Monday, August 20.
