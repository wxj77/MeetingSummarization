(CNN) -- Investigators involved in the case of serial killing suspect Elias Abuelazam went to Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday to retrieve two of his bags, Michigan police said.

Abuelazam is suspected of slashing 18 victims in Michigan, Virginia and Ohio, killing five. He was arrested at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, last week as he was attempting to board a flight to Israel.

Abuelazam has agreed to be sent back to Michigan to face charges, but he remains in custody in Atlanta.

Michigan authorities have some two weeks to pick him up. As of Monday afternoon, police said they do not know how, or when, Abuelazam will be transported.

He traveled last week from Detroit, Michigan, to Louisville, before heading to Atlanta, police said. The airline company misplaced his luggage and the bags never made it to Atlanta, they added.

Michigan authorities said they took the two bags back with them.

Lt. Steven Sipes of the Michigan police declined to say what was in the luggage, but he added the bags are now part of the department's investigation.
