(CNN) -- As fear about the spread of Ebola continues, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power says she'll be following standard health protocol following her return from Africa.

Power tweeted pictures of herself Friday morning being screened at the airport upon arrival in the U.S. The tweet also says that she'll be monitoring her health for 21 days, as per guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

She visited Ghana in an attempt to generate international support for fighting the virus.

"There is fear out there about what Ebola is and the people of Liberia have experienced this firsthand," Power said in a speech while there. "Fear and misunderstanding and incomplete understanding of the science impeded the early days of the response."

For those traveling overseas to areas of Africa where Ebola runs rampant, the CDC advises a self-monitoring period of 21 days and seeking medical care immediately if any of the symptoms -- like a strong fever, headache or vomiting -- are displayed. Power has said she will "obey the law and whatever requirements are in place."
