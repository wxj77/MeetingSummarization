(Mashable) -- Twitter has rolled out an update to its search tool that makes it easier to find new people to follow.

Now, when you search for a given topic on the microblogging site, you'll get suggestions of people and accounts that tweet about that topic.

For instance, a search for "movies" yields Roger Ebert, Judd Apatow, Jon Favreau and the iTunes Trailer account under the "People results for movies" sidebar.

You can get further suggestions by clicking on the "People" tab on the left-hand side search results where you can also browse recent tweets about the queried topic. In the movies example, further results include Tom Hanks, Disney-Pixar and Kevin Smith.

Previously, people results used a far simpler algorithm, showing people and accounts to follow based on keywords, the company said in a blog post.

Though a relatively small and obvious move, it's yet another addition to Twitter's web interface that makes third-party tools for performing the same task a little less relevant (though the service has also been offering personalized follow suggestions for some time).
