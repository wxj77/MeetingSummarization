(CNN)Two students were wounded in a shooting at a high school in Frederick, Maryland, on Wednesday.  The shooters are still at large, said police spokesman Capt. Richard Hetherington.

The shots were fired outside the gymnasium building, while a basketball game was being played inside, Frederick police said in a statement.

The victims were both male and were rushed to a medical facility in Baltimore, which lies about 50 miles east of Frederick. Their injuries were not life-threatening.

Frederick High School's cafeteria was searched, and the players and crowd went there from the gymnasium to wait while the rest of the building was being searched, the school said in a statement.

The investigation is ongoing.

"It is unclear, at this time, how many people were involved in the shooting and what the possible motive may have been," police said.

The school will be closed for students on Thursday, but teachers will report to work, the school said. Counselors will be available for students and staff to talk to.
