(CNN)We had no idea how much we would really, really, really, really like Tom Hanks lip-syncing to a Carly Rae Jepsen song, but we really do.

Hanks shows up in the new video for "I Really Like You," "singing" Jepsen's part throughout.

The Oscar-winning actor is apparently playing himself, signing autographs for fans, and generally being a very cheery movie star, before he and Jepsen take part in a flash mob.

So what exactly is Tom Hanks doing in this video in the first place?

Turns out he is good friends with Scooter Braun, manager for Jepsen (and Justin Bieber, who also appears in the video). He even sang and danced at Braun's wedding.

ABC reported that Hanks suggested himself to play the role, after Jepsen said it would be amusing for a man to lip-sync her song.

The result, as you can see, is kind of magical.
