(CNN) -- The railroad line involved in a deadly train derailment in New York earlier this month will be getting immediate safety improvements, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Sunday.

The Metro-North Railroad will be making safety reinforcements at critical curves and movable bridges along the railroad's right-of-way after Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed the MTA to do so, according to a news release.

Signal crews have already installed protections that will warn train engineers of the approaching speed reduction at the curve in the Bronx where the train derailed. The train's emergency brakes will be activated if speed is not lowered, according to the release.

Man vs. machine: Who should be at the wheel?

"Metro-North is taking important steps to improve safety for its customers and employees," MTA Chairman and CEO Thomas F. Prendergast said.

"I expect the railroad will continue searching for ways to improve its operations and fully restore its commuters' confidence."

The release also stated that all Metro-North trains will now have conductors next to engineers or communicating by radio at all critical curves and moveable bridges to verbally confirm train speeds, according to the release.

Agency issues emergency safety order after derailment

A Metro-North Hudson line train derailed December 1 in the Bronx, killing four people and injuring 67.

The train jumped the tracks while barreling into a curve at 82 mph, nearly three times the 30-mph limit for the curve, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

The engineer, William Rockefeller Jr., apparently "was nodding off and caught himself too late" before the accident, a union representative who met with the man has told CNN.
