(CNN) -- He's no Beyonce, but Michael Cera can still pull off a surprise album release.

The "Arrested Development" star released an 18-track album titled "True That" which features instrumental compositions and some vocals. Cera is no novice when it comes to music: He's sung backup vocals and played some on a Weezer track and jammed with the indie rock group Mister Heavenly.

The Daily Beast called it "a mix of instrumental tracks, lovely ballads and solemn covers" and compares (perhaps tongue-in-cheek) his project to Beyonce's surprise album.

The Daily Beast's Amy Zimmerman asks: "So is there any difference at all between Michael Cera's true that and BeyoncÃ©'s BeyoncÃ©?"

She answers her own question. "Honestly, not really. In 'What Gives,' Cera samples what appears to be a child's voice, which is a blatant attempt to rival Blue Ivy's vocal stylings on 'Blue.' 'Sexy Danger' has all the wild, sensual energy of 'Drunk in Love,' but with absolutely no words!"

His "Superbad" costar Jonah Hill tweeted his support of the project saying "My great friend Michael Cera not only is a brilliant actor, he also makes great music."

Cera's album is available for download on his site.
