(CNN) -- Mark Cavendish capped a superb week for Britain at the world cycling championships by winning the men's road race title Sunday with a trademark sprint finish.

Cavendish, the pre-race favorite on a course well-suited to his talents, timed his burst to perfection to take gold from Australia's Matthew Goss with Andre Greipel of Germany taking the bronze medal.

It was Britain's first men's road race title since the legendary Tom Simpson won in 1965 and took them to the top of the medals table at the championships in Copenhagen.

They claimed two gold, two silvers and two bronze medals as their dominance in track cycling extended to the various road disciplines.

Cavendish paid tribute to his teammates after they had paced him through the majority of the 260km race over 17 laps but with a tough uphill finish.

"There couldn't be any other result after the way the guys rode today," Cavendish told Eurosport.

"I'm so proud."

An early breakaway gained nearly 10 minutes, but with Britain forcing the pace at the front, it was pulled back and the decisive action took place on the last lap.

Tour de France hero Thomas Voeckler made a typical charge, but with time trial silver medalist Bradley Wiggins and the experienced David Millar to the fore, Britain were able to nullify his attempt.

In the uphill finish, it was the Australians who moved to the front, but Cavendish came through fast near the barriers and once he hit the front there was only one winner. Milan-San Remo winner Goss closed on the line while Greipel edged out Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara for the final podium spot.
