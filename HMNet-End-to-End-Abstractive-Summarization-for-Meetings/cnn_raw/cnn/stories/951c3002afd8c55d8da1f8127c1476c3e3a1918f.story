Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray, whose involuntary manslaughter trial starts next month, has hired a new lawyer for his legal team.

Los Angeles lawyer Nareg Gourjian will assist lawyers Ed Chernoff and J. Michael Flanagan in defending Murray, who is charged in pop star Michael Jackson's death.

A document filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Monday said Gourjian is replacing Joseph Low, who is leaving the Murray defense team.

Gourjian is a former of associate of Mark Geragos, a lawyer known for high-profile criminal cases. He helped Geragos with those cases, including Chris Brown's domestic violence charge and the trial of Scott Peterson, who was convicted of killing his wife.

Gourjian currently represents Joe Finley, an "America's Got Talent" prospect whose wife was found dead last fall at a Los Angeles hotel.

Murray is accused of killing Michael Jackson in June of 2009 with an overdose of the anesthetic propofol.

The defense lawyers and prosecution will meet for a hearing Tuesday to discuss discovery motions and other issues as they prepare for the start of jury selection on March 24.

Judge Michael Pastor ruled last week that the trial can be televised.
