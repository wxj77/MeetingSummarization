(CNN) -- Actor Martin Freeman is known for his memorable roles as Bilbo Baggins in the "The Hobbit" and Tim Canterbury in the BBC's "The Office."

Those universes collided when Freeman hosted this weekend's episode of "Saturday Night Live," bringing viewers to "The Office: Middle Earth."

What does life hold beyond the Shire for Baggins?

"What have I been up to? I went on a quest to save Middle Earth, I became a bit of a hero," he tells the camera in the documentary style of the long-running comedy series.

"Did the noble thing and turned down loads of treasure so that brave hobbit Bilbo Baggins now works at a paper company."

Evidence of both worlds imbues "The Office: Middle Earth." Gandalf is the obnoxious boss who subjects a staff of dwarves, elves and orcs to inappropriate jokes. Baggins flirts with elfish receptionist Tauriel, who helps him prank gullible deskmate and nemesis Gollum.

"You don't choose the people you work with," he tells the camera.

He also drives a Jetta, in case you were wondering. Watch the video below and see what else you missed.

Another highlight from Freeman's turn as host included a skit mocking the CIA torture report through the lens of Charlie Rose.
