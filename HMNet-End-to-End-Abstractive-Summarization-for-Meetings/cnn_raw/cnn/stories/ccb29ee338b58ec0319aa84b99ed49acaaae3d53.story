(CNN) -- Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay has been arrested on charges of operating a vehicle while intoxicated and possession of a controlled substance, police said.

He was arrested Sunday and is being held at the Hamilton County Jail in Indiana on $22,500 bond, said Lt. Joe Bickel of the Carmel, Indiana, Police Department.

A department news release says police stopped Irsay at 11:41 p.m. Sunday in Carmel for driving slowly, stopping in a roadway and failing to use his turn signal. He failed roadside field sobriety tests, and a search of his vehicle found prescription drugs in pill bottles, police said. The drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles in the vehicle, the release said.

CNN first learned about Irsay's arrest on Twitter.

NFL Senior Vice President of Communications Greg Aiello confirmed to CNN that the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all NFL personnel, making Irsay subject to disciplinary measures.

"We are gathering information at this time regarding last night's incident involving Jim Irsay," the Colts said in a prepared statement Monday. "The team will issue additional statements when the facts are sorted and we are aware of the next steps to this process. Many fans have reached out to express their concern and we appreciate their support."

Irsay would be the first NFL owner to face criminal charges since Eddie DeBartolo of the 49ers faced an indictment on federal racketeering charges in 1997.

In a tweet last December, the 54-year-old Colts owner said that he didn't drink: "(S)orry to ruin your theories ... but I don't drink ... at all," he posted on his official account.
