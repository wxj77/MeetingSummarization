(CNN)  -- Sergio Aguero scored twice on his Manchester City debut as Roberto Mancini's men thrashed Swansea 4-0 in their English Premier League opener Monday.

The Argentina international had just come on as a second half substitute when he struck the second for City.

Causing havoc in the Swansea defense, Aguero then cleverly set up David Silva for the third.

A thumping shot for the fourth rounded off a spectacular first match for Aguero and completed a miserable night for promoted Swansea.

Edin Dzeko opened the scoring for the home side just before the hour mark after a goalless first half.

The victory takes City joint top with Bolton in the early standings as they attempt to wrest the Premier League title from city rivals Manchester United.

Mancini was delighted by Aguero's performance, but warned he will improve.

"I think he needs to recover as he only finished the Copa America three weeks ago," he told Sky Sports.

"He needs another two to three weeks to be 100%, maybe. For me he`s a fantastic striker, young, and he`s going to be a fantastic player for us."

The result was a little harsh on Brendan Rogers'  Swansea, who played neat and containing football in the first half, but their goalkeeper Michel Vorm was kept busy and Gareth Barry was denied by the woodwork as the home side pressed.

In other English Premier League news Monday, Tottenham striker Robbie Keane is to join David Beckham at Los Angeles Galaxy on a two-year deal.

Keane, who is the the 10th-leading goal scorer in the history of the Premier League, has been capped 110 times by the Republic of Ireland.

He has fallen out of favor at Tottenham and spent the end of last season on loan at relegated West Ham.

"I am delighted, honored and very excited to be joining the LA Galaxy," Keane told their official web site.

"I have always wanted to come and play in MLS so it's the perfect combination for me and a dream come true."
