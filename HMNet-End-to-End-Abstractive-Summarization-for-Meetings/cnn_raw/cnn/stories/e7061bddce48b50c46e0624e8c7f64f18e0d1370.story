Los Angeles (CNN) -- Comedic actor Jeff Garlin's enthusiasm for a curbside spot led to an arrest in Studio City, California, over the weekend, police say.

Garlin -- a regular on HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and frequent guest star on "Arrested Development" -- allegedly "became upset" and smashed the windows of another motorist's car in a dispute over a parking space Saturday afternoon, according to Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman Lisa Forseberg.

Garlin, 51, was booked on a felony vandalism charge at the LAPD's Van Nuys jail, but later was released on $20,000 bail, according to jail records.

Calls and e-mails to the actor's representatives have not been returned.

CNN's Douglas Hyde contributed to this report.
