(CNN) -- All-star slugger Manny Ramirez has been arrested in southern Florida on one charge stemming from a domestic dispute, officials said Monday.

The former Boston Red Sox star was arrested at a residence on one charge of touch/strike battery, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

Ramirez, who hit 555 career home runs, announced his retirement from Major League Baseball in April, rather than continue with the league's drug prevention and treatment program.

He was suspended in 2009 for 50 games after violating the league's drug policy. Ramirez is 39.
