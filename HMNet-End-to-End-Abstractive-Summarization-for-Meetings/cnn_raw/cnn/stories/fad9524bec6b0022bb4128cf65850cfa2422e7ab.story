(CNN)  -- World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki has progressed to the last 16 at Indian Wells after beating Spain's Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez for the first time.

After losing to 29th-ranked Martinez Sanchez in their three previous encounters, the Dane needed just 71 minutes to close out a 6-1 6-3 win on Monday.

"She's a very different player; you don't get any rhythm against her," Wozniacki told the official WTA website. "It was very important to keep the pressure but not force it too much."

The 20-year-old's next opponent at the Californian hard-court tournament will be world No. 24 Alisa Kleybanova, who upset 15th-ranked Italian Flavia Pennetta 6-3 6-4.

Kleybanova's fellow Russian Maria Sharapova dropped her first service game against Aravane Rezai, but quickly regrouped to beat the French world No. 22 6-2 6-2.

"I started like I didn't have my cup of coffee or something, didn't have my peeps around, so that was disappointing," the three-time grand slam champion and world No. 18 said. "But I got it together."

The 23-year-old set up a fourth-round encounter with fellow former No. 1 and compatriot Dinara Safina.

Safina, who is on the comeback trail after slipping to 108th in the world rankings, knocked out fourth seed Sam Stosur of Australia 7-6 (7-2) 6-4.

Nadia Petrova became the fourth Russian woman to progress, after the world No. 18 battled past 18-year-old American wildcard Christina McHale 3-6 6-4 6-2.

Peng Shuai will be Petrova's next challenger, with the Chinese player earning a hard-fought 6-3 4-6 7-5 win over Czech qualifier Lucie Hradecka.

World No. 10 Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland also had to fight for her 6-0 2-6 7-5 win over Maria Kirilenko of Russia. She will now play eighth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, who defeated Agnieszka's younger sister Ursula 7-6 (7-3) 6-3.
