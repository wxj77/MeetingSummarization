(EW.com) -- Two weeks ago, EW premiered the trailer for Nickelodeon's reboot of the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" animated series, and now we've got some more exclusive information for you: The children's cable network will premiere the show on Saturday, Sept. 29 at 11 a.m. in a one-hour special event. Nickelodeon will officially announce the premiere date on the network on Saturday.

The half-hour action series is set to consist of 26 episodes about the four, butt-kicking turtles who rise from the sewers: Leonardo ("American Pie's" Jason Biggs), Raphael ("Lord of the Rings'" Sean Astin), Michelangelo ("Teen Titan's" Greg Cipes), and Donatello ("Planet Sheen's" Rob Paulsen, who voiced Raphael in the original animated series during the '80s and '90s).

The network describes the series as: "Funnier and with more Ninjutsu than ever before, the show will explore the companionship of four teenage brothers learning to rely on themselves and one another as they unravel the mystery of their existence and grow to become the heroes in a half-shell that they are destined to be."

Rounding out key roles in the series include Mae Whitman ("Parenthood") as the boys' pal April O'Neil; Hoon Lee ("Royal Pains") as the Turtles' sensei and father figure Master Splinter; and Kevin Michael Richardson ("Penguins of Madagascar") as nemesis Shredder.
