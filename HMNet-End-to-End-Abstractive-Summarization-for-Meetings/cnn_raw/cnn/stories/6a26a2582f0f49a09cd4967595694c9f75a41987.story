In our penultimate program of 2013, we report on the U.S. delegation to next year's Winter Olympics in Russia, and we examine a former basketball star's latest trip to North Korea. We also discuss some unusual behavior in the marine world, and we see how one company plans to train space tourists. Plus, we make a sweet Career Connection with a baker.
