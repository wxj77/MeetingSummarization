(CNN) -- Espanyol suffered a setback in their quest for European Champions League football on Monday as they surrendered a one-goal lead to lose 2-1 at home to Mallorca.

The Barcelona-based team currently occupy fifth position in Spain's La Liga and they took the lead against their tenth placed opponents when striker Alvaro Vasquez converted Jose Callejon's pass.

The match was level after 63 minutes when Cameroon forward Pierre Webo finished from a Sergio Tejera cross.

Michael Laudrup's Mallorca ensured they would move up to tenth place in the table when 23-year-old Emilio Nsue grabbed his fourth goal of the season with just seven minutes remaining.

The result means Mauricio Pochettino's Espanyol stay fifth, seven points behind Villarreal in the fourth and final Champions League place.

Sevilla closed within two points of Espanyol after a comfortable 3-0 home win over Sporting Gijon.

Goals from Luis Fabiano, Diego Perotti and Alvaro Negredo edged them into seventh, level on points with Athletic Bilbao.

In Germany, MSV Duisburg booked their place in the DFB Pokal Cup competition after beating Energie Cottbus 2-1 thanks to goals from Stefan Maierhofer and Srdjan Baljak.

Duisburg will face either Bayern Munich or Schalke in the final. They play on Wednesday.

In the French Cup, Nice booked their place in the semifinals with a 3-2 away win over second division outfit Stade de Reims.
