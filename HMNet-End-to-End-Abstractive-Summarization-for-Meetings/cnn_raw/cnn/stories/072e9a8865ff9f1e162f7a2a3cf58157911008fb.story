(CNN) -- A car and train collided Tuesday morning in Baltimore, leaving two people dead, police said.

The MARC commuter train with about 20 passengers crashed into a SUV with two people inside, Baltimore police Detective Jeremy Silbert said.

One occupant died on the scene; the other was transported to the hospital and died. No one was injured on the train, police said.

Authorities will look for surveillance videos as part of the investigation, Silbert said.

Maryland Transit Administration spokeswoman Paulette Austrich said the accident occurred when the car went around a lowered gate arm at a crossing and collided with a train that was traveling 50 mph. CNN affiliate WBFF quickly reported the crash on Twitter.
