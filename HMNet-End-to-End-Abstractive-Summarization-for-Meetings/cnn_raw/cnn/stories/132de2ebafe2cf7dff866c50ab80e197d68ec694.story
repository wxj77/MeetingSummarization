(Mashable)  -- The Samsung Continuum was announced earlier at the New York Stock Exchange, but the phone itself was just unveiled in Times Square.

It will take its place beside the Galaxy S and will, at least initially, be available exclusively on Verizon Wireless.

The device is similar to the Galaxy S in many ways. Its face is made from a 3.4-inch Super AMOLED touchscreen, making it perfect for media consumption. Additionally, the device is DLNA-compliant, so it can quickly connect with TVs and other devices with DLNA capabilities.

But the most distinguishing feature of this device isn't its main display; it's a secondary, 1.8-inch, Super AMOLED display.

The "ticker" display is used to display information ranging from incoming calls to status messages.

It's also touch capable and, when the primary screen is being actively used, incoming messages are routed to it, so the primary activity isn't interrupted.

The ticker can be activated separately from the main display using a unique grip sensor on the sides of the device. This allows users to discreetly look at relevant information without illuminating the considerably brighter main display.

Disappointingly, the Continuum will ship with Android 2.1, but Samsung has assured it will be updated rapidly. The question is whether Samsung will update to Android 2.2 or go straight to 2.3 (Gingerbread).

The Samsung Continuum will be available for pre-order on November 11.

It will be available in stores on November 18 -- one day before the Droid Pro -- for $200 after a $100 mail-in rebate.
