(CNN) -- Two more arrests were made in connection with the shooting death of a Mississippi State University student on campus, bringing the total number of suspects to three, officials said Tuesday.

All three suspects are from the Jackson, Mississippi, metro area, and they are believed to be acquaintances of the victim, who is from Madison, Mississippi, said university Police Chief Georgia Lindley.

All three suspects are facing a charge of capital murder with the intent to sell a controlled substance, Lindley said.

Trent Deundra Crump turned himself in to authorities of Alachua County Sheriff's Department in Gainesville, Florida, Lindley said.

Duntae Harvey, 21, was arrested Monday and was being transferred Tuesday from Rankin County, where he has been held, university officials said.

Mason Perry Jones, 21, of Jackson was arrested Monday in Memphis by members of the U.S. Marshal's Fugitive Task Force, Lindley said.

The victim, John Sanderson, 21, was found dead in Evans Hall, a dormitory for male students. The shooting took place place at 10 p.m. Saturday.

The suspects were apparently selling drugs and drugs were found at the scene of the shooting, Lindley told CNN affiliate WREG.

The shooting prompted the school to send a campus-wide alert through a series of text messages.

CNN's Joe Sutton and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.
