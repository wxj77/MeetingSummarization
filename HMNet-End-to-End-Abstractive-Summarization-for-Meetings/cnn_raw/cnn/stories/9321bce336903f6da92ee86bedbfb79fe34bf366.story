(CNN) -- Authorities in Virginia are searching for a young pregnant woman, missing since the end of January.

"Bethany Anne Decker, 21, was last seen on January 29, 2011, according to witnesses in the case, including family," a statement from the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office said.

She is believed to be about five months pregnant and is married to Emile Decker, a member of the U.S. Army National Guard, who is currently serving in Afghanistan. The couple also has a 17-month-old son.

"The family is concerned and so are we," said Vince DiBenedetto, a sheriff's spokesman. "We are in a race against the clock and playing catch-up on a lot of this."

She was last seen January 29 and was reported missing by her family about three weeks later on February 19 "after repeated attempts to make contact with her." Decker's last known address was in Ashburn, about 25 miles northwest of Washington, D.C.

Her car was found at an apartment complex where she lived and was in the process of moving from. DiBenedetto said the vehicle offered no clues to her whereabouts.

When her husband, Emile, was home on leave in January, the couple went to Hawaii to visit her father and then stayed with her grandparents in Maryland after they returned, DiBenedetto said.

Emile Decker returned to Afghanistan the first week of February and some members of her family saw him off at the airport. Bethany Decker was not there, according to DiBenedetto.

Authorities have talked with Emile Decker from Afghanistan via phone and are trying to arrange a video conference with him, DiBenedetto said.
