Octuplets mom Nadya Suleman settled the welfare fraud case against her by repaying $26,000 prosecutors say she illegally claimed.

Suleman, known in the media as "Octomom" because she gave birth to eight babies in one day, must also serve two years on probation and work 200 hours of community service under a plea deal announced Monday.

The Los Angeles district attorney accused Suleman, 39, of not reporting nearly $30,000 she earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress in the months after she applied for public assistance for her 14 children last year.

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge David Horwitz accepted Suleman's no contest plea to a single misdemeanor charge in court Monday after she proved she had paid the restitution to the state and county.

Suleman could have gotten up to six years and four months in prison if convicted of all four charges that had been pending, the prosecutor said.

Suleman told HLN's Dr. Drew in 2012 that her porn video was "the most empowering and liberating thing I've ever done."
