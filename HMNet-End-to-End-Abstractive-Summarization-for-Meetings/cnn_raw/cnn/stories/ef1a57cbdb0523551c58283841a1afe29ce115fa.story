(CNN) -- Two CNN journalists have been honored at the 2013 Business Travel Journalism Awards.

During the awards dinner at The Bloomsbury Ballroom in central London, CNN correspondent Ayesha Durgahee was named Business Travel News Journalist of the Year and CNN Business Traveller Senior producer Rosie Tomkins won Best Newcomer to Business Travel or Meetings & Events Journalism.

Durgahee won her second Business Travel Journalism Award for her CNN Business Traveller report on how the world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380, is built.

Ginny Buckley, journalist and chair of the judging panel, said: "We were all impressed with this evocative film that captured an iconic moment".

Tomkins won Best Newcomer for a report on the rise of in-flight wi-fi. The judges found the piece "well presented, well researched, and enjoyable to watch," said Buckley.

Deborah Rayner, Vice President and managing editor of CNN Europe, Middle East & Africa congratulated the pair: "Aviation and travel issues play an important part of our coverage, so to be recognised in this way is fantastic. Both members of the 'CNN Business Traveller' team always bring a fresh eye to business travel coverage, finding unique and compelling ways of telling stories."
