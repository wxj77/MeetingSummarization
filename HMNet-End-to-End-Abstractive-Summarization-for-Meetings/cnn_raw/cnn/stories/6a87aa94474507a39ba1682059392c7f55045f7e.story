(EW.com) -- "Law & Order: SVU" costar Stephanie March has just landed a key role in a CBS drama pilot.

March, who plays ADA Alexandra Cabot on the long-running NBC crime drama, has landed the part of Natalie in CBS' "Baby Big Shot." The project is a legal drama about a working-class woman (Janet Montgomery) who uses her street smarts to compete with her more polished colleagues at top New York law firms.

March's character is "Spence-educated Manhattan royalty," a high-ranking law firm associate who aspires to run the firm someday. Kyle MacLachlan also costars in the project.

March was an "SVU" series regular during seasons 2, 3, and 4 and went part-time in seasons 5, 6, 10, and 11, then returned this season in a semi-recurring role. If "Baby Big Shot" gets a series order, we're told she could still potentially make appearances on "SVU."
