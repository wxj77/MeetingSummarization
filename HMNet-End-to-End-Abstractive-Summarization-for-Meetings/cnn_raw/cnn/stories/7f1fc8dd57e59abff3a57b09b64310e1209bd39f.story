(CNN) -- Marc Marquez is a step closer to becoming the youngest rider to win the MotoGP title after snatching pole position for Sunday's final grand prix of the season in Valencia.

The 20-year-old posted a lap record time of one minute 30.237 seconds on Saturday to edge out title rival and reigning champion Jorge Lorenzo who was 0.340 seconds slower.

The Spaniard had a minor fright on the final qualifying lap when he nearly came off his bike, but was quick to see the positives of the incident.

"It was a little scare ahead of tomorrow to remind me I have to be 100% concentrated," Marquez told Spanish TV station Telecinco.

"The good thing is that I feel good, I have good rhythm on the bike and I just have to concentrate on my own race tomorrow."

The Spaniard needs only a fourth-place finish in Sunday's race to cap an incredible season and become the first rookie to win motorcycling's premier racing class since America's Kenny Roberts achieved the feat in 1978.

Italy's Valentino Rossi qualified fourth fastest on his Yamaha while Britain's Cal Crutchlow finished fifth with compatriot and Monster Yamaha Tech 3 teammate Bradley Smith completing the second row of the grid.
