(CNN) -- The Trans Alaska pipeline is expected to return to full service this week after a leak near Prudhoe Bay brought the flow of oil to a stop this month, a company spokeswoman said.

"We are in the final stages of the bypass line," said Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. spokeswoman Megan Egan.

The 800-mile line was shut down January 8 when a leak was found during an inspection of a pump house. The pipeline then was reopened from Tuesday through Saturday to flush remaining oil from the line.

When the pumping resumes, the flow will start at about 500,000 barrels of oil a day -- about three-quarters of normal flow -- and then move to its full capacity, Egan said.

The pipeline's daily average output is about 642,000 barrels, according to the company website.
