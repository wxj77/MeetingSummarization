(CNN) -- The death toll in the Bangladesh building collapse two weeks ago now stands at 823, an army spokesman said Wednesday, according to the state news agency.

Rescue workers managed to save more than 2,400 people in the aftermath of the April 24 collapse, but their work for the past week has focused on using heavy machinery to uncover the remaining bodies buried inside the ruins.

The news agency also reported that two volunteer rescuers have been killed during the rescue and salvage operation.

The building, which housed five factories full of garment workers, caved in, burying hundreds of people in a heap of mangled concrete in Savar, a suburb of the capital, Dhaka. It is the South Asian nation's deadliest industrial disaster.
