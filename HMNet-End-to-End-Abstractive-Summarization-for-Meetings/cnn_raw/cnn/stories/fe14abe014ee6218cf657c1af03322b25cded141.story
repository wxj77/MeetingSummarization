(CNN) -- Dozens of people died as heavy rain caused flooding and mudslides in Brazil this week, officials said Tuesday.

A mudslide early Monday in Sapucaia, Rio de Janeiro, killed at least 13 people, city officials said in a written release.

One person died in Laje do Muriae, Rio de Janeiro, city officials said.

In the neighboring state of Minas Gerais, at least people 15 died amid the rain as 116 cities have declared a state of emergency, the state-run Agencia Brasil reported.

Officials at the site of the mudslide in Sapucaia estimated Tuesday that at least nine people were still buried.

Seven cities in the metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area were under a state of emergency.

January is traditionally a month with heavy rain. A year ago, more than 800 people died because of floods in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
