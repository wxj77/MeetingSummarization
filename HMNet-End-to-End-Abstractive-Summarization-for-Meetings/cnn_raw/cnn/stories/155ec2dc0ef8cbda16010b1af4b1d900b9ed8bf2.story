(CNN) -- Fatma Nabil made history Sunday as she became the first veiled woman to read the news on Egyptian state television.

She wore an off-white hijab, or headscarf.

Veiled news anchors were not permitted to appear on state TV under the rule of Hosni Mubarak -- a longtime strongman forced from office last year.

The ban was lifted by Salah Abdel-Maqsoud, Egypt's information minister and a member of the long-suppressed Muslim Brotherhood.

"Finally! The revolution has reached Maspero," said Nabil, according to the information ministry. She was referring to the headquarters of the state TV and broadcast building, which was the site of massive demonstrations during the uprising that toppled Mubarak.

Nabil was a former anchor on a Muslim Brotherhood channel.

The ban on veiled anchors was issued in 2002 by the then-information minister, Safwat El-Sherif. He was arrested shortly after the Mubarak regime fell, and faces corruption charges.
