(CNN) -- A man has been arrested in connection with the shooting deaths of two Michigan women, including a mother who went missing shortly after her children left on the bus for school, authorities said.

Investigators found the bodies of Amy Henslee, 30, and Tonya Howarth, 36, Friday morning. They had been buried and appeared to have died after receiving multiple gunshot wounds, Van Buren County Prosecuting Attorney Juris Kaps told reporters.

Henslee's husband told police she was missing Monday, prompting a police investigation in Hartford Township, Michigan.

Authorities arrested an acquaintance of both women identified as Junior Lee Beebe, Kaps said. Beebe, 34, is also Henslee's husband's cousin, Kaps said.

Beebe faces murder charges in connection with both deaths, Kaps said.

Amy Henslee was last seen in Hartford Township at 7:30 a.m. Monday, about 10 minutes after her two children, ages 8 and 10, hopped on a bus for school. At 10 a.m., her husband telephoned -- as he does every weekday -- but didn't get a response, according to police.

After more unanswered calls, James Henslee left work for home to look for his wife. After finding the front door locked, he went in through an unopened back door and couldn't locate her.
