(CNN) -- Investigators are searching property that once belonged to one of five members of a Missouri family arrested on multiple child sexual abuse charges for "a body or bodies," the Lafayette County sheriff said Wednesday.

Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh said his department and other law enforcement agencies investigating the case are seeking witnesses and more possible victims.

"I believe that there is, and I believe every investigator here, after seeing the evidence, believes there's more victims," Alumbaugh said. "Pedophiles don't stop at one."

Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47, are being held in the Lafayette County Jail with bails ranging from $30,000 to $75,000.

Six children, who are siblings, came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects, and a forced abortion, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City.

The documents provide graphic details of the alleged abuse, provided by one of the children, whose names are being withheld. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said, adding that he expected additional charges based on other victim statements.

Alumbaugh said investigators were also searching several properties for glass jars that some of the victims may have buried containing notes detailing the alleged abuse.

The alleged abuse took place from the mid-1980s until 1995 and possibly beyond, the sheriff said. Additionally, he said, investigators are following other leads as well.

"There has been indications there are a body or bodies in various locations," Alumbaugh said.

Investigators have been working the case since August, he said, when the first of the now-grown children came forward.
