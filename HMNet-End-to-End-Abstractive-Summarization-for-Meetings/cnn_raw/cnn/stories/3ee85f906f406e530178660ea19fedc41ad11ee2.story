(The Hollywood Reporter)The skies over Gotham City might become bright once again in 2016, with Adam West and Burt Ward promising a return to their career-high roles of Batman and Robin as part of an upcoming animated project next year.

The comments took place at the Mad Monster Party in Charlotte, NC this weekend, with Ward somewhat uncertainly telling the crowd that they "can look forward to a new animated "Batman" full length, 90-minute feature, coming out on the 50th anniversary." (That would be the 50th anniversary of the 1960s Batman TV series, which launched Jan. 12, 1966.)

Why more 'Star Wars' actors haven't become stars

The animated movie is described by Ward as "one of possibly two, but for sure one, that Adam and I are going to be doing the voices for," although he didn't say anything else about the project. In fact, as video from the event shows below, he seemed unclear about whether he should talk about it at all, prefacing his comments with "I don't know... whether we can talk about the new Batman movie..." (Adam West declares they can, in a suitably Batman-esque authoritative tone.)

How Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman have changed their looks through the years

The profile of the 1960s Batman series has been raised considerably in recent years, with Warner Bros. Consumer Products and DC Entertainment releasing a line of merchandise and comic books based on the series under the brand Batman '66, leading up to last year's release of the full series on DVD and Blu-ray.

Batman through the years

Warner Bros. declined to comment about a potential 50th anniversary animated project when contacted by THR.
