(CNN) -- Seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher has laughed off rumors that he is planning to quit Formula One at the end of the season, confirming he is still totally committed to driving for Mercedes GP.

The 42-year-old German's future has come under scrutiny in recent weeks after a series of disappointing drives, with reports that Mercedes are planning to replace him for the 2012 campaign.

In 2010, Schumacher was overshadowed by younger team-mate Nico Rosberg, and although he has closed the gap this season, Rosberg continues to out-score his more illustrious team-mate.

However, in an interview with the official Mercedes website, Schumacher said: "Despite some funny rumours and stupid untruthful stories, I keep repeating myself that you will see me in 2012, whether you like it or don't like it."

Schumacher added: "The good thing is that I have a lot of support from all around me.

"I have support from the company and the team -- they all want me to be here and I want to be here, so I am looking forward to next season."

Schumacher's Mercedes car has struggled to keep pace with the Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari cars this season.

His best result came in June's Canadian Grand Prix, when he turned back the clock to finish in an impressive fourth place.
