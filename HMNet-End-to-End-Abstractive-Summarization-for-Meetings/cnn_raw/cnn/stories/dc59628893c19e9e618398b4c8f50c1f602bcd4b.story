(CNN) -- A doctor at a Pennsylvania weight-loss clinic is scheduled for a preliminary hearing next week on charges that he sexually assaulted at least six female patients, according to the criminal complaint from the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, district attorney's office.

Dr. Arie Oren, 64, is charged with multiple counts of aggravated  indecent assault and indecent assault that allegedly occurred during  patient visits at the Conshohocken Weight Control clinic between the  spring of 2008 through November 2010, the complaint said. Conshohocken is  a suburb of Philadelphia.

Oren was formally charged earlier this week, with allegations in the district attorney's criminal complaint including that he told several patients that an orgasm would help them burn calories.

The six female victims listed in the affidavit, who range in age from 24 to 59, described similar experiences with Oren at the clinic.  The victims told prosecutors they were all touched inappropriately or groped and he allegedly penetrated most of the victims' genitals with an electronic massager as an excuse to "break up the fat."

One victim recounted that after Oren used the massager and touched her below the waist, he said, "You know, if you have an orgasm you will burn 200 calories," according to the document.

Another victim claimed that Oren tried to kiss her after assaulting her and said that the visit was free because she was "so hot," the complaint said.

Oren has a valid medical license that expires in December 2012, according to Pennsylvania's Department of State website.

Efforts by CNN to reach Oren on Tuesday evening were not successful and a person who answered the phone at the Conshohocken Weight Control clinic said personnel there were not commenting on the case. Efforts to reach an attorney reported to be representing Oren also were unsuccessful.

Oren is free on bail pending a preliminary hearing scheduled for April 21, according to Assistant District Attorney Kate McGill.
