(CNN) -- Ooh, looks like things are heating up between Snoop Dogg and Iggy Azalea -- and not in a good way.

For yet another day, the two rappers went at it on social media, with Snoop baiting her, Iggy responding and Snoop egging her on.

The back-and-forth started Sunday night when Snoop posted a meme and titled it "Iggy Azalea No Make Up."

The Instagram insult generated 11,000 comments and 50,000 likes.

So Iggy posted some not-so-fancy tweets in response.

They've since been deleted. But hey, this is the Internet -- and nothing is truly gone.

"Everytime I've ever spoken to you you've always been nice as hell, I'm disappointed you'd be such an ass for no reason," one said.

"Why would you post such a mean pic on insta when you send your body guards to ask me for pictures every time we are at shows."

That was Monday.

Cue Tuesday, when Snoop was back with more -- some decidedly mean ones.

He called her the b-word in one, asking her to "cool out" because he was only kidding.

In another Instagram post, he cranked it up a notch, threatening her.

And, just to rub it in, he posted a side-by-side of Iggy and Marlon Wayans' in-drag character from "White Chicks."

Iggy fired back.

"If I'm a (b-word) for asking why you are supportive to my face but another way on your Instagram then so be it," one tweet said.

"Post away about this '(b-word)' I've seen all the memes the world has to offer in regards to me i honestly don't care," another said.

Snoop responded with more expletives. Iggy followed with some retweets from supportive fans.

She then posted: "Ima be the bigger man in this situation and leave it be."

Here's our fervent hope that both of them do.
