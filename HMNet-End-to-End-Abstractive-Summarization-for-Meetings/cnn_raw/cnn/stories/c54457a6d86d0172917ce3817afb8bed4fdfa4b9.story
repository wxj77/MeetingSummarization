(CNN)Are you a female artist or designer?

If so, CNN International is looking for your help with a voluntary project for International Women's Day on March 8.

We asked our audience, our journalists and our partners around the world to select the quotes by women that inspire them.

We've been inundated with quotes -- and now we need your help to bring them to life by creating beautiful illustrations.

If you would like to help promote the inspiring words of women and have your work seen by CNN's global audience, please email leading.women@cnn.com by Wednesday, February 4.

We'll send you a quote and all the information you will need to produce your illustration. Your work could appear in a gallery on CNN.com and on a CNN International Women's Day Pinterest board.
