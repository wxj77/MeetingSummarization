Baghdad (CNN) -- Dozens have died in Iraq in explosions primarily targeting amusement parks where families and children typically go to celebrate the Islamic holiday of Eid Al-Adha, according to police.

At least 34 people died and 122 were wounded Monday in the series of car-bomb and roadside explosions across Baghdad, police officials said. At least 10 car bombs and three roadside bombs exploded in several Baghdad neighborhoods

In the northern town of Muwafakiya, a car bomb killed 17 people and wounded at least 66 in a refugee compound, police said.

The explosion caused buildings to collapse, trapping victims under rubble. The town is 20 miles east of Mosul.

Seven children were among the dead, police said.

The compound was home to displaced members of an ethnic Shiite minority and is near a Shiite mosque. Sunni extremist groups such al Qaeda have been targeting the minority in Nineveh province in recent months, police said.

Iraq has seen a sharp increase in tension between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government.
