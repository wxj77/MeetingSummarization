(CNN) -- The editor in chief of a newspaper in Benghazi, Libya, was shot and killed Monday morning, the latest in a recent campaign of killings across the city.

Muftah Buzeid was also a prominent analyst who frequently appeared on TV talk shows speaking out against Islamist extremism. His last such appearance was Sunday night.

Many Libyans are outraged over the killing, which is likely to add to the support for renegade Gen. Khalifa Haftar and his campaign against terrorism.

The deaths have mainly targeted security forces but also activists, journalists and judges.

The city has been almost emptied of Westerners as diplomatic missions shut after the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate that killed American Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

Officials and many residents blame the violence on Islamist extremist groups that have grown in size and influence since the 2011 revolution that overthrew longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

A weak central government has not been able to secure Benghazi or bring the perpetrators of the near-daily attacks to justice.

Ten days ago, Haftar launched a surprise ground and air assault on Islamist militia positions and bases in Benghazi, including attacks on Ansar al-Sharia, the group blamed in the U.S. Consulate attack.
