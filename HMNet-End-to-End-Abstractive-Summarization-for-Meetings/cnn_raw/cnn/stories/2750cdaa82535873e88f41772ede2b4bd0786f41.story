(CNN) -- "MythBusters" is looking to the future -- and leaving some of its regulars behind.

On Thursday night's episode of the Discovery Channel show, longtime hosts Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage announced that the members of the Build Team, also known as M7 -- Grant Imahara, Kari Byron and Tory Belleci -- were leaving the show.

Moreover, as Byron revealed in a tweet afterwards, the show was "taking a new direction."

Byron and Belleci had been with "MythBusters" since 2004. Imahara joined in 2005.

"It is ... the end of an era," Savage said in a video message.

"This next season we're going back to our origins with just Adam and me," said Hyneman.

"It has been a total pleasure, not only to work with you, but to call you our friends," said Savage.

The trio thanked the show for the experience.

"It's been an amazing ride for 10 years! We couldn't have done it without you guys. You're the best fans anyone could wish for. Thank you," tweeted Belleci.

"I am sad for an ending but there will be exciting new adventures for us," tweeted Byron.

No reason was given for the change. In a statement, Discovery Channel said, "Everyone at Discovery wants to thank them for their tireless work busting almost 1000 myths, and we wish them all the best on their future endeavors."

The show has been on the air since 2003.
