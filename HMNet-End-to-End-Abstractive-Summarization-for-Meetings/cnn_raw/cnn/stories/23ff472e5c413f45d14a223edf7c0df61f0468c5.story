(CNN) -- A pair of suspected U.S. drone strikes on militant targets in Pakistan killed at least seven people, Pakistani intelligence sources said Friday.

The strikes were carried out in North Waziristan, a mountainous region near the border with Afghanistan that's rife with militant activity.

One strike targeted a militant hideout in the Kund area of Shawal, killing four, the intelligence sources say. The second struck at Uzbek hideouts in the Mangroti area, killing three, according to the sources.

A similar strike Saturday in North Waziristan's Datakhel region killed five militants, intelligence sources told CNN at the time.

The strikes come amid an offensive by Pakistan's army in North Waziristan aimed at clearing out Taliban and other militants in the region. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced.
