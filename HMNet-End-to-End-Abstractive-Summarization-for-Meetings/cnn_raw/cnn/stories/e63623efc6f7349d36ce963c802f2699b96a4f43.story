(CNN) -- The Duchess of Cambridge's style has long been a topic of conversation. (Remember that see-through dress she wore during a 2002 charity fashion show at the University of St. Andrews?) But British Vogue is taking the world's fascination with Catherine's closet a step further.

In its February issue, the magazine details everything from the average diameter of Kate's curls (25 millimeters) to the average number of teeth she exposes while smiling (8.6).

We already know she fancies labels such as Alexander McQueen and Jenny Packham, but now we can say, with certainty, that she dons blue more than any other color, and she wears boat necks to 42% of the engagements she attends.

And while her style choices can influence sales -- a phenomenon dubbed the Kate Effect -- designers such as Roland Mouret say it's not so cut and dried.

"The kind of people who like Kate's style are not the kind to rush out and copy her dress," Mouret told British Vogue. "You don't see hundreds of women running around looking like her. To be honest, we're more likely to get orders on a dress that Kim Kardashian's worn."
