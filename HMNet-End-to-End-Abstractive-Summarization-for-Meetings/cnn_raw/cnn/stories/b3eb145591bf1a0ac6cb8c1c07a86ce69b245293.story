(CNN)  -- The MotoGP race due to be held in Japan next month has been postponed until later in the year in the aftermath of Friday's earthquake and tsunami.

The 9.0-magnitude quake caused cracks on the track and damaged spectator seats at the circuit in Motegi, to the north of Tokyo.

In a statement on their official website, the sport's governing body confirmed that the motorbike world championship race would now take place in October.

It is the latest in a list of sporting fixtures to be affected by the recent disaster in the Asian country, where there are also fears of a radiation leak from several explosions at a nuclear plant.

On Monday it was confirmed that the World Skating Championships, scheduled to take place in Tokyo this month, had been postponed until further notice.

The Japanese Football Association, meanwhile, said that no J-League football matches would take place in March, and added that the national team's upcoming friendly games could also be abandoned.

Japan is continuing to experience aftershocks from the quake which has already claimed the lives of thousands of people and left many more homeless.

The 18-race MotoGP season will now begin in Losail, Qatar on March 20.

It is the second year in a row that the Japanese round has had to be rescheduled.

The 2010 race was also postponed from April to October following the volcanic ash crisis in Iceland that prevented competitors and spectators from flying to the Far East.

The opening race in the 2011 Formula One championship has already had to be cancelled this year.

The season-opener in Bahrain was called-off amid ongoing political unrest and protests in the country, and the first grand prix will now take place in Melbourne on March 26.
