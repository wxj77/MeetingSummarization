(CNN) -- Juan Martin Del Potro is confident he can return to his best form in a month after crashing to a 6-3 6-0 defeat against Spain's Feliciano Lopez in the first round of the Japan Open.

Del Potro is still working his way back to full fitness after an eight-month absence with a wrist injury, and world number six Lopez took just 82 minutes to dispose of the Argentinean.

Speaking to the ATP World Tour website, the 22-year-old said: "It is difficult to come back and play against these players, especially Feliciano on such a fast court.

"I need time, I need to work on a few things to get back to my best level. If I work in a good way, I will be in good shape in a month or so."

Elsewhere in the draw, Russia's Dmitri Tursunov earned an impressive win over seventh-seed Ernests Gulbis, defeating the Latvian in straight sets 6-3 6-4.

Tursunov did not suffer one break of serve in the match, completing his victory in a swift 72 minutes.

On the women's tour, Jelena Jankovic suffered a shock defeat at the China Open, going down 6-2 2-6 6-2 against fellow Serb Bojana Jovanovski.

It was a disappointing result for the third seed, who exited in the second round alongside Agnieszka Radwanska.

Radwanska lost 5-7 7-6 7-5 in a hard-fought match against Angelique Kerber of Germany.
