Paris (CNN) -- One of Paris' most upscale districts was once again the site of an armed jewelry store robbery Thursday, police said.

Police said a number of luxury watches were stolen in a midday heist near Place Vendome, just blocks from the presidential palace and other important buildings.

A couple, each armed with a handgun, entered the store and managed to escape with several luxury watches, police said.

Police declined to give an estimate for the value of the stolen goods, but CNN affiliate BFMTV reported that they were worth 800,000 euros (about U.S. $1.1 million).

No one was hurt during the robbery, police said.

It is not the first large heist in the high-end neighborhood this year.

In September, burglars stole more than 1 million euros worth of jewelry from another store.
