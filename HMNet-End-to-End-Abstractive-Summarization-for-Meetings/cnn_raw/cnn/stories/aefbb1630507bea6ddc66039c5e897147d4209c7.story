(CNN) -- It seemed too good to be true. Andy Kaufman still alive.

The Internet erupted with the buzz after Kaufman's brother read a letter purportedly from Andy at a comedy club on Monday night and introduced a 24-year-old woman as his brother's daughter.

But almost as quickly as reports surfaced Thursday, the news seemed to fizzle, with Michael Kaufman telling CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper" that he believes he's the victim of a hoax.

"Now that it's Thursday, not Monday anymore, I believe I am part of a hoax," Kaufman said in a bizarre, rambling interview where he spoke in a monotone not unlike his brother.

"I don't believe she's acting on her own, though," Kaufman said of the woman he introduced Monday night. "But, you know, that's all I know."
