Fine wine, fashion, long lunches and secular laws -- the answer to what France is all about depends on who you ask.

As part of CNN's special iList coverage of France, anchor Hala Gorani is hosting a panel on national identity in Paris as part of iList, CNN's series looking at France.

Hala will speak to some of the country's leading minds about the future of France, the strength of French business, what makes the country competitive and which way its culture is headed.

The high-profile panelists include Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, CEO of Air France and KLM, Dominique Senequier, CEO of AXA Private Equity, Claudie Haignere, a former astronaut and former Minister for European Affairs, and Ahmed el Kheiy, a journalist and TV presenter.

Watch the panel discuss these issues on Saturday 20 February: 1930 GMT| 2030 CET|1430 ET

The guests tackle the topics of diversity, tolerance and the role France should play in Europe.

Some believe that France weathered the financial crisis better than any of its Continental neighbors, while others said that inefficient tax laws and rigidity in labor markets were holding the world's fifth largest economy back.

Has President Sarkozy put the country on a better track? Are France's socialist roots being dug up? Are the French ready to elect their own Obama?

And what about cheese, bread and art? Can France culturally maintain its pre-eminence?
