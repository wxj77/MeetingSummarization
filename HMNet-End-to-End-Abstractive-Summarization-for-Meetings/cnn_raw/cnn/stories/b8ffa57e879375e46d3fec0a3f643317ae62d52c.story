(CNN) -- A total of 46 inmates were injured during a prison riot at the North Fork Correctional Facility in western Oklahoma, but there were no fatalities, prison officials said Wednesday.

Multiple fights had broken out in the 2,500-bed facility on Tuesday, but order was restored and the facility was completely locked down, according to a statement by Corrections Corporation of America, which runs the prison.

As of Wednesday there were no reports of staff injuries, CCA said.

Regarding the injuries, 16 inmates were transported to facilities outside the prison for treatment, including one who has already returned to the facility. Another 30 inmates were treated on-site by medical staff, CCA said.

While the riot was taking place, a morgue was set up in a tent outside the prison, though there were no fatalities.

Aerial video of the scene from CNN affiliate KOCO showed armed officials holding prisoners at gunpoint.

The prison is located in Sayre, about halfway between Oklahoma City and Amarillo, Texas.
