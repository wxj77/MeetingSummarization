(CNN) -- Maicon and Samuel Eto'o were both on target in the second half to give champions Inter Milan a 2-0 win over 10-man Juventus, a result that sees Jose Mourinho's side return to the top of the Serie A table.

The win, only Inter's fourth in 12 league matches, sends them back to the top of the table by two points from Roma -- who can reclaim top spot if they beat Lazio in the Rome derby on Sunday.

A cagey first-half exploded into life eight minutes before the interval when Juve midfielder Mo Sissoko received a second yellow card for a late challenge on Javier Zanetti.

The 10-men bravely held out until the 75th minute when Inter took a stunning lead through defender Miacon.

The Brazilian juggled the ball over Amauri on the edge of the area before firing a superb strike past goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon.

Mario Balotelli then struck the crossbar with a free-kick before the points were sealed in the final minute when Samuel Eto'o was left unmarked in the area to slide home a Sulley Muntari cross.
