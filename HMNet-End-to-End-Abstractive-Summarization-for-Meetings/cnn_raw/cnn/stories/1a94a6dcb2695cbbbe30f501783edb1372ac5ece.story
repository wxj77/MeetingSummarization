(CNN) -- The bodies of four children swept away in a creek swollen by storm waters in western Kentucky were recovered Friday morning, local authorities said.

The first body was recovered shortly after midnight; two others were located about 30 minutes later, said Graves County Sheriff Dewayne Redmon. Missouri officials assisting in the search later found the fourth body.

The children were traveling with their Amish family in a horse-drawn carriage on a flooded street in Graves County when the carriage flipped over Thursday evening, said Jerry Beasley, a Kentucky State Police spokesman.

In all, there were six children and their mother in the carriage, Beasley said

The mother and two children were able to get to a safe area. But the other four children were swept away with the carriage into a nearby creek.
