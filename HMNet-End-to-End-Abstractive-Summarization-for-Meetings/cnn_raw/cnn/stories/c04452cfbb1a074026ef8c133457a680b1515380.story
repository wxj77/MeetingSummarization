London (CNN) -- As we prepare to embrace a new year, women have been sharing their plans to improve their work lives in 2013.

We asked women to tell us their career New Year's resolutions, and you have inspired us with your ideas.

Whether they're big ambitions, a change in attitude or new priorities, the women who contributed know what they want and how to get it.

Here are some of our favorite pieces of advice -- we hope you find them helpful too:

Create time for things that are important

Whether it's creating time for business priorities or life outside work, many wanted to work more efficiently.

Amanda Pouchot, founder of The Levo League, an online community of young professional women, said: "My goal is to be better at prioritizing so that I can leave the office at a reasonable hour and go to the gym. In order to succeed in my job, I need to first take care of myself and be the best I can be."

On The Levo League discussion board Kristen Andersson said: "In 2013, I'll shift my career into next gear by deliberately setting aside time for the two long-term projects I've identified."

Louisa Crook added on Twitter: "Going to push forward once and for all with focusing on my niche (content) and stop taking clients that keep me out of it!"

Ask for more

Erica, on the CNN comments thread, said: "Confidence. Even when I'm not feeling particularly confident, forcing myself to act confident.

"I think it's important women not be afraid to go after what they want professionally -- which means being direct and asking for that next raise or promotion. This coming year, I will be focusing on squashing that fear. I'd rather get a hundred 'nos' than never have asked in the first place."

Also on the CNN comments, cap said: "This year I'm working on being more assertive with my opinions and ideas. Working on my leadership skills and putting myself out there and once I am able to do that, ask for a promotion and pay raise."

On Levo League, Kat Reilly said: "My number one goal for 2013 is to ask for more -- to let others know what I want, to go after it and to take action."

Improve my relationships

Dr Letitia Wright, host of the Wright Place TV Show, in Southern California, got in touch on Twitter to say: "I plan to leverage my relationships (better) in 2013. Connect on (a) deeper level and make things happen for both parties."
