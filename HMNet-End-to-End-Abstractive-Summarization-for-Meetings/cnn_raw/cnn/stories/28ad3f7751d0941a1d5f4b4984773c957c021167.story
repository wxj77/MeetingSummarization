(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Real Madrid closed the gap on Barcelona to seven points at the top of La Liga with a 4-1 home win over Real Sociedad on Sunday.

Defending champions Barca went 10 points clear on Saturday night after their record breaking 16th consecutive victory -- Lionel Messi's hat-trick defeating Atletico Madrid 3-0 and ensuring Pep Guardiola's side overtook the winning run set by the great Real Madrid side in the 1960-61 season.

But Real looked determined to close the gap and took a seventh minute lead when Kaka slotted the ball home after a poor clearance from Gorka Elustondo.

Ronaldo had come under some criticism after going four matches without a goal, but he ended that streak with a first-half double.

First the Portuguese international turned a defender on the edge of the area before firing home and he then headed in a corner for his 25th goal of the season, overtaking Messi at the top of the scoring charts in the process.

The visitors pulled a goal back when Raul Tamudo's shot was blocked by goalkeeper Iker Casillas -- but the rebound cannoned off Alvaro Arbeloa into the net.

However, Real Madrid finished the job when Emmanuel Adebayor netted his first league goal for the club following his loan move from Manchester City.

Meanwhile, Valencia maintained their recent impressive run of form with a 2-0 success over Hercules, to move to within a point of third-placed Villarreal.

Goals from Aritz Aduriz and a Tino Costa free-kick gave Valencia their sixth win in seven games and closed the gap on Villarreal, who suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at home to lowly Levante on Sunday.

Elsewhere, Sevilla are now six points off a Europa League place after being held to a 0-0 draw by bottom side Malaga in the Andalusian derby.
