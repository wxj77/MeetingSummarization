Washington (CNN) -- An underground transformer fire about two blocks from the White House prompted evacuations of two Washington hotels, fire officials said Saturday night.

Flames shot up through a sidewalk on F Street NW between 14th and 15th streets after 8 p.m., said Pete Piringer, a spokesman for the District of Columbia Fire Department.

The historic Willard Intercontinental Hotel and the W Hotel were evacuated and a couple of blocks were without power, Piringer said.

The fire was largely contained, he said, and no injuries have been reported.
