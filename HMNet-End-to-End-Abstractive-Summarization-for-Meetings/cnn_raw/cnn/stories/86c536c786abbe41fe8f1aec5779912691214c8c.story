(CNN) -- In 1960, an unprecedented number of African nations won independence from their colonial masters, bringing to an end decades of rule by European powers.

This year those 17 nations mark a major milestone as they celebrate the 50th anniversary of their freedom.

As part of CNN's special coverage of this landmark occasion, we asked Africans from these countries to share their thoughts and opinions about their homelands.

After a half-century of independence, what has changed and what hasn't? What are their hopes and visions for the future?

From those who lived through the handover of power, to young Africans who have only known life in a free state, click on the flags to see what some of them had to say.
