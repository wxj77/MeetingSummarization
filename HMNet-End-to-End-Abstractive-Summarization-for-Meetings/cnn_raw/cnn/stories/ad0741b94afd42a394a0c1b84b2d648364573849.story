(CNN)  -- Mark Wilson claimed his second PGA Tour win of the season as he beat fellow American Jason Dufner at the second extra hole of a playoff to win the Phoenix Open Monday.

Wilson drained an 10-foot birdie putt to edge out Dufner after both had finished tied on 18-under 266 in regulation play, the tournament held over after frost delayed proceedings Sunday.

Wilson, who took the season-opening Sony Open is riding the crest of the wave with his fourth career PGA Tour win.

"This is the best golf I've every played in my life, I don't get down on myself and I've a good attitude right now," he told the Golf Channel.

Wilson closed with a two-under 69 while Dufner went into the playoff after a fine 66 with birdies at the 16th and 18th as he chased his first Tour win.

His victory completed a dream weekend for Wilson, who is a big fan of Super Bowl winners, the Green Bay Packers.

"I was a little more nervous today than I was expecting," he told the official PGA Tour website.

"I didn't sleep great last night. It was probably the excitement with the Super Bowl and the uncertainty of today."

His victory secured his spot in the Masters as he jumps from 91st to 51st in the world rankings.

Scotland's Martin Laird (65) and veteran Vijay Singh of Fiji (66) tied for third at 16-under 268.

Home hope Tommy Gainey, who led by one shot after 54 holes, was in the mix down the stretch, but found the water twice at the par-four 17th on his way to a triple bogey.
