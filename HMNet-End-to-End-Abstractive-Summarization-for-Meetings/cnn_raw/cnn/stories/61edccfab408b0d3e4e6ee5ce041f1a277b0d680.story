Famed hip-hop rapper Jay Jenkins, known as "Young Jeezy," was arrested on Sunday in relation to a deadly shooting at a Wiz Khalifa concert, police said.

"Six people, including Jenkins, were arrested at Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre in Irvine, California, on Sunday for possession of an assault rifle," said Lt. Saul Jaeger of the Mountain View Police Department.

Law enforcement continues to pursue an active investigation, though no arrests have been made in Friday's homicide, Jaeger said. All six people were "cooperative" in the related arrest on Sunday,  Jaeger said.

Bail is set at $1 million for Jenkins, who is being held at the Orange County Police Department close to where the arrest occurred,  said Lt. Jeff Hallock of the Orange County Sheriff's Department.

Authorities first got calls about gunshots at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Northern California, shortly after 11 p.m. Friday, the Mountain View Police Department said.  Police arrived to find a 38-year-old man shot multiple times. The man was transported to a hospital and died from his injuries, according to police.

Mountain View investigators found the weapon on a tour bus after a search warrant had been authorized.

In the wake of the shooting, Wiz Khalifa canceled his concert on Saturday in Chula Vista, California.
