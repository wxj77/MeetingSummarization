(CNN) -- Good news for Ed Sullivan fans: Los Angeles police have found the missing bronze statue of the renowned American TV personality, four days after it was stolen from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.

Los Angeles police found the 20 pound, 18 inch statue on Thursday and said it is in good condition. No further details on the case were released by police.

The statute was on display in an outdoor exhibit, along with statues of several other classic television personalities and television pioneers, at the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame Plaza. It was taken from atop a pedestal on Sunday, police said.

The North Hollywood Area burglary detectives division of the Los Angeles Police Department are asking the public for any information that would lead to the arrest of the suspect or suspects responsible for the theft.
