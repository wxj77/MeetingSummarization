(CNN)Talks between the United States and Iran on the Tehran's nuclear program will resume in Geneva on Friday, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said.

A final outcome to what has been monthslong series of negotiations is expected to have a lasting effect on Iran's relations with the West.

Speaking to Iran's IRNA news agency, Araqchi said the talks will be at the deputy ministerial level, followed by a meeting of the two countries' foreign ministers.

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zari and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are scheduled to join the talks in Geneva on Sunday and Monday, Araqchi said.

There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S. side.

"At the end of the four days of bilateral talks between Iranian and US nuclear delegations, discussions will possibly continue with participation of all members of the Group 5+1," Araqchi said.

Better known as the P5+1, that group consists of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom and France. The plus one is Germany.

A comprehensive agreement could bring about an end to significant sanctions against Tehran and a warming of relations with the West. The absence of a deal would most likely ramp up tensions and could lead to more punitive measures -- and even confrontation -- over Iran's controversial nuclear program.

Iran insists that like other countries, it has a right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. But Western powers have accused it of trying to develop not just nuclear energy but nuclear weapons as well.
