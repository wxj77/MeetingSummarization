(CNN) -- Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola has signed a one-year contract extension with the Spanish champions.

Guardiola took over at Barcelona in 2008 after coaching their B team and already has seven titles to his name. The new deal will take him through to June 2011.

In his first year in charge he led his team, including Argentina striker Lionel Messi and Spanish pair Xavi and Andres Iniesta, to the Spanish league and cup double, as well as a European Champions League triumph.

Guardiola added the World Club Cup, the Spanish Super Cup and the European Super Cup to his impressive haul the following year, as well as retaining the Spanish League with a record breaking 99 points.

Barcelona failed to retain their Champions League title in 2010 after they were beaten in the semifinal by Italian champions Inter Milan, who were then coached by Jose Mourinho.

Mourinho has now taken over as coach of Barcelona's rivals Real Madrid and will be aiming to take Guardiola's title next season.

Barcelona provided seven of the starting 11 players that secured Spain's first ever World Cup win as they beat Netherlands 1-0 in South Africa.

Guardiola gave his word to previous club president Joan Laporta that he would extend his contract back in January, and he signed the deal with new president Sandro Rosell at Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium on Wednesday.
