(CNN) -- Cheick Diabate scored twice as Mali defeated 10-man Ghana 2-0 to finish third in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations on Saturday.

The Bordeaux striker opened the scoring in the 23rd minute stabbing home a rebound after Ghana keeper Adam Larsen failed to hold onto Bakaye Traore's low shot.

Ghana offered little in reply during the remainder of the first period with only a Jordan Ayew shot forcing a save from Oumar Sissoko.

The Black Stars did manage to get the ball in the back of the net when Sulley Muntari fired home but he was ruled offside.

Their chances of getting back on level terms were dealt a blow in the 64th minute when Issac Vorsah was given his second yellow card of the game for kicking out at Samba Diakite.

Mali made sure of third place 10 minutes from time when Cheick Diabate scored his second to ensure The Eagles' best result in the competition since 1972 when they were beaten finalists.
