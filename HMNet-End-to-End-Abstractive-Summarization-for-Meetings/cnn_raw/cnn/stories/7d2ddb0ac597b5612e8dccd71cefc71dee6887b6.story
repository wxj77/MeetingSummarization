(CNN) -- The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Samantha Power as the next ambassador to the United Nations.

The confirmation, by a 87-10 vote, was lauded by President Barack Obama.

"As one of our country's leading foreign policy thinkers, Samantha knows that our nation's interests are advanced with strong and principled American leadership," Obama said in a statement.

Power worked for Obama's campaign in 2008 until she resigned after referring to Hillary Clinton -- the other leading Democratic contender at the time -- as a "monster."

Prior to the confirmation, Power was senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights at the National Security Council and a former special assistant to the president.

Power also has written extensively on preventing genocide, with criticism of the United Nations for failing to stop attacks in Bosnia and Rwanda.
