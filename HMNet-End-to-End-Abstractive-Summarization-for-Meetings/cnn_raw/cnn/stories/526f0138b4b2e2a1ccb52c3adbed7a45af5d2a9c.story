(CNN Student News) -- June 5, 2014

Our penultimate program of the 2013-2014 school year includes reports on a controversial prisoner exchange, the damage caused by baseball-size hail, and a poll on whether the American dream is still alive. And with a nod to Coleridge, we'll look at one facility's plans to turn water, water everywhere into many drops to drink.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.
