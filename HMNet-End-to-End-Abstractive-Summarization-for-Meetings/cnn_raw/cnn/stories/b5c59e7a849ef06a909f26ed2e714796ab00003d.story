Dear Girls of the World,

Every female human being has a right to give birth to herself. You have the right to be safe in your body, to explore the world with your mind and to be free in your spirit.

If human rights like these are denied to you -- whether by family or a stranger, by government or religion -- seek out trustworthy people who share your experience.

When unique voices are united in a common cause, they make history.

-- Gloria Steinem
