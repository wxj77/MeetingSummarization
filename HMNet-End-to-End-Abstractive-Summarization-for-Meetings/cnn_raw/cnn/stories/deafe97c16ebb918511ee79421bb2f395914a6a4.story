(Rolling Stone) -- No rock icon has sealed his vault as tightly as Bob Seger.

Six early albums have been out of print for decades, he has no box set, and the words "bonus track" seem to be anathema to him.

He held back on a two-disc hits collection for years, but he's finally relented. Good thing. Previous sets didn't have his 1968 garage-jam classic "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man," and this set has a smoking cover of Little Richard's "Hey Hey Hey Hey (Going Back to Birmingham)."

All the big hits are here, though nothing sounds as glorious as the live "Travelin' Man/Beautiful Loser" medley.

An insane amount of material still remains locked up, however. Hey, Bob, cough it up!
