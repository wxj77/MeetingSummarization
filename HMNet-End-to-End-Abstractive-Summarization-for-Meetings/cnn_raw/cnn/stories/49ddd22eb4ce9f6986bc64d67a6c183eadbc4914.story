(CNN) -- Golfer Rory McIlroy and tennis star Caroline Wozniacki ushered in 2014 by announcing their engagement on social media.

In a sign of the times, they used their respective Twitter accounts to spread the news to their millions of followers, posting pictures of themselves with a ring.

Northern Ireland's McIlroy, who ended 2013 as the sixth-ranked golfer in the world, tweeted: "Happy New Year everyone! I have a feeling it's going to be a great year!! My first victory of 2014 .shesaidyes!!"

Former world number one Wozniacki, from Denmark, reported: "Happy New Year everyone! Rory and I started 2014 with a bang! ... I said YES!!!!"

The pair have been dating since September 2011, but if media rumors were to be believed their romance has endured some difficult moments, particularly as both slipped down the rankings in their respective sports in 2013.

But the pair were clearly firmly an item when strolling down the fairways at the World Tour Championship in Dubai in November as the Dane followed McIlroy every step of the way in the European Tour finale.

It also signaled a return to form for McIlroy, who ended the year by claiming victory at the Australian Open last month.

Wozniacki also regained her place in the top 10 of the WTA rankings with her sole tournament win of 2013 coming at the back end of the year in Luxembourg.

It served as promise that both will restore their respective fortunes, with two-time major winner McIlroy also looking to move back to the No.1 spot now occupied by his Nike stablemate Tiger Woods.
