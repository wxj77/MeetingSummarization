(CNN) -- Top seed Caroline Wozniacki wasted little time in booking her passage into the quarterfinals of the WTA tournament in Copenhagen Thursday.

The Danish favorite beat Pauline Parmentier 6-2 6-1 in second round action as she bids for a third straight title in her home tournament.

Sixth-ranked Wozniacki was tested in her opener against Poland's Urszula Radwanska but was back to her ruthless best against Parmentier of France.

"I got more used to the surface compared to the last match and that was definitely a difference," Wozniacki told the official WTA website.

"It was a very different match compared to the last one."

Another Frenchwoman, Alize Cornet, stands between her and a place in the semifinals and a 13th straight win on the hard courts of the Farum Arena.

Second seed Angelique Kerber of Germany had a much harder fight to dispatch Britain's Anne Keothavong, 4-6 6-3 6-3 and faces compatriot Mona Barthel in the quarterfinals.

Third-seeded Jelena Jankovic showed improved form as she beat Yulia Putintseva in straight sets, dropping only one more game from 3-3 in the first set to win 6-3 6-1.

"I think I played really well today," Jankovic said.

She will play Kaia Kanepi of Estonia in the last eight with the other quarterfinal between Bojana Jovanovski and Petra Martic.

In the Barcelona WTA tournament, Olga Govortsova of Belarus continued her fine run with a hard-fought 7-6 6-7 6-2 win over home player Laura Pous in the second round.

Govortsova put out former French Open champion Francesca Schiavone in her opening match at the clay court event.

Second seed Julia Gorges of Germany also advanced, again in three sets, as she saw off Garbine Muguruza of Spain 7-5 5-7 6-2.
