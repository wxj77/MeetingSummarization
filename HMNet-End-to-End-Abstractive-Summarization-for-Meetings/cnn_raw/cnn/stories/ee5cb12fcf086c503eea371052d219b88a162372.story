Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek police arrested an 18-year-old suspected of having hacked into the electronic systems of the FBI and Interpol, they announced Wednesday.

He reportedly also took over the computers of unsuspecting users, accessed their data and used it to obtain new credit cards in their names. A raid on his home turned up over 120 credit cards and thousands of euros in cash, police said.

He faces charges of computer fraud, forgery, illegal violation of privacy, and illegal weapons possession.

The teen, who was not named, was arrested at his home in Athens, according to the Greek police electronic crime squad.

They seized computers and related equipment as well as flares, shotgun cartridges and a homemade incendiary device, they said.

Greek police said they had been seeking the youth for two years, after attacks that took place in February 2008 and February 2009.

U.S. and French authorities cooperated with the investigation, they said.
