(CNN) -- A dramatic injury-time goal by Juan Mata handed Chelsea a 2-1 victory over Wigan in the English Premier League on Saturday to boost their chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League.

All three goals came in the second half with Branislav Ivanovic opening the scoring Chelsea in the 62nd minute.

Wigan's French midfielder Mohamed Diame looked to have salvaged a point for the second-from-bottom side when he scored in the 82nd minute.

But Juan Mata's goal which came after Fernando Torres' shot hit the post saw the Blues rise to fifth, now two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal.

Tottenham Hotspur moved up to third place with a 0-0 draw against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light but Arsenal can overtake them again if they get a result against Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

League leaders Manchester United are also in action Sunday as they host Queens Park Rangers.

Liverpool's lacklustre form continues as they drew 1-1 at Anfield against Aston Villa.

Should Liverpool sack Kenny Dalglish?

Chris Herd gave the visitors the lead in the 10th minute before Luis Suarez rescued a point for Kenny Dalglish's side eight minutes from the end.

The point lifts Liverpool to eighth with 43 points. Villa remain in 15th place with 34 points.

Blackburn Rovers went down to West Bromwich Albion 3-0 at The Hawthorns to remain in the bottom three.

The win sees West Brom climb to 12th.

Norwich City and Everton drew 2-2 at Carrow Road while Bolton Wanderers suffered a heavy home defeat going down 3-0 to Fulham.

Wolverhampton Wanderers now look certain to be relegated after a 2-1 defeat to Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium.

Peter Crouch claimed the winner which sees Stoke rise to 11th. Wolves remain bottom, six points from safety with just six games remaining.
