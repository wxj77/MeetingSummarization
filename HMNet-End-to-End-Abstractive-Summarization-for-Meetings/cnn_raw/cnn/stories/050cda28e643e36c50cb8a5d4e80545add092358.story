The company was founded in 1968 by Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore, two of the original brains behind one of the major players in early computer chip development, Fairchild Semiconductors.

Intel launched its first microprocessor, the 4004, in November 1971, and it was followed by the 8008 and the 8080, which was used in one of the world's first personal computers.

The 4004, Intel's breakthrough invention, powered the Busicom calculator and paved the way for embedding intelligence in inanimate objects as well as the personal computer

Today the company is still at the forefront in the development of computer chips and microprocessors offering cutting edge chipsets, processors and motherboards.

In 2007 Intel's total revenue was more than $38 billion, with an operating revenue of $8.2 billion and a net income of $7 billion.

The company employs 86,300 people at more than 50 locations across the world, including the Intel Headquarters in Santa Clara, California.

Intel particularly supports Achieve's Mathematics Achievement Partnership (MAP), a unique collaboration among states that will create a new assessment and teaching and learning strategies to assist U.S. 8th-graders in mastering the challenging foundations of algebra and geometry to the level routinely taught in the highest performing countries.
