(CNN) -- Authorities in Utah evacuated a passenger plane Thursday morning after receiving a bomb threat, a spokeswoman for the Salt Lake City International Airport said.

The SkyWest plane, carrying 46 passengers and three crew members, was en route to Salt Lake City from Helena, Montana, when the threat was "called in," said airport spokeswoman Barbara Gann.

The Transportation Security Administration "is aware of an anonymous call reportedly threatening SkyWest Airline Flight 4654," said spokesman Nicholas Kimball. "The plane landed safely without incident. Out of an abundance of caution, law enforcement swept the aircraft with negative findings."

All passengers and luggage were screened and released, and the plane was to be put back into service, said Debbie Bertram of the FBI's Salt Lake City office.

The call "was a threatening call that said that there may be the potential of an incendiary device onboard this aircraft -- so that just unrolled the protocol for a bomb threat," Gann said.

CNN's Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.
