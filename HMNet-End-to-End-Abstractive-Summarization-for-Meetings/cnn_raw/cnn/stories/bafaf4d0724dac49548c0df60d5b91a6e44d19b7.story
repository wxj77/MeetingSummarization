(CNN) -- One person was injured and around 70 trailers were damaged in Springfield, Illinois, on Monday when a microburst with straight line winds of between 70 and 80 mph whipped through the area.

The injured person suffered a minor laceration, said David Butt, director of the Sangamon County Office of Emergency Management.

No trailers overturned.

"The damage occurred from debris. Tree limbs at a height of 10 to 20 feet were broken and they damaged the roofs of the mobile homes," Butt said.

"No roofs were torn off. No roofs were peeled back. The only damage to roofs was being penetrated by wind-blown debris."

Also on Monday, a tornado watch was in effect for parts of north central Kansas and south central Nebraska.

Hail up to 4 inches in diameter and wind gusts as high as 80 mph could accompany those storms.

Looking into Tuesday, there is a slight risk of severe thunderstorms across much of the country's midsection.

The primary threat will be very large hail, mostly in Nebraska, Kansas, western Oklahoma and the eastern Texas panhandle.

A few isolated tornadoes cannot be ruled out.

Cities and towns that will have the highest risk for severe storms Tuesday include Des Moines, Iowa; Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska; Garden City and Liberal, Kansas; and Woodward, Oklahoma and Amarillo in the Texas panhandle.
