London (CNN) -- The two men accused of killing British soldier Lee Rigby in the London neighborhood of Woolwich will stand trial for murder starting on November 18, a judge ruled Friday.

Michael Adebowale, 22, and Michael Adebolajo, 28, appeared in court in London via video conference from separate rooms in jail.

Rigby was killed in a daylight attack a couple of hundred yards from the Royal Artillery Barracks on May 22.

Both men are charged with murder and possession of a firearm, and Adebolajo also is charged with the attempted murder of two police officers.

Adebowale, who was wearing a red T-shirt and pink jogging bottoms, sat with his head down and arms crossed during his video link appearance, while Adebolajo looked straight at the camera.

The latter wore a gray, long-sleeve sweatshirt and had his left arm strapped in a bandage from his wrist to just above the elbow.

Both suspects were hospitalized after their arrest.

The November 18 trial date is preliminary and could change, the court said.

CNN's Lauretta Ihonor and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.
