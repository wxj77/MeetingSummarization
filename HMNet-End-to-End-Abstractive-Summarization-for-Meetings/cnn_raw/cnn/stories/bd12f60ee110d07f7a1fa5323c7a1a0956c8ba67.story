(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy has won the Deutsche Bank Championship by one stroke after shooting a final round 67 at the TPC Boston on Monday.

The Northern Irishman finished on 20-under par, one stroke in front of overnight leader Louis Oosthuizen, who fired a final round 71.

The victory takes McIlroy's career tally of PGA Tour victories to five, three of which have come this season.

Tiger Woods finished third on 18-under par thanks to a final round 66 with Phil Mickelson (66) and Dustin Johnson (70) tied for fourth on 14 under.

McIlroy, who regained the world No.1 spot with victory in last month's U.S.PGA Championship, surged to the top of the leaderboard early on in his final round, firing five birdies on the opening nine.

It was a lead he never relinquished, despite the best efforts of Woods and, in particular, Oosthuizen -- the South African had a chance to force a playoff on the final green, but missed his birdie putt.

The win sees McIlroy replace American Nick Watney at the top of the FedExCup points standings while in finishing third, Woods passed another milestone in his remarkable career.

The 14-time major winner picked up $544,000, helping him become the first player to surpass $100 million in PGA Tour earnings.
