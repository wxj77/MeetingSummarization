"Zayn and Perrie are engaged, but any further detail regarding their relationship is private," the rep said.

Speculation about the pair heated up after Edwards appeared at the London premiere Tuesday of the One Direction documentary "This is Us" sporting a diamond sparkler on her left ring finger.

Edwards' mother, Debbie Dufty, told Real Radio that Malik was traditional and asked her for her daughter's hand in marriage. Dufty said she was thrilled after the pair got engaged on Sunday.

"It's wonderful because Zayn's absolutely gorgeous and Perrie loves him to pieces and it's just perfect," she told the radio station. "They just get on so well together and they understand each other so it's just fabulous!"

Little Mix is a British girl group that formed in 2011 during season eight of the U.K.'s "The X Factor." They have been compared to The Spice Girls.
