(CNN) -- After fighting back persistent rumors of a breakup, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have officially ended their engagement, a rep for actor Hemsworth confirmed.

Cyrus, 20, and Hemsworth, 23, announced they were headed for marriage in June 2012. Since then, however, the couple's relationship has been plagued with rumors of infidelity and temporary splits.

Miley Cyrus was getting her engagement ring fixed, guys

Cyrus spoke more than once about the speculation this spring, tweeting in early March that she was "sick of (Los Angeles) and sick of the lies that come with it," assuring her fans that she hadn't called off her wedding. The "Wrecking Ball" singer met Hemsworth on the set of 2010's "The Last Song," and although they had a bumpy relationship pre-engagement, both sounded content.

"She makes me really happy," Hemsworth shared with Details magazine in February 2012. Months later, Cyrus was "looking forward to a life of happiness" with the "Hunger Games" star.

But according to People magazine, which first reported the scrapped engagement plans, lately Cyrus has had "more breakups than bonding moments" with Hemsworth.

While Cyrus has remained tight-lipped about their romance, the writing seemed to be on her Twitter wall. A few hawk-eyed observers caught on this weekend that Cyrus has stopped following Hemsworth on the social media site.

It's unclear what the status of their relationship is now that they're no longer engaged, and reps have declined to comment further. What is clear is that both stars have a busy fall ahead.

Hemsworth is going to be tied up with promoting the November release of "The Hunger Games" sequel, "Catching Fire," and Cyrus has her new album, "Bangerz," arriving October 8.
