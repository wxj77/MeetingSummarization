(EW.com) -- Geek goddess Sonya Walger is coming back to TV: The "Lost" and "FlashForward" star has landed a series regular role in USA's upcoming "Common Law."

In the buddy cop drama, Warren Kole and Michael Ealy play homicide detectives whose constant quarreling gets them sent to couples therapy. Their shrink? Walger, who will co-star as Dr. Emma Ryan, a smart, attractive psychiatrist with a keen sense of humor. She graduated at the top of her class and started a practice in Beverly Hills but started to feel like a pill dispenser to her rich clientele.

To fill the void, Dr. Ryan started offering low-cost Alcoholics Anonymous and couples' group therapy at the local community center where she applies her strong insight into the relationship between these two police partners.

Walger famously played Penny on "Lost" and has also been in "In Treatment" and "Tell Me You Love Me."

Led by "White Collar" and "Covert Affairs," the network just had its most-watched third quarter in the network's history -- averaging 3.5 million viewers and easily ranking as the most-watched cable network.
