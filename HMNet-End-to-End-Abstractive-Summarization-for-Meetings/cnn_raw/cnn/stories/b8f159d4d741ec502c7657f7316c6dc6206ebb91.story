(CNN) -- Teenage England international midfielder Jack Wilshere has signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal, the Premier League club confirmed on Monday.

The 18-year-old, who made his full international debut against Hungary in August, has been a revelation in the Gunners' midfield this season, making eight league appearances and featuring in all three of Arsenal's Champions League matches.

"It's such great news that Jack has committed his long-term future to the club," manager Arsene Wenger told the London side's official website.

"Jack is a fantastic footballer with a huge amount of potential, and we have all seen with his performances so far that he is a very gifted player, who could be an extremely influential player at the top level of the game.

"At only 18 years of age, there is still so much more to come from him and we're all excited by the fact that Jack Wilshere will be an Arsenal player for years to come."

Wilshere became the youngest-ever player to represent Arsenal in the Premier League, aged 16 years and 256 days, when he played against Blackburn in September 2008.

He said the Emirates was the perfect place for him to be at this fledgling stage of his career.

"I have perfect teammates, perfect fans, perfect backroom staff and most importantly, the perfect manager to help continue that," he said.

"I've got a long way to go before I can become the player I dream of becoming, and I'm sure I'll keep making the odd mistake.

"But it is a massive help for me having a special manager like Arsene Wenger and so many quality teammates and the unbelievable Arsenal fans around me. I believe there is a lot more to come from me."
