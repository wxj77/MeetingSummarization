(CNN) -- The Muslim month of fasting, Ramadan, ended this week, marked across the Islamic world by the feasts of Eid el Fitr.

Traditionally a time spent with family at home, Ramadan has also become a time for reflection for many Syrians displaced by conflict in the country.

According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNCHR), the refugee camp at Za'atari in Jordan is home to around 145,000 Syrians who have fled the ongoing violence. Life there is difficult for its residents, and other Syrians who have found themselves living far from home across the region, from Beirut in Lebanon to Egypt's capital Cairo.

Photographers from the UNCHR captured the period on camera and discovered that, supported by their memories and dreams, those living in Za'atari could work through the struggles of life as a refugee and still observe the holy period.
