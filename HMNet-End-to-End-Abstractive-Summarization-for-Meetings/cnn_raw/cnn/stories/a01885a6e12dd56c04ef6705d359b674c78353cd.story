(CNN Student News) -- May 12, 2014

After a near miss involving a remote-controlled plane and a passenger plane, the FAA is warning Americans about the dangers of drones. We'll have a report on that today, and we'll take you to India for a look at how young people could shape the political future of the world's largest democracy. We'll also show you how a store-bought bouquet of flowers likely traveled over land and sea.
