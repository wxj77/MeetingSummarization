(CNN) -- Comedian Jamie Kaler knows a universal truth: Women love a man in uniform. Sadly, he just can't fit into his anymore.

"I can't snap my dress white bottoms anymore -- I think I put them on for some girl a few years ago."

But these days, the former Navy lieutenant can barely even get his pants all the way up. "How does your thigh grow bigger as you get older?"

However, those pants used to fit a really funny sailor who never took things too seriously.

"I got lowered off of a helicopter onto the ship, and I'm cracking jokes," he recalls. "And they're like, 'This is not funny.' And I'm like, 'Look at me! I'm Chuck Norris!' "

It's been years since Kaler served, but what used to get him in trouble in the Navy now fuels his comedy.

And while some fans may be familiar with his stand-up routine and the show "Kaler" on SiriusXM's Blue Collar Radio, most people know him from his past role as the "drunken red-headed guy" on the TBS comedy "My Boys."

This summer, Kaler will re-team with his "My Boys" co-star Mike Bunin for an original series with DirecTV called "On Deck with Jamie and Mike," where they'll tour some of America's best baseball stadiums.

He also just completed filming for the feature film, "The Wicked."

Kaler sat down with CNN for a video interview in Chicago to discuss life in the Navy, which, apparently, can be a little dirty.
