(CNN) -- A circus elephant injured last year in a drive-by shooting returned to the ring Thursday in the city where she was shot.

"She's doing great -- happy to be back in Tupelo, and happy to be back performing," said Steve Payne, spokesman for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.

Carol the elephant was shot April 2013 on the grounds of BancorpSouth Arena, in Tupelo, Mississippi, while on tour with "The Greatest Show on Earth." She was struck behind her ear.

The 40-year-old Asian elephant took a few weeks off to recover, Payne said. She's performed since the shooting, but Thursday marked the circus' first show back in Tupelo.

Carol has shown no problems or other issues, the spokesman said.

Working with local law enforcement, the circus has stepped up security, he added.

"I have no idea why anyone in the world would want to do something so malicious or stupid," Capt. Rusty Haynes, with the Tupelo police, said last year of the unknown assailant. "It makes no sense to me whatsoever."

Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus is scheduled to be in Tupelo through Sunday.
