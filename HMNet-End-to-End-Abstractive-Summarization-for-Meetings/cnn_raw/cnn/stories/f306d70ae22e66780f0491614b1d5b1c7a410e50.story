(CNN) -- Firefighters Thursday made progress against a massive wildfire 15 miles west of Fort Collins, Colorado, but the blaze was still causing problems, officials said.

The High Park Fire, which has consumed 52,000 acres, jumped Highway 14, prompting the evacuations of 80 residents at Stevens Gulch. Additional residents in the area were on standby to evacuate.

A thunder cell created embers on the western perimeter of the fire, officials said Thursday evening. But weather conditions into Friday were expected to aid firefighters.

The fire, which has claimed at least one life, was estimated to be 15% contained Thursday. The blaze was 10% contained Wednesday.

At least 100 structures are confirmed lost, but hundreds of families were anxiously waiting to hear whether their homes survived.

Hundreds of firefighters from around the United States are assisting local departments that have been battling the fire.
