(CNN) -- IN FOCUS: Gaza's struggling economy

As an IMF delegation heads to Egypt to bash out a deal for a multi-billion dollar loan, MME headed over the border to take a look at one economy that relies heavily on Egyptian stability: Gaza.

Their closure combined with restrictions on exports through Israel is hurting the economy. MME reports.
