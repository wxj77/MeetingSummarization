(CNN) -- It might be a case of illegal clipping.

An American Airlines charter plane carrying the Miami Dolphins home from a losing 30-13 game against the Dallas Cowboys clipped the tail of a parked plane at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport early Thursday morning, forcing both planes out of service and prolonging the team's return.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration and the airline, the incident occurred as the jet was being pushed back in the west cargo area of DFW -- a pad used for sports charters. The winglet of the Dolphins charter plane -- a Boeing 767 -- clipped the tail of an empty MD-80 aircraft, causing minor damage to the 767's winglet.

"That was the biggest hit the Dolphins had all night," quipped one commenter on CNN affiliate WPLG-TV's website.

There were no injuries and both planes were taken out of service for inspection, American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller told CNN.

American brought a replacement plane and the charter left around 4 a.m., arriving in South Florida at 7:20 a.m. Thursday.
