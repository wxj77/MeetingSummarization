(CNN) -- Three workers were killed in an explosion and fire near an oil well in eastern Wyoming on Monday morning.

Samson Resources Company, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based oil and gas company, confirmed the accident in Converse County, which occurred shortly after 10 a.m.

No other details of the accident were available. Local emergency teams responded to bring the fire under control.

All three workers were contract personnel, the company said in a statement. It has several oil wells in Wyoming.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of those who died in this accident," said Phil Schmucker, senior vice president of operations for Samson. "Samson will work closely with federal, state and local officials to assist with the investigation of this tragic incident and will work with the combined team to provide updates on the situation as the investigation continues."
