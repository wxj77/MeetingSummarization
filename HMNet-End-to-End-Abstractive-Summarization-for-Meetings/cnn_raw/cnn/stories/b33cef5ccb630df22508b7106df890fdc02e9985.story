(CNN)  -- Serena Williams produced a dominating performance to beat Maria Sharapova 6-1 6-3 to reach the semifinals of the WTA tournament in Stanford.

The former world number one only returned to action last month after a lengthy layoff for injury and illness, but showed she is close to returning to the form that has brought her 13 grand slam titles.

Williams, playing only her third tournament since winning Wimbledon in 2010, is currently ranked 169th in the world but made light work of the fifth-seeded Russian.

"I've just been trying my hardest and practicing and trying to get back in the top 100, Williams told the official WTA website.

"It's a little crazy, but hopefully..."

Sharapova has not beaten Williams since 2004 and admitted she had not been at her best.

"She was serving and returning quite powerfully, and I felt I was extremely late. I didn't have my timing today at all.

"Even when I had chances to change things around, I didn't do it."

Williams next faces big-hitting German Sabine Lisicki, who reached the semifinals at Wimbledon where she was beaten by runner-up Sharapova.

Lisicki was a 7-6 2-6 6-2 winner over fifth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland in an earlier quarterfinal Friday.

The other semifinal will be between third seed Marion Bartoli and improving eighth seed Dominika Cibulkova. France's Bartoli beat Japan's Ayumi Morita, who retired after trailing by a set.

Cibulkova enjoyed a 6-1 6-1 defeat of New Zealand's Marina Erakovic, who had . beaten top seed and defending champion Victoria Azarenka in the second round Thursday.
