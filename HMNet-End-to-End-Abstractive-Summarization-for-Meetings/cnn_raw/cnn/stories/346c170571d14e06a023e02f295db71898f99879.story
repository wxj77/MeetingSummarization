Today's international coverage kicks off in Egypt, where unrest abounds three years after the African country's revolution. We examine how corporate earnings and emerging markets are affecting the U.S. stock market, and we meet a Ugandan entrepreneur whose success is in the bag. Plus, a new survey fields American's opinions about their nation's most popular sport.
