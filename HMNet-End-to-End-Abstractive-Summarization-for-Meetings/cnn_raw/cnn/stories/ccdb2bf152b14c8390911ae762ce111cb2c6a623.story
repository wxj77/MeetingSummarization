(CNN) -- How close are you to the airport? Is there a decent bar or restaurant on site? The worn-down, travel-weary businessperson is looking for proximity, convenience and comfortable amenities in an airport hotel. There's little time to waste.

The Regal Airport Hotel in Hong Kong seems to know what satisfies the road warrior. The hotel was recently named No. 1 in the airport hotel category of the 2013 Skytrax World Airport Awards. (Earlier this month, CNN featured the world's top airport award-winner.)

Hong Kong's Regal Airport Hotel secured the top spot for the third year in a row and was also named the best airport hotel in Asia. An enclosed bridge directly connects the hotel to the airport's passenger terminal, so being on time for your flight shouldn't be a problem. The nearly 1,200 room hotel also has six restaurants and bars, in-house conference and meeting facilities, a spa and indoor and outdoor pools.

Skytrax's World Airport Awards are based on 12.1 million survey questionnaires filled out by passengers covering 108 different nationalities and 395 airports worldwide during a nine-month survey period in 2012 and 2013.

The airport hotel survey covered topics such as arrival and departure (access to the hotel from the airport, availability of hotel shuttles/taxis, waiting times at check-in): room comfort (size, cleanliness, comfort, Internet/Wi-Fi, television/audio options); hotel amenities (restaurant and bar, price of food and drink, fitness and spa options); staff (friendliness/courtesy, room service efficiency, staff language skills) and value for money.
