(CNN) -- Top seed Caroline Wozniacki and tournament favorite Serena Williams both came through third round matches in straight sets Saturday at the U.S .Open.

Wozniacki, still seeking her first grand slam title, completed a comfortable 6-2 6-4 victory over America's Vania King.

The Danish world number one will now play either former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova or Uzbekistan's Akgul Amanmuradova for a place in the quarterfinals.

"It's great to be through. I was fighting and getting a lot of balls back. It was windy out there so it was quite difficult to play," said Wozniacki, who has collected six tour titles in 2011.

If the seedings go to form, she could face Williams, who survived a second-set fightback from fourth seed Victoria Azarenka before winning  6-1 7-6 (7-5) on Arthur Ashe.

Williams, seeking a fourth U.S. Open crown, powered through the first set and looked set to complete a routine straight sets victory as she led 5-3 in the second.

Azarenka had to save three match points on her service before breaking her American opponent to force a tiebreak.

But Williams, seeded a lowly 28th after injury and illness, kept her nerve to go through.

Seventh seed Francesca Schiavone from Italy is also through to the fourth round after coming from a set down to beat South Africa's Chanelle Scheepers 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, while Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro beat her compatriot Silvia Soler-Espinosa 6-0, 6-4.

But 11th seed Jelena Jankovic went out, beaten by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia 6-4 6-4.
