(CNN) -- Mark Cavendish claimed his second successive victory with another power-packed sprint at the end of the 227.5km sixth stage of the Tour de France from Montargis to Gueugnon.

The Briton dispelled doubts about his form by winning Thursday's fifth stage -- and he doubled up in impressive fashion, beating rivals Tyler Farrar and Alessandro Petacchi after again receiving a perfect lead-out from HTC-Columbia teammate Mark Renshaw.

There was no significant change in the overall classification with Fabian Cancellara retaining the race leader's yellow jersey from Geraint Thomas.

However, Team Sky's Thomas clawed back three seconds on the Swiss because of a slight split in the peloton and he now trails by just 20 seconds overall.

World champion Cadel Evans remains third, 39 seconds adrift, while race favorites Andy Schleck (sixth overall), Alberto Contador (ninth) and Lance Armstrong (18th) all finished safely in the peloton.

Friday's stage -- the longest in this year's race -- again saw three riders launch an early breakaway.

At one stage, Ruben Perez Moreno, Sebastian Lang and Mathieu Perget held an advantage of eight minutes over the main bunch.

However, the race came together with just 10km remaining and a confident Cavendish never looked like being stopped once the sprint for the line unfolded.

"I followed Mark Renshaw as usual and it was just a case of finishing off the incredible work that my teammates did for me," Cavendish -- who was securing his 12th career stage win -- told the official Tour de France website.

Saturday's seventh stage to Station des Rousses sees the race hit the medium mountains and will see some of leading contenders for overall success come to the fore.
