(CNN) -- Jennifer Lawrence isn't just an Oscar-winning actress. She's now a chart-climbing singer, too.

Lawrence's song "The Hanging Tree" from "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part I" debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

That chart tracks the top 100 popular songs in the U.S. each week, and Lawrence's single is sandwiched between Nick Jonas' "Jealous" and Meghan Trainor's "Lips Are Movin'."

That's not bad for an actress who's claimed she has a "tone-deaf" singing voice.

"I do not like singing in front of other people. That's my biggest fear," Lawrence told David Letterman on "The Late Show" in November. "I'm, like, scarred from my childhood because I have a mother who would just tell me that I was amazing at everything and that I could do everything, and I can't."

Oh, but it would seem she can. According to Billboard, Lawrence is just the 13th acting Oscar winner to also notch a spot on the Hot 100 chart. She follows in the footsteps of stars like Bing Crosby, Julie Andrews, Cher, Jamie Foxx, Meryl Streep and Jennifer Hudson.

"The Hanging Tree" was written by "Hunger Games" author Suzanne Collins and Lumineers musicians Jeremiah Fraites and Wesley Schultz. Lawrence shares a credit on the song with James Newton Howard, who provided the score for "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part I."

The soundtrack for the movie, which features Lorde, Bat for Lashes, Charli XCX and CHVRCHES, is proving just as popular as Lawrence's song. Since its debut November 17, it's remained in the top 10 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and is at No. 40 on Billboard's Top 200 albums chart.

"Mockingjay -- Part I," the third installment in the four-part "Hunger Games" franchise, has also been the expected hit at the box office. It's earned $231 million domestically since it opened November 21.
