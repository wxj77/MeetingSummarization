(EW.com) -- Just call it the real-life "Entourage" ... with extra cheese.

A&E announced today that brothers Mark and Donnie Wahlberg have inked a deal to appear in and executive produce a new unscripted series called "Wahlburgers," which will go behind the scenes of their family's Boston-based burger joint.

Donnie broke the news about the series during an appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show" Monday night. (And yes, that was indeed one of the most '80s sentences ever written.)

In addition to the two most famous Wahlbergs, the show will also feature real-life characters, including their brother Paul, who serves as the restaurant's executive chef, their spitfire mother Alma, and Wahlberg cousin Johnny Alves â€” a.k.a. the real Johnny Drama.
