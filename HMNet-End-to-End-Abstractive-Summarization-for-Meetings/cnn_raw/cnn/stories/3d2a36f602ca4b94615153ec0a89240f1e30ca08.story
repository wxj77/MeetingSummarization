(CNN) -- A 36-year-old crew member on a Disney Cruise Line ship was arrested in a Florida port on Thursday on suspicion of molestation and false imprisonment, officials said.

Disney said it notified police about an incident that was alleged to have occurred Thursday morning while the ship was at Port Canaveral.

Canaveral Port Authority Police said Ahmed Sofyan faces two charges of lewd or lascivious molestation and one charge of false imprisonment.

The alleged victim is 13 years old and doesn't know the suspect, police said.

Disney said the man was fired.

"We have no tolerance whatsoever for the behavior alleged in this incident," said Karl Holz, president of Disney Cruise Line.

It was unclear if Sofyan, who police say is from Indonesia, has a lawyer. He was taken to the Brevard County jail.
