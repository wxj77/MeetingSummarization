(CNN) -- Bolivian President Evo Morales reinstated 17 of his 20 ministers and replaced three in a Cabinet shakeup Sunday, the state-run ABI news agency reported.

All 20 ministers had stepped down earlier in the day to coincide with the start of the president's sixth year in office.

Morales replaced his production, environment and energy ministers with Ana Teresa Morales, Julieta Monje Villa and Jose Luis Gutierrez respectively, ABI reported.

The shakeup comes one month after the government ended fuel subsidies.

As gas prices shot up, major protests erupted, forcing Morales to reinstate the subsidies at the end of December.

The president asked members of his new Cabinet for "compromise" and "sacrifice" as they begin their work, ABI reported.
