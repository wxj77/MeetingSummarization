(CNN) -- A Lion Air Boeing 737-900 collided with a cow when landing on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.

The plane, on a domestic route that started in Jakarta, landed at Jalaluddin Airport in Gorontalo on Tuesday evening and hit one of three cows wandering on the runway.

The aircraft skidded off the runway and the cow was killed, though none of the 110 passengers on board were injured.

Several flights were canceled and the airport was temporarily closed on Tuesday due to the accident. Operations were resumed on Wednesday.

Gorontalo governor Rusli Habibie told the Jakarta Post the airport suffered from inadequate fencing.

"Lion Air management has just told me that animals, particularly dogs, are often seen on the runway," said Habibie. "This problem should be immediately resolved."

Government administrators are due to meet with the National Transportation Safety Committee and Jalaluddin Airport officials to discuss ways to prevent similar events in future.

In April this year another Lion Air flight carrying 108 people to Bali crashed into the sea after missing the runway.

All 101 passengers and seven crew were evacuated with only a few injuries reported.
