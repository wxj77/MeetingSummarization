Former Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates and three other people were arrested in connection with an investigation into suspected tax fraud, corruption and money laundering, the country's prosecutor general's office said Saturday.

Socrates, who was detained late Friday, was due to appear before a judge for questioning on Saturday regarding an investigation of suspicious banking operations and money transfers, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office.

Socrates was prime minister from 2005 to 2011, when he stepped down after his socialist government was unable to push though austerity measures, which were intended to preclude a bailout to ease the country's debt crisis.
