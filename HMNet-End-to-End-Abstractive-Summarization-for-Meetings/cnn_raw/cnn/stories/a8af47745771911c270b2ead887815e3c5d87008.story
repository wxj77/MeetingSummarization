(Rolling Stone) -- Metallica, Stevie Wonder and Neil Young and Crazy Horse will anchor the 2012 edition of Outside Lands, to be held in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park on August 10-12.

Other acts tapped for the festival include Skrillex, Jack White, Foo Fighters, Beck, Sigur RÃ³s, fun., Justice, Norah Jones, the Kills, Of Monsters and Men, Alabama Shakes and Grandaddy.

Given Outside Lands' affiliation with Bonnaroo, a certain eclecticism in the lineup is to be expected; other acts slated for the fest this year range from post-rock (Explosions in the Sky) and hip-hop (Big Boi) to jazz (Dirty Dozen Brass Band) and folk (Father John Misty). Additional performers include Passion Pit, Andrew Bird, Dispatch, Portugal. The Man, Dr. Dog, Die Antwoord and Block Party.

Now in its fifth year, Outside Lands pairs music with wine and food, billing itself as "the world's only gourmet music festival." Essentially a wine festival inside a music festival, the event features a dedicated area called Wine Lands that makes use of the neighboring wine-producing regions of Napa and Sonoma by hosting more than 30 regional wineries. There will also be satellite operations from more than 50 of the area's finest restaurants; food trucks will appear alongside booths from some of the region's top chefs.

Tickets for Outside Lands go on sale on April 19. A full lineup and additional details can be found on the festival's official website.
