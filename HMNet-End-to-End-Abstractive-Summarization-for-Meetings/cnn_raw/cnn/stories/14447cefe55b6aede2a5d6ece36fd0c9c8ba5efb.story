(CNN) -- The Disney Channel's "Girl Meets World" will meet its eager audience in June.

The cable network has announced that "Girl Meets World," a spinoff of '90s comedy "Boy Meets World," will have its official debut on June 27 following a four-hour marathon of "Boy Meets World" on June 15.

"Boy Meets World" ran for seven seasons on ABC between 1993 and 2000, and starred Ben Savage and Danielle Fishel. The two actors played Cory Matthews and Topanga Lawrence, a pair of friends who later become love interests and eventually marry.

The "Girl Meets World" spinoff has Fishel and Savage reprising their characters, except they're no longer the story's main focus. Instead, "Girl Meets World" follows the coming-of-age tale of Cory and Topanga's tween daughter, Riley (Rowan Blanchard). The couple also have a young son, Auggie, played by August Maturo.

The new Disney series is expected to hit many of the same themes as "Boy Meets World." That show followed the mischievous adventures of Cory and his best friend, Shawn (Rider Strong), and "Girl Meets World" pairs Riley with a "bold" best friend of her own, Maya. And also like its predecessor, the central characters start off in middle school, where Cory Matthews works as the girls' history teacher.

While the plot will focus on Riley and her friends, there will be no shortage of "Boy Meets World" characters in the spinoff. Rider Strong, William Daniels (Mr. Feeney), Lee Norris (Minkus) and the actors who played Cory's parents, William Russ and Betsy Randle, are all expected to appear.

For fans who can't hold out until June, Disney's also offering the series premiere via its digital service, Watch Disney Channel, starting May 21 for verified subscribers.

"Girl Meets World" will premiere June 27 at 9:45 p.m. ET/PT before moving to its regular time slot of 8:30 p.m. ET/PT on July 11.
