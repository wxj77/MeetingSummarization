(CNN) -- The Dallas Mavericks took a giant leap towards this year's NBA title Thursday, as they swept aside the Miami Heat in front of their own fans.

Dirk Nowitzki was again the hero, notching 29 points as the Mavs ran out 112-103 winners in Game 5 to take a 3-2 lead in the seven-game series.

The giant German was one of five Dallas players to reach double figures for the evening.

One more victory will see the Texans win their first ever NBA championship.

"We have to go down there (Miami) and basically approach Sunday's game as game seven," Nowitzki told reporters, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse.

Meanwhile, Miami forward Dwyane Wade was forced to play through the pain barrier with a hip injury, but still managed to finish as the top scorer for the Heat with 23 points.

Teammate LeBron James also caught the attention at both ends of the court with 17 points, including a triple double, and 10 rebounds, before he faded out of the game.

However the visitors could not keep up with the pace as Nowitzki and Jason Terry in particular took the game to them. At one stage in the final quarter, the Mavs went on a 17-4 run.

"We've been waiting on an offensive night for us where we finally shoot the ball well, added Nowitzki. "We felt like we had opportunities in the first four games, just couldn't knock anything down. So that was encouraging to see today that we made some shots."

Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the team would be focusing on its inability to close out games. "We haven't been able to do it consistently enough in this series," he said, in quotes carried by Reuters.com.

Their next opportunity will come on home court in Miami on Sunday.
