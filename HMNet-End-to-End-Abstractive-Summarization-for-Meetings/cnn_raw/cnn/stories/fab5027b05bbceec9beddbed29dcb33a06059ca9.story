(CNN) -- Actor Edward Furlong tried to hide, but ended up caught and behind bars in California for allegedly violating a protective order filed against him by an ex-girlfriend, authorities said.

West Hollywood, California, deputies responded at 5:44 p.m. Thursday to a call about a possible violation of a protection order, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Friday in a news release.

They found the suspect -- the 35-year-old actor best known for his role in "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" -- hiding on a nearby property. He was arrested and brought to a sheriff's substation in West Hollywood, authorities said.

The protective order was imposed after the actor was arrested following a domestic disturbance at the same address in January, the sheriff's department said. He was then charged with felony domestic violence and domestic battery.

The actor, who was already serving probation, is being held on $100,000 bond, according to Los Angeles County jail records.

After his breakthrough role as John Connor in 1991's "Terminator 2" alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, Furlong went on to play roles in a number of movies, including "American History X," and TV projects, such as "CSI-NY."
