The U.S. Coast Guard is searching for a 13-year-old boy who went cliff jumping into the water with friends  in Hawaii -- but never resurfaced.

The boy jumped off a 15-foot cliff near Hapuna Beach State Park on Hawaii's Big Island, the Coast Guard said. Authorities have been looking for the boy since midday Sunday.

Authorities are searching above, beneath and on the water's surface.

Dive teams have scoured underwater, and the Coast Guard has been scanning by boat and helicopter.
