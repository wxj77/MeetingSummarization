(CNN) -- Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee and Korean Kim Do-hoon both carded eight-under-par rounds of 64 to lead the way after the opening 18 holes of the China Open at Jinji Lakes.

Asian No.1 Jaidee, who was forced to withdraw from last week's Masters due to an elbow problem, posted a bogey-free round after receiving an injection for his injury prior to leaving Augusta.

The 40-year-old told the official European Tour Web site: "I played very solid after a week off last week. I had a good game plan.

"I was unable to practice on the course before, I only played two holes in the pro-am because the weather was terrible.

"But I hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens and I made a lot of putts. Over the next few days, if my health stays OK, as my arm is getting better and better everyday, I hope to get better and better."

Kim, 21, hit eight birdies and an eagle as he continued the fine form he showed when finishing third at the Chengdu Open tournament earlier this month.

Spain's Pablo Larrazabal, Welshman Jamie Donaldson and China's Wen-chong Liang head the chasing pack two strokes behind, while American Ryder Cup captain Corey Pavin is among four players a further stroke back after carding a bogey-free 67.
