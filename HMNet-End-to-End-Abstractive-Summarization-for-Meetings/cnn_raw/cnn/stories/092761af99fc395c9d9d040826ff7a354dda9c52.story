(CNN) -- Three-time Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel has extended his deal with Red Bull through to the end of the 2015 season.

The German is on course for a fourth straight drivers' championship title after victory at the Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday saw him extend his lead at the top of the standings to 36 points.

Vettel has reigned supreme over the sport since landing his first title in 2010 and has now added an extra 12 months onto his current deal.

The 25-year-old had been linked with rival marques such as Ferrari and Mercedes but has put an end to the speculation by signing a new contract.

"Infiniti Red Bull Racing is happy to confirm that World Champion Sebastian Vettel has extended his multi-year contract with the team until the end of 2015," a Red Bull statement read.

"A previous member of the Red Bull Junior squad, Sebastian first drove for Red Bull Racing in 2009.

"During his Formula One career, the 25-year-old has achieved 29 wins, 51 podiums and 39 pole positions.

"He is the current Formula One World Champion and also a triple World Champion, having retained the title since he first won it in 2010."

Vettel and Red Bull have dominated the elite division of motorsport since the landmark campaign in 2010 when Vettel won the drivers' title and his team the constructors' championship.

The following year Vettel secured a record points total of 392, winning 11 of the 17 races that year.

In 2012 Vettel won by a much closer margin -- just three points separated him and Ferrari's Spanish driver Fernando Alonso.

Victory meant he became the youngest ever triple world champion at 25, and matched the hat-trick of titles achieved by Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher.

Vettel has won three out of seven races this season and after leading from start to finish in Canada on Sunday he extended his lead over Alonso to 36 points.
