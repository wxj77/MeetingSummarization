(CNN) -- Serena Williams made a winning return from a left ankle injury by defeating Zhang Shuai in the second round of the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami.

Williams, seeded 10th, had not been in WTA action since losing to Ekaterina Makarova in the last 16 of the Australian Open.

However, she was always in control against her Chinese opponent, easing through 6-2 6-3 in just 80 minutes.

The 30-year-old Williams, who has won the tournament five times, now faces 21st seed Roberta Vinci of Italy, who defeated Tsvetana Pironkova 7-5 6-1.

Another former world number one, Kim Clijsters, is also through to the third round after getting over some of the rustiness that plagued her first round performance.

The Belgian struggled to defeat Slovak Jarmila Gajdosova on Wednesday, but was far more impressive in dismissing 14th seed Julia Goerges 6-2 7-5 on Thursday.

However, there was disappointment for yet another former world number one, Jelena Jankovic, after the 13th-seeded Serb was crushed 6-0 6-3 by Mona Barthel of Germany.

Meanwhile, Russian second seed Maria Sharapova was given a scare, dropping the opening set before rallying to defeat Israel's Shahar Peer 4-6 6-3 6-3.

Fourth seed Caroline Wozniacki, another woman to have occupied top spot in the world rankings, breezed through her opening match, beating Czech world No. 59 Barbora Zahlavova Strycova 6-4 6-0.

The 2011 French Open champion Li Na also progressed, the Chinese eighth seed recorded a 7-5 6-2 win over Hungarian qualifier Melinda Czink.

Also through to the last 32 are US Open champion Samantha Stosur, 12th seed Sabine Lisicki, 17th seed Shuai Peng and 23rd seed Yanina Wickmayer, who all progressed in straight sets.

But 25th seed Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain crashed out 1-6 6-4 6-0 to South African Chanelle Scheepers, while two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, seeded 26th, lost 1-6 7-6 7-6 to Czech Iveta Benesova.
