(CNN) -- Five people died when a regional airliner crashed and caught fire just short of a runway in Red Lake, Ontario, Canada, police said.

Two people survived the Bearskin Airlines crash Sunday night, said Ontario police Sgt. Rob McDonough. He said a male passenger managed to pull a female passenger to safety before the plane was engulfed by flames.

Two pilots and three passengers died. They were not identified.

McDonough said everyone aboard was a Canadian citizen.

The 19-passenger Metro Fairchild had taken off from Sioux Lookout.

The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said its investigators would arrive at the scene Monday.
