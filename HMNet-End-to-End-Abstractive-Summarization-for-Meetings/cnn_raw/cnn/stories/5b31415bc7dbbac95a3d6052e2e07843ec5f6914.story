(CNN) -- A 48-year-old man faces several charges stemming from a flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Portland, Oregon, authorities said.

Donald Robert Welty is suspected of attempted assault on a police officer, disorderly conduct and harassment, according to Ansley Bernatz of Multnomah County Detention Center in Oregon. He is out on bail after his arrest Thursday.

The Portland man faced federal charges of interference with flight crew and assault of a federal official, but the U.S. Marshals Service dropped a hold on Welty's detainment, Bernatz said.

Details about the incident onboard were not immediately available. Representatives for the U.S. Marshals did not immediately return calls for comment.

Anthony Black, a spokesman for Delta, told CNN the airline "cooperated with the air marshals while in flight and provided assistance once it was on the ground in Portland."

Delta did not provide any further information.
