Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A suicide attack in eastern Afghanistan Monday killed 14 people, including three NATO service members and four Afghan police, and wounded 57 others, a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry said.

The bomber targeted a joint patrol of ISAF forces and Afghan police, using an explosives-packed motorcycle, according to Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for the ministry, which condemned the attack.

NATO's International Security Assistance Force confirmed the attack, saying three ISAF service members and their interpreter died in a bombing in eastern Afghanistan Monday.

Their nationalities of the ISAF forces were not immediately available.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack, saying a suicide bomber had killed eight foreign forces and six Afghan security forces. The Taliban regularly reports higher casualty figures than either NATO or the Afghan government.

CNN's Esprit Smith contributed to this report.
