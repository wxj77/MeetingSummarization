(EW.com) -- For its upcoming miniseries "The 80s: The Decade that Made Us," Nat Geo Channel commissioned a pop culture survey asking participants important questions like, "Which of the following songs would you have made out to in the '80s?" and "Which of the following '80s TV family would you most want to be adopted by?"

EW.com has an exclusive sneak peek at those results...

"The Cosby Show's" Huxtables are the family of choice, with 38 percent of the vote. "Family Ties'" Keatons and "Dallas's" Ewings tied for second, with 17 percent each. "Growing Pains'" Seavers finished next with 16 percent, and "Diff'rent Strokes'" Drummonds came in last, with 7 percent.
