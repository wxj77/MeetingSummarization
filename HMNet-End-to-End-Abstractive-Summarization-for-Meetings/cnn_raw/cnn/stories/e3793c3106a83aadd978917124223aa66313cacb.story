(EW.com) -- Starz announced today that current "Dancing With the Stars" pro Derek Hough and his sister, former "DWTS" darling and now singer-actress Julianne Hough ("Safe Haven," "Rock of Ages," "Footloose"), will executive-produce "Blackpool," a scripted series exploring the "the darker side of the glamorous world of ballroom dance," according to the network.

The Houghs will also serve as head choreographers for the series.

"Viewers are going to see a twisted, sexy, funny, dark and passionate side of the drama and politics in the world of ballroom dance that delves deeper than spray tans and sequins," promised Derek, a three-time Emmy nominee for his reality TV choreography.

The series will revolve around the prestigious annual ballroom competition in Blackpool, England â€” a stomping ground the Hough siblings, who trained in England, know well.

"Their experiences growing up in this highly competitive world are riveting and also shocking," said Carmi Zlotnik, Starz' managing director. "There is much more to uncover than what we see on the dance floor."
