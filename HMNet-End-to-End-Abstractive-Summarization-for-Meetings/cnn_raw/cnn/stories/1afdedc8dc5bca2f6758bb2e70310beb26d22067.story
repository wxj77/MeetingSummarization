Los Angeles (CNN) -- Pamela Anderson is splitting from husband Rick Salomon just months after marrying him for a second time, her publicist said Tuesday.

The "Baywatch" actress and Playboy model filed for divorce in Los Angeles, but she's not sharing details of their irreconcilable differences.

"We ask the media to please respect Pamela and her family's privacy during this time," a statement from Anderson publicistÂ Ann Gurrola said.

Anderson, 47, first married Salomon, who had been a longtime friend, in 2007. The couple divorced in 2008.

The two remained "best friends with benefits," Anderson said last year after they were spotted together on a beach.

Anderson revealed last January that she had retied the marital knot with Salomon, saying she was "very happy."

This would be Anderson's fourth divorce. She previously married and divorced musicians Tommy Lee and Kid Rock -- one time for each.

Salomon, 46, was previously married to actresses Shannen Doherty and Elizabeth Daily.

Salomon's biggest claim to fame -- or infamy -- may be his 2003 performance opposite Paris Hilton in a sex tape distributed under the title "1 Night in Paris."
