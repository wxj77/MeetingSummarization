(CNN) -- Some say it's funny, some call it creepy. Either way, a new Old Spice commercial dubbed "Momsong" has the Internet buzzing.

The commercial, part of a series called "Smellcome To Manhood," promotes a new line of Old Spice body sprays. The sprays, according to the ad, quickly turns teenage boys into men -- something that a group of moms in the commercial apparently aren't ready to come to terms with.

One mom is seen hiding behind the door in her son's bedroom as she sadly sings about her boy quickly becoming a man after using Old Spice. The song is picked up by other moms as they spy on their sons hanging out with girls.

The ad rocketed to viral status on Sunday when it was shown at commercial breaks during the NFL playoff games. Within a day, the term "Old Spice" was tweeted over 50,000 times, according to social analytics company, Topsy, and the video has had more than 1 million views since it was posted a few days ago.

Reaction on Twitter was fast and furious.

This isn't the first viral commercial for the brand. A series of commercials featuring pitchman Terry Crews won the internet's heart a few years ago with his pectoral flexes and ear shattering screams.

"Momsong" may be just the beginning for Old Spice's new campaign. The company's YouTube page features two other new "Smellcome to Manhood" commercials in the vein of "Momsong." We will just have to wait to see what they have in store for the upcoming Super Bowl, an event known to feature bizarre commercials.
