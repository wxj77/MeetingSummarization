The ceremony will probably last around an hour.

Getting to the church

The bride-to-be will travel to Westminster Abbey by car, rather than horse-drawn carriage as Diana, Princess of Wales did on her wedding day 30 years ago.

It's likely Kate will leave from one of the London palaces or possibly an exclusive London hotel, while Prince William will start off from Clarence House, Prince William's official residence, though these details are yet to be confirmed by the Prince's office.

The venue

Westminster Abbey is over 700 years old and holds 2,200 people. It's been the site of coronations since William I's in 1066.

Westminster Abbey: In-depth profile

Many royal weddings have taken place here, including current queen, Elizabeth II's to Prince Philip in 1947. The Abbey is considered a more modest, but fittingly grand, alternative to the larger St Paul's Cathedral.

Key players

The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, will marry the couple. The Dean of Westminster will conduct the service.

The Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, will give the address. He is a family friend of the Windsors and spoke at Diana, Princess of Wales's memorial in 2007.

William has chosen his younger brother, Prince Harry, third in line to the throne, as best man. Kate's sister Philippa, often known as Pippa, will be her maid of honor.

There will be four younger bridesmaids and two younger page boys, including two of William's godchildren.

The music

Two choirs, one orchestra, a fanfare team and trumpeters will play at the wedding:

- The Choir of Westminster Abbey, formed of 20 boys and 12 professional singers. The Abbey's sub-organist will play the organ.

- The Chapel Royal Choir, formed of 10 boys and six professional singers.

- The London Chamber Orchestra, the longest established professional chamber orchestra in the UK. Its 39 members will play from the organ loft in the Abbey.

- The Fanfare Team from the Central Band of the Royal Air Force, which consists of seven players and their conductor.

- The State Trumpeters of The Household Cavalry, eight trumpeters drawn from the Band of the Life Guards and the Band of the Blues and Royals.

The guests

Around 1,900 people have been invited to the main ceremony at Westminster Abbey, mainly made up of the couple's friends and family.

The other guests will be members of foreign royal families, heads of state, members of the army, navy and air force and around 80 regular joes from the charities Prince William supports.

Six hundred people have been invited to a lunchtime reception at Buckingham Palace hosted by The Queen. Just three hundred people have been asked to an exclusive dinner in the evening thrown by Charles, Prince of Wales.

The biggest snub so far is for Sarah Ferguson, ex-wife of Andrew, Duke of York, who has not been invited.

Royal procession

After the ceremony, the newlyweds will travel back to Buckingham Palace in a horse-drawn five-carriage procession, along a set route lined by fans and well-wishers. The route takes in some of London's most historic places: Parliament Square, Whitehall, Horse Guards Parade and The Mall.

William and Kate will likely use the 1902 State Landau, which Prince Charles and his first wife, the late Diana, Princess of Wales also used at their wedding. If it's raining, the newlyweds will revert to the Glass Coach, which has a roof. The white-looking Windsor Greys, which are usually reserved for the Queen, will pull the newlyweds.
