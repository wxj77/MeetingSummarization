Outgoing Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who said just a few weeks ago that Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst was "wrong for the state of Iowa," has changed his tune.

Harkin, who was an ardent supporter of Democratic Congressman Bruce Braley in the race to succeed him, sees promise in Ernst as she prepares to represent the Hawkeye state for the next six years.

"I think she has the potential to be one, yes," Harkin told reporters in typical "Iowa nice" fashion on Capitol Hill, when asked if Ernst would be a good senator. They all have the potential when they come here. I think maybe some of the statements she's made in the past -- I don't know -- you know people grow, people grow into jobs. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt."

The senator got into hot water while campaigning against her when he compared Ernst's looks to Taylor Swift as the race came to a close, though he's apparently shaken off the results.

"Obviously I was disappointed that Bruce Braley didn't get elected. Fine guy, great congressman, but hey, that's the breaks of elections, right?" he said.

Ernst beat Braley by eight points in the midterms earlier this month. Her win was a key seat Republicans needed to take the majority in the upper chamber.

Harkin did reach out to Ernst on election night to congratulate her for running a "great campaign" but didn't offer any other details.

Asked for advice he would give Ernst as he concludes his 40-year career in Washington, Harkin said "if you want to be a good senator, when you come here, forget about the headlines, learn the rules, try to get on good committees, and think about the long term -- about what you can do for your state, for Iowa, in the long term because things don't happen overnight around here. You gotta start thinking about what you want to do that may take you four or five or six years or even beyond to get accomplished."
