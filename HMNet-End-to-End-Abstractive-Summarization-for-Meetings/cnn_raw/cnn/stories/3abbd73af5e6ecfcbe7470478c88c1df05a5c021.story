TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Typhoon Melor roared into central Japan on Thursday, leaving two people dead and lashing the region with heavy rain and gusty winds.

Utility poles lie buckled in the wake of Typhoon Melor.

The storm stayed west of Tokyo, but still caused enough trouble to shut down trains for a time and snarl commuter traffic. Numerous flights were canceled and delayed at the city's two major airports.

In western and northern  Japan, Melor tore roofs off homes, downed power lines and flooded roads.

The storm contributed to the deaths of a 54-year-old newspaper delivery man in Wakayama, who ran into a fallen tree, and a 69-year-old man from Saitama, who was crushed by a tree.

By late Thursday, Melor had weakened to a tropical storm and was heading out to sea.
