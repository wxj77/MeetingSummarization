(CNN) -- Tom Hanks and Sting were among the honorees selected Thursday to receive the 37th annual Kennedy Center Honors.

The list consists of Hanks, the two-time Oscar-winning actor known for such films as "Forrest Gump" and "Saving Private Ryan"; Sting, the former Police frontman whose new musical, "The Last Ship," will open on Broadway this fall; and Al Green, the Memphis soul singer whose hits include "Let's Stay Together," "Love and Happiness" and "Tired of Being Alone."

Also being honored: comedian and actress Lily Tomlin, whose career includes the TV show "Laugh-In," the film "9 to 5" and the stage show "The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe"; and ballerina Patricia McBride.

"The Kennedy Center celebrates five extraordinary individuals who have spent their lives elevating the cultural vibrancy of our nation and the world," said Kennedy Center Chairman David M. Rubenstein in a press release announcing the honors.

The Honors Gala, in which the honorees will be saluted by colleagues from the arts and entertainment, is scheduled for December 7. A broadcast of the event will air on CBS on December 30.
