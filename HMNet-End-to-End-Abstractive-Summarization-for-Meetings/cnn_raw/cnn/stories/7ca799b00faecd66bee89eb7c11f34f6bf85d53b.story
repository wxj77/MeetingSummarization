(CNN) -- Scuffles between Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi's presidential guard and Ugandan security personnel have twice broken out at the African Union summit on the shores of Lake Victoria, officials said.

"Fights are always a result of the lack of respect by the Libyans to their hosts," said Ejison Kwesiga, spokesman for Uganda's presidential brigade. "Host authorities are responsible for any dangers that could arise. It is the host country's authorities who must take care of all visiting heads of state, but the Libyans never want them to do their job."

Libyan guards exchanged kicks and blows with Ugandan security on Sunday, the first day of the summit, as they approached the entrance marquee for the opening ceremony, according to journalist Samson Ntale. Only heads of state were allowed inside the ceremony.

An argument erupted when Ugandan authorities attempted to escort Gadhafi through the entrance. "It escalated into a physical fight, but no guns were drawn," Ntale said.

On Monday, a similar situation occurred when Gadhafi and his security team were walking to the main conference hall. Heads of state were being moved to another room, and a scuffle broke out when Ugandan authorities attempted to escort Gadhafi there. Apparently annoyed the meeting was moved, Gadhafi slapped three of his own personnel, Ntale said. "Gadhafi was irritated. I saw him slap his own men," he said.

The Libyan security personnel declined comment.
