Rapper Tone Loc pleaded no contest Monday to domestic violence and other charges, about three and a half months after a fight with the mother of his child, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced.

Tone Loc, whose real name is Anthony Smith, entered the plea in open court of single counts of corporal injury to a spouse, cohabitant or child's parent and possession of an assault weapon, the office said in a press release. The weapon -- a Colt AR-15 Sporter -- was found by investigators, but was not used in the domestic assault.

There was no negotiated settlement, according to the district attorney.

After the rapper addressed the court, Burbank Superior Court Judge Patrick Hegarty sentenced him to one day in county jail, three years of probation, 52 weeks of anger management counseling and 30 days of community service.

He was arrested in June, following what Burbank Police Sgt. Tracy Sanchez then described as "a physical altercation with the mother of his child."

The entertainer then spent less than three hours in custody before posting a $50,000 bond, according to Sanchez.

The 45-year-old rapper rose to stardom in 1988 with his hit singles "Wild Thing" and "Funky Cold Medina."

His deep, raspy voice made him famous not just in the music world, but also helped him as he scored acting roles on television and doing voice work. He has been cast in several sitcoms and reality TV shows, according to the Internet Movie Database.
