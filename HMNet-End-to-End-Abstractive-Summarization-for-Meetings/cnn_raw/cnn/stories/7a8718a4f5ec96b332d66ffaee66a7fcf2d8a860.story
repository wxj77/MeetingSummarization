London (CNN) -- When it comes to building cutting-edge robots, it seems their designers have a tendency to create them in their own likeness.

These eerily life-like, and occasionally just eerie, robots are just some of the exhibits that went on display Thursday at the Robotville Festival at London's Science Museum.

From the Italian-built iCub, which learns by playing with people, to CHARLY, which is being used to help autistic children, these robots mimic humans in order to help them learn about people and communicate with them.

The exhibition doesn't just feature humanoid robots -- there are also robots that swim and ones that swarm, some that explore and others designed for domestic use.

It is being run in partnership with EUNIC and the European Commission Robotics program and ends on December 4.
