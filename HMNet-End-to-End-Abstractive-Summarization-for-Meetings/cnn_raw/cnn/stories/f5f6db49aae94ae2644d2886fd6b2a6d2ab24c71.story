(CNN)  -- The entire population of Taloga, Oklahoma, was evacuated Thursday because of a raging fire that has burned tens of thousands of acres, officials said Friday.

Wildfire threatens a house in Edmond, Oklahoma, on Friday.

All of the residents, about 400, left the Dewey County town, but have been allowed back in, said Bill Challis with the fire department in Clinton, Oklahoma, south of Taloga. Clinton is among dozens of fire departments helping battle the blaze.

Wildfires have been burning in northwest and central Oklahoma since Thursday, according to the state Department of Emergency Management.

A large wildfire also came within inches of homes north of Edmond late Friday morning and was still burning during the noon hour, CNN affiliate KOCO reported.

Oklahoma Department of Public Safey officials also report that one to two city blocks of Weleetka, in Okfuskee County, were on fire, according to KOCO.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency  has approved the state's request for federal assistance for  fighting the wildfire in Dewey County, where Taloga is located.

The original call about the Taloga fire came in Thursday at about 12:30 p.m. (1:30 p.m. ET), Challis said. Officials don't know how the fire started.

Brett Russell, also with the Clinton Fire Department, said about 60,000 acres have burned. There are no reports of anyone injured.

As of about 11 a.m. Friday (12 p.m. ET), the Taloga fire was about 50 to 60 percent contained. About 80 fire departments helping battle the blaze, Russell told CNN.

An Oklahoma Army National Guard Blackhawk helicopter was helping with aerial fire suppression, according to the state.
