(CNN) -- Kansas leaders Wednesday ended a standoff that had delayed tax refunds and state paychecks by agreeing to borrow $225 million from various state accounts, a spokeswoman for the governor's office said.

Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius approved $300 million in budget cuts Wednesday.

Republican lawmakers approved moving money into the state's main account to pay the bills after budget cuts agreed to by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, spokeswoman Brittany Stiffler said.

The state resumed processing income tax refunds on Wednesday -- they had been suspended last week because of low funds -- and state employees' paychecks will be paid on time Friday, Department of Administration spokesman Gavin Young said.

Republicans earlier this week denied the Democratic governor's request to move the money, saying they could not approve the certificate of indebtedness, also known as internal borrowing, until they knew the state could repay the money by June 30, the end of the fiscal year.

However, Republicans said they would be likely to approve the internal borrowing if Sebelius agreed to the Legislature's proposed budget cuts for the 2009 fiscal year. On Wednesday, she approved about $300 million in budget cuts.

"She blinked, and that's helpful," Senate Majority Leader Derek Schmidt, a Republican, said Wednesday.

"I'm just sorry we had to have high drama and worry a lot of Kansans about our ability to pay our obligations," Sebelius said Wednesday.

Kansas was one of several states to meet this week to address budget concerns in a time when 43 states are starting the year short on funds, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

"This is an equal-opportunity recession. States in virtually every part of the country are suffering... even the energy states are starting to report problems," Corina Eckl of the National Conference of State Legislatures said. iReport.com: What you'd fix first

"For most, it has only gone downhill. They have tried to make up the difference with expanded gambling, with delays of construction projects, with hiring freezes, with fee and tax increases. But almost all of this has failed to regain lost ground, merely serving as a firebreak against worse troubles," she said.

California faces a $42 billion deficit that prompted Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to declare a fiscal emergency in December. California lawmakers worked into early Wednesday but couldn't pass a budget.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued 10,000 layoff notices Tuesday, affecting a wide spectrum of state agencies and employees, in an effort to deal with the budget crisis, a spokesman said.

Another 10,000 layoff notices might be sent Wednesday, the spokesman said. All the layoffs would take effect July 1, the start of the new fiscal year.

The Republican governor has butted heads for months with the Democratic majority over easing the $11.2 billion revenue shortfall this fiscal year alone. Cuts would save California $750 million for the year. The $42 billion deficit is for the current and next fiscal years. Interactive: See projected state budget gaps »

"It's drastic, but we're in a drastic situation," Rep. Steve King, R-Grand Junction, told KUSA.

In Washington state, proposed budget cuts have led to protests in the capital, Olympia, KOMO-TV in Seattle reported.

State employees said they want fair pay, better benefits and pensions and no layoffs.
