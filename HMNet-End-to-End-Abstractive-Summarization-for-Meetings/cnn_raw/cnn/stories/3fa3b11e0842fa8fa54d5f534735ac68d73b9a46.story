(CNN) -- David Letterman will remain on late-night TV at least through 2015, CBS announced Friday.

Letterman characteristically cracked wise about his new deal with CBS President and CEO Les Moonves.

"Les and I had a lengthy discussion, and we both agreed that I needed a little more time to fully run the show into the ground," Letterman said in a CBS news release.

Letterman debuted his late-night show on NBC on February 1, 1982, making comical top 10 lists and "stupid pet tricks" part of pop culture.

He moved to CBS and "The Late Show with David Letterman" on Aug 30, 1993.
