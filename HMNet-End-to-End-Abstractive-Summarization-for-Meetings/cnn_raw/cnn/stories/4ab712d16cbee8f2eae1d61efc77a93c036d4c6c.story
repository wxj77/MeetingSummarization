(EW.com) -- Rebel Wilson will emcee the 2013 MTV Movie Awards, the network announced Thursday in a "first look" trailer that aired during the "Jersey Shore" finale.

Set to air on April 14, this is the "Pitch Perfect" star's first time hosting, and the first time a woman has hosted since Sarah Silverman's stint in 2007.

On top of the delightful news that Amy Poehler and Tina Fey are hosting the Golden Globes this year, we're hoping the female comedian-as-host trend continues.

Take a look at the trailer, featuring Wilson herself, here.

After her over-the-top roles in "Bridesmaids" and "Pitch Perfect," we can't wait to see her signature comedy style on the annual awards show.

In the show's 20 year history, the hosts have been inconsistent. Remember Jessica Alba in 2006? Lindsay Lohan even hosted one year â€” but her one-off hosting gig in 2004 was during a more innocent time for the troubled starlet.

Since 2007, single comedian hosts have reclaimed the show, including Andy Samberg, Aziz Ansari, Jason Sudeikis, and Russell Brand. When it comes to keeping an awards show amusing, comedians generally have the advantage over actors.

Mindy Kaling for 2014? Just a thought.
