(CNN) -- It is the scariest diagnosis imaginable. So terrifying, it seems, that many people with early signs of Alzheimer's disease dwell for years in a state of denial.

Sandy Halperin, who was diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's at age 60, is trying to change that. He's allowing CNN to follow him and his family as he faces his diagnosis bravely.

See the first chapter of his story here: http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2014/09/health/sandys-story/

Then join Sandy, Ruth Drew, director of family and information services for the Alzheimer's Association, and CNN producer Stephanie Smith in the comments section on this page for a discussion on Tuesday, September 23 from 3 to 4 p.m. ET.

The comments section will open a few minutes before 3 p.m. and will remain open for an hour.
