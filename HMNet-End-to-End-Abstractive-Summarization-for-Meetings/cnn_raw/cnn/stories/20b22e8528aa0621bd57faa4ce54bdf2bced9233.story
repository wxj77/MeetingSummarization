(CNN) -- Tiger Woods suffered a fresh injury setback Sunday after he was forced to pull out of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in Akron, Ohio, midway through the final round.

Woods appeared to jar his back playing an awkward shot out of the bunker on the second hole.

Evidently in some pain, Woods' round deteriorated as he found both a pond and the trees before eventually deciding he couldn't continue six holes later. By then he was four shots over par for the tournament.

He was later seen struggling to get his shoes off, calling into question whether he will be fit for next week's PGA Championship and the up and coming Ryder Cup.

"I just jarred it, and it's been spasming ever since," he told the PGA's official website.

"It's just the whole lower back."

Woods had only just recently returned to competitive action after taking three months out to have microdiscetomy surgery. The WGC-Bridgestone Invitational was his third tournament since the procedure, which was needed after Woods had struggled with the pain for close to two years.

"I don't know," Woods replied when asked whether he would be fit for the PGA Championship. "Just trying to get out of here."
