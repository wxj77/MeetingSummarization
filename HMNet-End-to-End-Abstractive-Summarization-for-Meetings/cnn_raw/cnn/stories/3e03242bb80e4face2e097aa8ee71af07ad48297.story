(CNN) -- At least 30 Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia were killed in a joint raid by Kenyan and Somali forces Saturday, officials said.

The operation targeted an Al-Shabaab hideout in Kolbio, Somalia, Col. Cyrus Oguna of the Kenyan Defense Force said.

The al Qaeda-linked Islamist group has been connected to the attack in Nairobi's Westgate mall last month where 67 people were killed.

Saturday's raid follows another operation earlier in the week, where Kenyan warplanes targeted a militant training camp inside Somalia.

Kenyan officials say the terror group has used camps to train operatives, including attackers who targeted Westgate mall.
