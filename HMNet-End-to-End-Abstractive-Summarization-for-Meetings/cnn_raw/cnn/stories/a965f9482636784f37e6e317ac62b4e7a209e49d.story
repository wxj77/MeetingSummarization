(CNN)Cameron Diaz kicked off her new year with the sound of wedding bells.

According to reports, the actress married Good Charlotte musician Benji Madden in a small ceremony at the couple's home in Los Angeles.

Diaz, 42, had been dating Madden, 35, since May. The couple became engaged in December and are said to have sealed the deal the evening of January 5. The guest list reportedly included celebrities like Reese Witherspoon and Gwyneth Paltrow, with Diaz's friend Drew Barrymore serving as a bridesmaid.

Diaz - who has previously been linked to actor Jared Leto, singer Justin Timberlake and baseball player Alex Rodriguez - has been skeptical in the past of marriage and outspoken about the fact that she wasn't anxious to settle down.

She told Maxim magazine in 2011 that she believed marriage was a "dying institution," adding, "I think we have to make our own rules. I don't think we should live our lives in relationships based off old traditions that don't suit our world any longer."

But it seems Benji Madden suits the actress just fine. Diaz's friend and Madden's sister-in-law, Nicole Richie, has previously (and perhaps jokingly) taken credit for setting the pair up.

"I approve of anything that's going to make Benj happy," Richie, who's married to Madden's twin brother, Joel, told Andy Cohen on "Watch What Happens Live" in July. "I am a devoted sister-in-law. I am happy for anybody who's happy, and I want everybody to be surrounded with love."

If Richie did play matchmaker for Diaz and Madden, she nailed it. In a statement to People magazine the newlyweds said, "We couldn't be happier to begin our new journey together surrounded by our closest family and friends."
