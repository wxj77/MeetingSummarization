(CNN) -- Hollywood and the Kennedy family came together Saturday with the marriage of Robert Kennedy Jr. to actress Cheryl Hines.

The two wed at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, which captured the nation's attention more than 50 years ago during the presidency of John F. Kennedy.

"They have wed, and it was beautiful," Hines publicist Ann Gurrola said.

Robert Kennedy Jr. is the late president's nephew and the son of former attorney general and U.S. Sen. Robert Kennedy. The brothers were assassinated during the 1960s.

The marriage is the third for Robert Kennedy Jr. In 2012, his then-estranged wife Mary Kennedy died of asphyxiation due to hanging in Bedford, New York. Mary and Robert Kennedy had four children together. Robert Kennedy has two children from an earlier marriage.

Kennedy, 60, is an environmental lawyer and activist.

His new wife is widely recognized in Hollywood, most of all from her years playing Larry David's wife on the former celebrated HBO show, "Curb Your Enthusiasm."

Besides that work, the Florida-born Hines, 48, has appeared as a regular on the TV series "Suburgatory," "We Need Help" and other shows.

CNN's Matthew Carey contributed to this report.
