(CNN) -- Real Madrid restored their six-point lead at the top of Spain's La Liga with a 5-1 thrashing of Real Sociedad Saturday.

Real were held 1-1 at Villarreal in midweek but in their own Santiago Bernabeu stadium were back to winning ways.

Gonzalo Higuain put Los Blancos ahead early in the first half before two goals apiece from Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema completed the rout.

Ronaldo's double left him level with Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi on 35 league goals as the superstar pair match each other goal for goal to maintain their incredible scoring rates.

Xavi Prieto was on target late on for the well beaten visitors.

Barcelona had earlier briefly cut Real's lead to just three points after Messi and Gerard Pique scored in a 2-0 win at Mallorca.

The victory came despite the reigning champions having to play the last half hour with only 10 men after Thiago Alcantara was shown red.

Messi, who became Barcelona's all-time leading scorer in midweek, got on the scoresheet in the first half.

Alexis Sanchez was originally credited with the goal from Messi's free kick but it was discovered he did not get a touch.

Thiago's dismissal for a second yellow left Barca on the back foot, but when Messi's late shot hit the post, central defender Pique was the first to react to grab the clinching second.
