(CNN) -- Ferrari's Fernando Alonso has said the Italian team have a "moral obligation" to keep fighting for the 2011 Formula One world championship until the end of the season.

The Spaniard Alonso sits fourth in the drivers' standings, 89 points behind current leader and reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel.

Red Bull driver Vettel has finished in the top-two in 10 of the season's opening 11 races, but two-time world champion Alonso has vowed to give his all in the year's remaining eight rounds in an attempt to catch the German.

"We must try and win as many races as possible," the 30-year-old told Ferrari's official website. "We are realistic and the championship situation is what it is, but we have seen so often that there can be sudden reversals.

"And after all, we are Ferrari and we have a moral obligation, especially for the millions of fans spread around the world, to always think of the maximum goal."

Alonso has picked up only one race win in 2011, at July's British Grand Prix, but he has set his sights on an improved run of form when the sport returns from its mid-season break in Belgium later this month.

"Of course we must start winning and we have to hope that Vettel makes a few mistakes or has some problems.

"In Spa [the home of the Belgian Grand Prix] I have never won in Formula One and it would be nice to do that, then comes Monza which is special and I would like to feel again the amazing feeling I got from it last year."

Alonso made his debut in the elite division on motorsport with Minardi in 2001 and went on to win the world championship with Renault in 2005 and 2006.

The Belgian Grand Prix is set to take place at the Spa circuit on August 28.
