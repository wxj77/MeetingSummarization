(CNN)Chelsea underlined its title credentials with an attacking masterclass against Swansea, Saturday.

The London club moved five points clear at the top of the English Premier League table with a 5-0 victory at the Liberty Stadium.

With less than a minute on the clock, Oscar fired the table toppers into the lead to ignite the goal rush.

Diego Costa -- the leading scorer in the EPL with 17 goals -- added two more before Oscar bagged his second just before halftime.

After goals galore there was only a single strike from Andre Schurrle to savor after the break. The German winger came off the bench to make it five for Chelsea.

"The result is impressive," manager Jose Mourinho told Chelsea TV. "The performance was very good, very solid and very enjoyable."

The free flowing display by Mourinho's men was a warning to those threatening to deny Chelsea its first title since 2010.
