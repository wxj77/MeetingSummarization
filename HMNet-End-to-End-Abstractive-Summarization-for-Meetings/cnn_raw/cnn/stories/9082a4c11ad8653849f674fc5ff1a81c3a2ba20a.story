Washington (CNN) -- They are already lining up outside the U.S. Supreme Court for public seating at next week's oral arguments on same-sex marriage.

People arrived on Thursday night when temperatures in the capital dipped into the 30s and had grown to about a half-dozen people by Friday afternoon.

Those assembled at the base of the high court plaza were bundled in heavy coats and sitting in portable chairs.

Groups will be allowed into the Supreme Court starting on Tuesday ahead of 10 a.m. ET arguments on California's voter-approved ban on gay marriage known as Proposition 8.

A separate challenge to the federal law known as the Defense of Marriage Act will be argued Wednesday.

There are about 250 seats for the general public for each.

High-profile cases typically attract lines early on. Some are spectators, while others are place-holders for big law firms or advocacy groups.

Last year, spectators also lined up the weekend before the Supreme Court heard arguments on the health care reform law.

Two lines eventually form out front of the court's marble exterior, one for those who want to watch an entire argument and the other for those seeking a glimpse of the proceedings.
