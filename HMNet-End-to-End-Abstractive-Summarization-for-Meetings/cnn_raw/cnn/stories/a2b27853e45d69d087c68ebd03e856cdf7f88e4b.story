Los Angeles (CNN) -- A private jet carrying Chris Brown made an emergency landing in Burbank, California, Monday after smoke filled the cockpit, the singer's representative confirmed Tuesday.

The incident, first reported by TMZ, happened as Brown was on his way from Los Angeles to New York to attend Monday night's Met Gala event.

The Gulfstream jet quickly returned to the Burbank airport when passengers and crew noticed the smoke just minutes after take off, TMZ reported.

Brown resumed his trip without incident on another jet later, but missed the event, TMZ reported. He did attend an after-party, it said.

CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.
