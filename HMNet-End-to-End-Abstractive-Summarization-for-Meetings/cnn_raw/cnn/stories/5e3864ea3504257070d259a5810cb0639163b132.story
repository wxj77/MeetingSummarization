(CNN) -- The English Premier League (EPL) have confirmed they will vehemently oppose a new move by a supporters' association to bring back standing at football matches.

Following the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death on terracing, it was made law in England for all top-flight stadiums to be made all-seater -- although terraces are still common place in the lower divisions.

However, many supporters believe that the banning of standing up at football grounds has resulted in the atmosphere becoming diluted -- prompting the  180,000-member Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) to launch an online petition calling for the return of standing areas in the top division.

Speaking to the official English Premier League website, EPL spokesman Dan Johnson said: "Our view is that the benefits of all-seater stadia far outweigh the return of standing areas.

"They have led to more women and children attending the games and, no matter how safe standiing can be made, seating is always safer. We will not be encouraging the Government to change the law," he added.

The FSF held a meeting on Monday with representatives from the police, the Government and footballing authorities, with their chairman Malcolm Clarke arguing that many fans still stand up despite having a seat.

However, British Sport's Minister Hugh Robertson told the meeting: "Should we return to terracing, then the first time there is any significant crowd trouble, or an accident, the minister's head would be on a spike at Tower Bridge before he could draft a resignation letter!"

The FSF has cited the German Bundesliga, where terraces are widespread, resulting in packed stadia and cheaper tickets, as a good example of how standing can be safer at matches.

Standing is also still very much evident in Argentina and Brazil, where the most fervent supporters adorn their own respective terraces in club colours, making for a noisy, passionate, and at times, intimidating atmosphere.
