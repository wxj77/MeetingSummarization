(CNN)It's no secret that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has a young, liberal fanbase that shows its devotion in distinctly millennial ways.

Her positions on wage parity, same-sex marriage and women's rights (to name a few) have earned her the nickname "The Notorious R.B.G." thanks to a Tumblr of the same name dedicated to her. There are tattoos, muscle tees and YouTube serenades paying homage to the soft-spoken justice, who has been on the nation's highest bench for 21 years -- longer than some of her followers have been alive.

So it seems appropriate that her fans would celebrate her 82nd with social media memes, the Internet's favorite tool for honoring/mocking public figures. Here are some of the tributes wishing Justice Ginsburg a #NotoriousBday.
