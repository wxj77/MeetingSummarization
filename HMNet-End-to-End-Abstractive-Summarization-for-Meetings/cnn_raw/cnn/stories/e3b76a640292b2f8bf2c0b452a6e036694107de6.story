(CNN) -- Formula One is taking another step in its techno evolution this year, with major rule changes meaning that the season could be more unpredictable than it has been for a long time.

Sebastian Vettel's hopes of a fifth consecutive world drivers' title appear very much in the balance, with his previously all-conquering Red Bull team struggling for reliability during preseason testing.

However, the sign of a true champion is the ability to cope with change and innovate accordingly -- something the Austrian marque has done better than any other in recent seasons.
