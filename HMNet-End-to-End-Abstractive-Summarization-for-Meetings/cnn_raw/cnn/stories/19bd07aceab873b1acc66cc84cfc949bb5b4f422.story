(CNN Student News) -- October 6, 2014

First up this Monday, we cover the latest jobs numbers from the U.S. government, the significance of the report, and how Democrats and Republicans are characterizing it. We also look into three recent tragedies involving high school football players. And we report on what could be the first U.S. military casualty in the war against ISIS. Sports history and brain science also factor in to today's show.
