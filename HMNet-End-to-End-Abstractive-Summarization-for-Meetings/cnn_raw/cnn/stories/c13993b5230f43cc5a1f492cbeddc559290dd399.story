(CNN) -- Halle Berry is talking about becoming a mother for the second time at 46.

"I feel fantastic. This has been the biggest surprise of my life to tell you the truth," said Berry in an interview with CNN's Alina Cho. In the interview, Berry spoke about her work with designer Michael Kors and the U.N. World Food Programme to fight hunger.

The Academy Award-winning actress and fiance Olivier Martinez are expecting their first child together.

"I thought I was kind of past the point where this could be a reality for me. So it's been a big surprise and the most wonderful," the actress said.

In the interview with CNN's Alina Cho, Berry said she did not know if she was having boy, as some other media outlets have reported.

Berry has been engaged to Martinez, 47, a French actor, for more than a year.

Berry also has a daughter, Nahla, 5, with her ex-boyfriend, Canadian model Gabriel Aubry. Berry waged a difficult custody battle with Aubry when she wanted to move with Nahla to France. The estranged couple reached a settlement in November.
