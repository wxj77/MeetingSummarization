(CNN) -- Former "Jersey Shore" star Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino was charged with simple assault after a fight in a tanning salon he co-owns with his brother.

Video captured by Splash News showed a smiling Sorrentino walking out of the Middletown, New Jersey, police station after posting a $500 bond Tuesday afternoon. His right eye appeared bruised and scratches were visible on his neck.

The Situation told the photographer that the fight happened because his brother "was not running the store correctly, so I had to go in there and clean house, in more ways than one."

Sorrentino, 31, was the only person charged in the fight, according to Police Lt. Stephen Dollinger.

The Situation: I'm not the same person I was before

Sorrentino, who appeared in six seasons of the MTV reality series "Jersey Shore," emerged from a stint in drug rehab two years ago declaring that he was a changed man.

"Mike today? I wake every day these days with a smile," he said at the time. "Happy to be alive. Happy to have the family that I have. Happy to have the fans that I have, the friends. Happy to be involved in the show ... almost like a smell-the-roses moment. ... I know where I am and I know where I'm gonna be and that's all that counts."
