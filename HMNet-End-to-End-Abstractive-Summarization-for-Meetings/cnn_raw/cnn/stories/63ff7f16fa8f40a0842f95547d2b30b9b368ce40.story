(CNN) -- A body found in a wooded area Tuesday is believed to be that of 11-year-old William McQuain, who went missing more than two weeks ago, Montgomery County, Maryland, police said.

Search dog handlers found the body of a young African-American male in Clarksburg, Maryland, just after 9 a.m. Tuesday, police said in a statement.

The scene was still being processed Tuesday morning, and police spokeswoman Rebecca Innocenti had no information on when a positive identification would be made.

An Amber Alert was issued for the boy after his mother, Jane McQuain, 51, was found dead in the bedroom of her Germantown home October 12. She had been stabbed and beaten, according to police.

Her son was not there, and her Honda CRV was gone, but police later recovered it.

Police said the boy was last seen September 30 at his home. Authorities said Jane McQuain had been dead for about 10 to 12 days when her body was found. The discovery was made after a friend contacted police and said he had not been able to contact her and was concerned.

Curtis Lopez, 45, was arrested last week in Charlotte, North Carolina, in connection with Jane McQuain's death. He waived extradition to Maryland on Monday. Police said Lopez was McQuain's husband and was often at her residence, although he did not appear to live there. Witnesses reported seeing him loading items into McQuain's vehicle recently, police said.

Authorities obtained a surveillance tape from the morning of October 1 showing Lopez "entering and re-entering" a storage unit in Germantown with the boy, the police statement said. "At that time, William McQuain appeared to be in a playful mood and showed no signs of distress."

"The clothing that William McQuain was wearing in the video is similar to the clothing found on the body that was located," the statement said. The body is believed to have been in its location since October 1, authorities said.
