(CNN Student News) -- September 3, 2013

As a new week begins, CNN Student News reports on the U.S. approach to Syria, radiation levels in Japan, and the discovery of a canyon under the ice in Greenland. We also discuss the power of perseverance as Diana Nyad completes a quest she began 35 years ago. And we consider a change happening in some U.S. school cafeterias.
