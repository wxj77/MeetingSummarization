(CNN) -- Gills Onions recalled 2,360 pounds of diced red onions because of possible listeria contamination, the California-based company said Saturday.

The recalled onions were distributed to retailers in Canada and retailers and distributors in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Idaho, Texas, Illinois, Michigan, Arkansas, Ohio, Tennessee, New Jersey, Georgia and Florida.

The product is beyond its use-by dates -- May 14, 15 and 17 -- and no illnesses and have been reported, the company said. It advised consumers to toss whatever recalled onions they might still have in the trash.

Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. It is rarely found in healthy people. However, it can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea.

In extreme cases, listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths, as well as serious and sometimes fatal infections, especially in people with poor immune systems.

The voluntary recall was initiated after a routine and random test directed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Gills Onions said.

The recalled product sold at retail was in a clear, 7-ounce container, while the product sold to distributors was in a clear, 5-pound plastic bag, the company said.
