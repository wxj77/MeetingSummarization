(CNN) -- Watching Sunday's long, sometimes awkward Academy Awards broadcast was made more entertaining by the steady stream of commentary on Twitter.

There were 6.8 million tweets during the event, 2.1 million tweets during the red carpet pre-shows, according to Twitter. The most Tweeted about moment was the Best Picture win for "Argo." It clocked in at 85,300 Tweets per minute, almost keeping pace with the number of words per minute in Ben Affleck's acceptance speech.

There were more musical numbers than usual in the show, and the highlights of the evening were Shirley Bassey, Jennifer Hudson and Adele. Twitter loved Adele: her performance of "Skyfall" was the second most popular moment on the social network, and her win for Best Original song was fourth. Other highly Tweeted moments included Jennifer Lawrence's win for Best Actress (and endearing stumble on the way to accept the award), and Anne Hathaway's win for Best Actress in a Supporting role.

Google also tracked the spikes in search traffic throughout the evening. When William Shatner emerged as Captain James T. Kirk, searches for the word "kirk" hit 1,500 a minute. Other jumps included searches for "tie" the after the tie for Best Sound Editing was announced, and searches for "michelle obama" when the first lady made a special appearance from the White House to help present the Best Picture.

Here are some of the other big moments of the night, as narrated by Twitter's army of amateur Tom Servos.
