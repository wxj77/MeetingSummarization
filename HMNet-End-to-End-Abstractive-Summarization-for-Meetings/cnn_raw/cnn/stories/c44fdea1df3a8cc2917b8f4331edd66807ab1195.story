If you're planning to stay home New Year's Day and stream classic movies on Netflix, you may be out of luck.

More than 80 movies and a handful of TV shows -- including "Titanic," "Top Gun" and some seasons of "Saturday Night Live" -- will no longer be available for streaming through the site as of Wednesday, according to a post on Reddit.

It was not clear who posted the list, but a search on Netflix for many of the titles reveals that they will indeed expire Wednesday for Netflix's nearly 40 million streaming subscribers. The company's DVD customers -- it has about 7 million in the U.S. -- may still order the discs in the mail.

A spokesperson for Netflix told CNN that the company routinely adds and deletes titles from its streaming service due to licensing contracts.

The list of streaming movies due to expire includes such favorites as "Being John Malkovich," "Braveheart," "Do the Right Thing," "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," "Flashdance,"  "Roman Holiday," "Platoon" and "War Games."

(It also includes "Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo" and "Killer Klowns From Outer Space.")

Among the TV shows being purged from Netflix's streaming menu: the original "Dark Shadows," "Mr Bean" and "The Kids in the Hall."

A number of new titles also will become available for streaming on Netflix at or near the first of the year, including "Jack Reacher," "The Talented Mr. Ripley," "Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters" and seasons 5-8 of "Dexter," the spokesperson said.

On Monday, Netflix also began offering some new members a single-device streaming plan for $6.99 a month -- a dollar less than its current two-screen streaming option.
