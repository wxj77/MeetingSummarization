Bill Cosby's family is rallying around the embattled comedian.

On Monday, Cosby's wife, Camille, released a statement in defense of her husband, who has been accused of sexual assault by a number of women. On Tuesday, his daughter Evin sent a statement to "Access Hollywood" standing up for Cosby.

"He is the FATHER you thought you knew. 'The Cosby Show' was my today's tv reality show," she wrote. "Thank you. That's all I would like to say :)."

On a Facebook page reputed to belong to Evin Cosby, posts cheered her mother and questioned the accusers. CNN has not confirmed the page belongs to Evin Cosby.

Over the last month, many women have come forward to accuse Cosby of past sexual assault;  the star has never been charged.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said Tuesday it won't be charging Cosby with a crime in one of the alleged incidents that's emerged in the past month: the case of Judy Huth, a woman who recently sued Cosby, claiming he sexually molested her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974, when she was 15 years old.

The statute of limitations for any possible misdemeanor or felony charge in the case has run out, the office said.

Even without any charges filed, the accusations have caused Cosby's public persona to be damaged, resulting in lost projects and tour dates.

How will we remember Bill Cosby?

His camp has repeatedly and vigorously denied the allegations.

It defies common sense that "so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years," said Cosby's attorney, Martin D. Singer, in a written statement sent to CNN.

Cosby has said little, though Friday he told a freelance New York Post reporter that he appreciates his wife's strength, and offered expectations on how the media should cover the story.
