(EW.com ) -- Showtime is sharing a few pieces of intel about "Homeland:" Two new roles have been cast for the upcoming fourth season.

Corey Stoll â€” who earned a Golden Globe nomination for his role on "House of Cards" and whose credits include "The Normal Heart" and "Midnight in Paris" â€” will guest-star as Sandy Bachman, the CIA chief of station in Pakistan who's a rising star within the agency. The number of episodes Stoll will appear in is being kept under wraps.

Martha is described as "professional and put together, with a ship-to-ship voice and the personality to match." Robins, who appeared in multiple episodes of "Bored to Death," "Law & Order," and "The Sopranos," also starred in the big-screen comedy "Planes, Trains, & Automobiles."
