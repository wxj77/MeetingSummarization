Baghdad (CNN) -- The widow of an al Qaeda in Iraq leader has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, after being convicted of involvement in terrorism.

Hasna Ali was the wife of Abu Ayyub al-Masri, one of the two top leaders of al Qaeda in Iraq who were killed in a joint Iraqi-U.S. operation in April 2010. Al-Masri was military leader of al Qaeda in Iraq.

Iraqi Supreme Judicial Council spokesman Abdul Sattar al-Berqdar told CNN Sunday that Hasna Ali, who is from Yemen, was sentenced in an Iraqi court.

Abu Ayyub al-Masri was the military leader of al Qaeda in Iraq. He was killed along with Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, who was

leader of the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq.

When they were killed more than a year ago, then-commander of U.S. Forces-Iraq Gen. Raymond Odierno called it "potentially the most significant blow to al Qaeda in Iraq since the beginning of the insurgency."

Journalists Fattah Mahmood Fattah and Muhaimen Najm contributed to this report.
