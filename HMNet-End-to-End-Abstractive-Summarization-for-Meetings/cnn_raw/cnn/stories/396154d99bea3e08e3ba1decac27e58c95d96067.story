(CNN) -- Vin Diesel, can you be a little more "inhumanly" obvious?

The actor may be yanking the Internet's collective chain, or perhaps he's just trying to stroke negotiations. Either way, his Facebook page features a photo post that hints about involvement in Marvel's forthcoming "Inhumans" movie -- and has the Web buzzing.

"I Think Vin Diesel May Just Be In The Inhumans Movie," read a headline on io9.com.

The Facebook picture features Diesel wearing an "Inhumans" T-shirt, standing in front of a graphic reading, "Are you Inhuman?"

It's no sure thing, of course.

He already has a part in the Marvel universe, that of Groot, the laconic tree-like entity from "Guardians of the Galaxy," and Marvel doesn't like actors to play more than one role.

But Groot is computer-generated, and Black Bolt, the "Inhumans" part Diesel is rumored to play, barely speaks. (With good reason: His voice can demolish whole cities.)

Diesel as Black Bolt, the leader of the Inhumans, would please a chunk of fanboys. There's already a YouTube-posted trailer with Diesel in the role.

Either way, there's plenty of time for Diesel to play and fans to chew on his post. The "Inhumans" movie isn't due out until November 2018, according to the Marvel calendar.
