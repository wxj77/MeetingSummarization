Los Angeles (CNN) -- "Desperate Housewives" star Eva Longoria's divorce from NBA star Tony Parker was finalized by a Texas court, according to her publicist.

Anderson Group Public Relations issued a short statement confirming the divorce Monday.

The couple filed for divorce in November after reports surfaced that she found evidence he was cheating with the wife of a fellow San Antonio Spurs player. She filed in Los Angeles and he filed in Bexar County, Texas.

"It is with great sadness that after seven years together, Eva and I have decided to divorce," Parker said in a statement at the time. "We love each other deeply and pray for each other's happiness."

Longoria issued a similarly worded statement a day later.
