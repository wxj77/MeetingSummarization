For the first time, Britain has convicted someone of a terrorism offense related to the Syrian civil war.

Mashudur Choudhury, 31, was convicted of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist attacks, the Crown Prosecution Service said.

A father of two, Choudhury traveled to Syria in October with the intention of joining a terrorist training camp, the UK's Press Association reported.

"At times in his discussions with others the defendant described his intention to become a martyr," prosecutor Alison Morgan told the jury during the two-week trial, the association reported.

In one text message, his wife wrote him, "Go die in battlefield. Go die, I really mean it just go. I'll be relieved. At last. At last," the Press Association said.

Choudhury pleaded not guilty.

He will be sentenced June 13.
