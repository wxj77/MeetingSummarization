KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Monsoon flooding has left 50,000 people homeless in Nepal and killed at least 74 people in northern India, according to officials.

Monsoon rain has bought heavy flooding to southern Nepal, pictured, and northern India.

The Nepalese army Thursday used helicopters to rescue residents in southeastern Nepal who were stranded on treetops and roofs after monsoon flooding forced more than 50,000 people from their homes.

In northern India monsoon flooding destroyed mud huts and killed at least 74 people, officials said. The deaths were in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

The latest casualties bring to more than 300 the number of people killed in India since the start of this year's monsoon season.

Nepalese officials said at least four southern villages were inundated with water after the embankment on the Saptakoshi River burst Monday.

Some 40,000 people were now living in government-run relief camps; others had gone to other villages to stay with relatives, authorities said.

Nepalese Home Ministry officials said there were unconfirmed reports of deaths related to the flooding but authorities could not reach the affected areas to verify those reports.

Police and army troops had been using elephants, boats and helicopters to rescue stranded villagers in Sunsari district, about 400 km (249 miles) southeast of Kathmandu, since Monday.

Nepal amd India are in the midst of the annual monsoon season.
