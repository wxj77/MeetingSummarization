Washington (CNN) -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued a voluntary recall of a craft kit to create a foam pumpkin turkey following concerns the magnets included with the seasonal adult product could pose a hazard if ingested by small children.

No injuries have been reported.

About 1,800 kits, manufactured in China, were sold exclusively by Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores, based in Hudson, Ohio, between August and October of this year. They sell for about $8.

Consumers can return the item for a full refund.

The product safety commission said in a release, "Magnets holding the pumpkin shell pieces together can become loose, posing an ingestion hazard to young children." The magnets can link together inside a child's intestines, "causing intestinal obstructions, perforations, sepsis and death."

When assembled, the product resembles a turkey with a pumpkin-shaped body. The kit comes with various foam pieces to decorate the outer pumpkin shell and six small magnets that hold it together.
