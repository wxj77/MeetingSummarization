Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Two people on motorcycles shot and wounded a Pakistani diplomatic official in Kathmandu, Nepal, on Thursday morning, authorities said.

Mehboob Asif, a visa assistant at the Pakistan embassy, was hit by eight to 10 bullets while he was riding a motorcycle to work, according to police.

A Pakistan embassy official who did not want to be named said Asif was taken to the hospital and is now out of danger. He said authorities didn't know a motive for the attack.

"The Embassy of Pakistan is confident that the Government of Nepal would undertake investigations at appropriate levels to bring the criminals to justice," Pakistan's Embassy said in a statement.

Although no arrests have been made, around 150 people have been rounded up for questioning, Kathmandu police chief Pushkar Karki said.

The attack happened three days after a newly-appointed Minister for Energy Gokarna Bista was attacked with knives by two persons on motorcycles on Monday evening.
