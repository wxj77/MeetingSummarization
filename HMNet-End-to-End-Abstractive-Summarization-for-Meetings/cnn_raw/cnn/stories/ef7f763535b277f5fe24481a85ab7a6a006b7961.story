(CNN) -- At least one person was killed as a 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck Monday morning in southern Mexico's Chiapas state near the border with Guatemala, authorities in Chiapas said.

The quake happened at 6:23 a.m. (7:23 a.m. ET), about 1 mile from Puerto Madero, Mexico, which is on the country's Pacific coast.

Strong shaking was felt in southern Chiapas state and western Guatemala, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

In the Chiapas town of Huixtla, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) to the north of the epicenter, a person died after a wall fell on him, Chiapas' state civil protection system said on Twitter on Monday.

The quake damaged part of an airport in Tapachula, a Mexican city of about 300,000 people near the Guatemala border. Lights hung precariously by wires, and debris littered a floor, pictures that the city government posted to Twitter show.

The epicenter was about 127 miles (204 kilometers) west of Guatemala's capital, Guatemala City.

The depth of the quake was 37 miles, the USGS said. The USGS initially said the magnitude was 7.1.
