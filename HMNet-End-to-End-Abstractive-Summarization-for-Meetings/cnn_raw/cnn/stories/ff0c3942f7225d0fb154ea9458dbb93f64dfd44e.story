(EW.com) -- How did the makers of "I Don't Know How She Does It" not know that there are two insurmountable problems with their bogus chick flick about the amusing travails of a working mother?

The first is that the movie is based on a 2002 novel by British journalist Allison Pearson, and we live in 2011. True, Kate Reddy (Sarah Jessica Parker) is now an "investment manager" in Boston rather than a British hedge-fund shark.

Otherwise, Kate.2011 has the same accessories as Kate.2002, including a cute architect husband (Greg Kinnear), two kids who push Mommy's guilt buttons, and various male associates oblivious to commonplace 2011 workforce realities.

Into this time warp screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna ("Morning Glory," "27 Dresses") adds gratuitously bitchy stay-at-home gym-rat mothers and a boss (Kelsey Grammer) who blanches at the word mammogram. Pierce Brosnan plays a fairy-tale New York businessman as princely as he is single.

The second insurmountable problem is the difference between Parker's performance as a fortysomething banker, wife, and mother musing (in voice-over) at her computer and her previous performance as a single, thirtysomething girl-about-town in "Sex and the City": There is none. I don't know why she does it.

EW.com rating: D+
