Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban declared Friday they will target the weddings and funerals of anyone involved in pro-government activity against them.

The threat came as the Taliban claimed responsibility for Thursday's suicide blast targeting a funeral procession for a member of an anti-Taliban militia.

"Anyone who supports the U.S. and Pakistani military will face the same fate," Taliban spokesman Siraj-ud Din said. "We will target funeral processions and wedding ceremonies of those who support the U.S."

Din said Friday that the deceased and his attendants were enemies of Taliban because of their pro-government activity.

Police say a suicide bomber blew himself up standing in a funeral procession in the northwestern Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Saleem Murrawat, the police chief of the province's Lower Dir district, told CNN that the explosion killed 40 people and injured 67 others.
