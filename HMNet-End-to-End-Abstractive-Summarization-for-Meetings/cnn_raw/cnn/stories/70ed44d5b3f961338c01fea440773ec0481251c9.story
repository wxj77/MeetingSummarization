(CNN) -- This month, Inside the Middle East journeys to Israel and the Palestinian Territories. Host Leone Lakhani strolls along the ramparts of the wall surrounding the old city of Jerusalem, a place of enormous spiritual and cultural significance for Jews, Christians and Muslims alike.

Millions of tourists visit Jerusalem each year, but for some, the experience triggers overwhelming emotions - that could even land you in a hospital.

Next door, in the West Bank, some Palestinians are living the high life in Ramallah. The city has experienced a recent boom of five-star restaurants, cafes, and even hip nightclubs.

But much of it was financed on credit, and with the economy struggling throughout the occupied territories, many Palestinians are now starting to wonder when the bubble will burst.

In Tel Aviv, we meet Daphni Leef, a young Israeli activist whose calls for social justice led to the largest protest in the country's history. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in 2011, demanding economic change.

This year, however, Leef and other activists are struggling to rekindle the mood that led to those demonstrations - despite rising inflation and increased taxes.

Finally, we meet an Israeli woman of Iranian descent who is trying to bridge the growing political divide between Israel and Iran. Rita Yahan-Farouz is a 50-year-old pop star and one of the biggest singing sensations in both countries.
