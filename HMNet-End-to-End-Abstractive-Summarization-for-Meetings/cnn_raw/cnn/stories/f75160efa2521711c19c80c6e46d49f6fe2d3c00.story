(CNN) -- Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder was seen Sunday sitting with the outgoing president of the Navajo Nation as the NFL team continues taking heat for not changing its name, a term considered derogatory by many Native Americans.

Fox Sports showed Ben Shelly and his wife -- both wearing Redskins hats -- sitting next to Snyder for the Redskins vs. Cardinals game in Arizona on Sunday. Outside of the stadium in Glendale, demonstrators who take issue with the name stood with signs lambasting the team's name.

Opinion: Why Redskins decision is wrong

Shelly's term expires in January. He ran for a second term but lost his re-election bid in the primary last year.

Deswood Tome, a spokesman for Shelly, told CNN affiliate WJLA in Washington that Shelly was there to support a franchising agreement in which Snyder agreed to sell Navajo art and crafts at FedEx Field.

The Cardinals defeated the Redskins, 30-20.
