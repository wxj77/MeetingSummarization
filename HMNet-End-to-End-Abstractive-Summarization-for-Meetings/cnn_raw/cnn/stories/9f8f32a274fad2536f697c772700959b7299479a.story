(Mashable) -- Stuart Hughes, the British jeweler known for his expensive remakes of popular gadgets, is at it again, this time with a diamond-clad iPhone 4 with a price tag of 5 million pounds, or roughly $8 million.

The handmade bezel contains approximately 500 individual flawless diamonds that total more than 100 carats.

There's 53 additional diamonds in the back, and the main navigation button is made of platinum, holding a single cut 7.4 carat pink diamond.

If you know diamonds, all of this probably means something to you. To us, it just sounds really, really expensive.

Only two of these will ever be made, so don't worry: if you buy one, the chances of bumping into someone who has the exact same phone at a party are quite slim.
