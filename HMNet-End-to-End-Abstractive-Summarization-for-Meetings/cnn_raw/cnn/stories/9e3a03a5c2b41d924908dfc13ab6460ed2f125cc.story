(CNN)Warner Bros. has won a bidding war for the movie rights to "It's What I Do: A Photographer's Life of Love and War," a memoir by Lynsey Addario.

Jennifer Lawrence is attached to star in a package that also includes director Steven Spielberg and producer Andrew Lazar.

Addario is a war photographer who has spent time in war zones ranging from Afghanistan to the Congo to Somalia. She is one of the few females in a predominantly male club and was also at one point kidnapped.

Wynn Wygal, an exec at Lazar's Warners-based banner Mad Chance Productions, was instrumental in bringing in the book.

This is the second major project to be thrown in development centering on a real-life figure to which Lawrence is attached. In January, she and her "Hunger Games" director Francis Lawrence boarded "The Dive", the true love story of Cuban diver Francisco 'Pipin' Ferreras and the French-born diver Audrey Mestre.

Lawrence is currently shooting Joy, in which she portrays Miracle Mop inventor Joy Mangano.

Spielberg, Lazar and Warners first teamed to make "American Sniper" before Spielberg left the project over budgetary concerns. This look at war will be a take two.
