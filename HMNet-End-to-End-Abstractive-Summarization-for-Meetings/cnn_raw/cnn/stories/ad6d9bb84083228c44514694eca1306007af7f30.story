(CNN) -- The reaction to this announcement could be truly outrageous.

The 1980s cult cartoon series (not to mention a series of dolls) "Jem and the Holograms" has an official release date: October 23, 2015.

"G.I. Joe Retaliation" director Jon Chu is taking on the project, and he announced an online talent search back in March.

Long before "Hannah Montana," Jem was a rock star with a secret identity: Jerrica Benton.

She and her all-girl band the Holograms were constantly locking horns with the Misfits (after all, they claimed in the theme song that "their songs are better.")

In the movie, Jem will be played by Aubrey Peeples ("Sharknado"), and well-known actresses Molly Ringwald and Juliette Lewis were also given roles.

Can Chu bring a classic cartoon to the silver screen the same way he did with "G.I. Joe?" We'll know about a year from now.
