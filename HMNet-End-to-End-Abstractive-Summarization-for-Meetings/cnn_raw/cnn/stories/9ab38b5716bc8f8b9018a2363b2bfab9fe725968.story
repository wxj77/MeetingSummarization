(CNN) -- Dutch champions AZ Alkmaar have confirmed Dick Advocaat as their new head coach until the end of the season.

AZ sought permission from the Belgian FA (KBVB) over the possibility of their national-team coach joining them for the rest of the campaign after sacking Ronald Koeman on Saturday.

A statement posted on the club's official Web site said: "AZ and Dick Advocaat reached agreement on Tuesday on a contract for him to be head coach until the end of the current season.

"The 62-year-old will combine the role with the job of Belgium coach and will be on the bench against PSV on Saturday."

The Alkmaar club won the Eredivisie under Louis van Gaal last season but have struggled this term and currently find themselves in seventh place, 19 points behind leaders FC Twente.

The former Netherlands, PSV Eindhoven and Rangers coach has already set out his goal for the season.

"We need to get European football at AZ," Advocaat told AZ TV. "If we do not get that, then I have done something wrong."

AZ face Standard Liege in Belgium in their final Champions League Group Group H game on Wednesday.
