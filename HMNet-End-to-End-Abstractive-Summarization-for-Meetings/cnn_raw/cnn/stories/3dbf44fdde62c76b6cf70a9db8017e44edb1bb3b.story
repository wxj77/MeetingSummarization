(CNN) -- A 16-year-old Pennsylvania boy is facing murder charges, accused of fatally shooting a cab driver who he believed was intentionally taking a longer route to his destination.

Aazis Richardson is accused of shooting the cab driver, Vincent Darbenzio, 47, twice in the back of his head while still in the cab, according to Lackawanna County Assistant District Attorney Gene Talerico.

Richardson believed Darbenzio had ignored his route suggestions in attempt to increase the fare, according to Talerico.

"I just told him, 'take this way;' he didn't want to listen -- he got his (expletive) shot," Richardson told CNN affiliate WNEP.

Calls and e-mails to the Lackawanna County public defender's office, which is representing Richardson, were not immediately returned.

As Richardson was being taken away, he showed no remorse for the driver or his family telling WNEP, "my homies died, everybody gotta die."

Richardson was charged as an adult with multiple counts of murder in the first, second and third degrees, as well as robbery and firearms-related offenses, according Talerico.

On Sunday, more than 50 of Darbenzio's friends and family members held a vigil near the spot where Darbenzio was killed, according to the victim's brother, Chris Darbenzio.

Richardson is currently being held without bail at the Lackawanna County Prison, according to the district attorney's office.
