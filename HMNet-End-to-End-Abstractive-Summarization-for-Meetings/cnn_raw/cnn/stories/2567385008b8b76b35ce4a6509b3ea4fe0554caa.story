Travis Baumgartner, the man accused of killing three people during a robbery attempt at a Canadian university, was arrested Saturday by U.S. border officials in Washington, police said.

He was caught while attempting to cross into the United States at the Lynden, Washington, U.S.-Canada border, south of Abbotsford, British Columbia.

"We're grateful to the border officials at Lynden, Washington, for their excellent work in arresting a man we believe was armed and extremely dangerous," Bob Hassel, superintendent of the Edmonton Police criminal investigations division, said in a statement.

Baumgartner -- who was driving a dark blue Ford F-150 with what was likely his mother's license plate -- will be brought back to Edmonton, the statement read. His arrest ended a 36-hour manhunt.

Edmonton police say Baumgartner is behind the Friday robbery of an armored vehicle at the University of Alberta. The shooting left three security employees dead and a fourth critically injured.

Canadian authorities filed warrants for three counts of murder for the 21-year-old man, who worked at the same security firm as the victims.

He "is believed to be one of several armored company employees that attended the U of A around midnight" on Friday "to make a delivery," Edmonton police said in a statement.

Before his capture, both police and his mother begged Baumgartner to turn himself in.

"Trav, as your mother, I ask that you come forward now and take responsibility for your actions," said Sandy Baumgartner, according to the Edmonton Police Service.

"Please Travis, I love you, and I'm pleading with you with all of my heart, to end this without further bloodshed. As your mother, I promise to you now, that I will be there by your side to support you."
