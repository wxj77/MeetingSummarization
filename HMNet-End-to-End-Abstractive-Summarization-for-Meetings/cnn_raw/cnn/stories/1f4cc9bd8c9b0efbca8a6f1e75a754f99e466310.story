(CNN Student News) -- September 18, 2013

As the investigation into Monday's shooting at the Washington Navy Yard moves forward, Americans pause to remember the victims of the attack. CNN Student News reports on the latest developments, and then we head to Italy to witness the largest salvage operation of its kind. We also examine the threat of so-called "superbugs," and we meet a young artist who uses her talent to help others.
