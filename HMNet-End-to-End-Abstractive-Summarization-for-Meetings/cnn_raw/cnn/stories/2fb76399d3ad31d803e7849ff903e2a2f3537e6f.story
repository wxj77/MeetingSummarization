New York (CNN) -- Talks between the National Hockey League and the locked-out players' association are expected to resume Tuesday, according to a source close to the negotiations.

The league had canceled regular season games through October 24 after unsuccessful negotiations over a collective bargaining agreement.

The last time the NHL canceled preseason games was in 2004, which preceded a year-long lockout of the players by the owners.

The regular season had been scheduled to begin Thursday.
