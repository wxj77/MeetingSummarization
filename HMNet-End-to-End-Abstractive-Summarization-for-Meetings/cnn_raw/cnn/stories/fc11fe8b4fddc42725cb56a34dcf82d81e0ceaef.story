(CNN) -- A virus is forcing Cher to postpone the opening of the second leg of her "Dressed to Kill" tour this week.

"Cher was diagnosed over the weekend with what doctors termed an 'acute viral infection' and has been required to be on full bed rest for several days," according to an announcement on the ticket sales website.

Cher's show Thursday in Albany, New York, and Saturday in Manchester, New Hampshire, have been rescheduled for October 6 and 7, respectively, the site said.

She is expected to return to the stage in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Monday night.

Cher, 68, launched her current tour in March, selling out all 49 shows in the first leg ending in July, according to Billboard magazine. Those shows grossed nearly $55 million from 610,000 fans.

Another 30 shows across the United States are on the calendar over the next two months.

The singer's representatives did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment on Cher's illness.

The next leg of her shows should really live up to the "Dressed to Kill" billing as she adds new costumes designed by Bob Mackie.
