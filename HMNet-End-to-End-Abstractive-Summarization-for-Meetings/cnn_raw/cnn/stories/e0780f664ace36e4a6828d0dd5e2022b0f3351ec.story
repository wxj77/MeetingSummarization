(CNN) -- Thursday was quite the day for movie news, between "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" and "Toy Story 4," but we also got new, final looks at two of this holiday season's highest profile films as well.

The first trailer for "Into the Woods" gave us a taste of what to expect, but the final one gave us Meryl Streep belting it out and a look at the cast of fairy tale characters, including Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood, Anna Kendrick's Cinderella and more -- not to mention Johnny Depp as the Big Bad Wolf.

Going by this, it looks like the lines will be long to check out Disney's wondrous big musical on Christmas Day.

Meanwhile, "The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies" was no slouch in the wonder department, delivering as-usual astounding special effects.

They're all there: Legolas, Gandalf, Saruman, Bilbo and all those hunky dwarves.

And as promised, it looks like there's a huge battle coming.

The real question is: Between "The Hobbit" or "Into the Woods," which will be a bigger hit during the holidays?
