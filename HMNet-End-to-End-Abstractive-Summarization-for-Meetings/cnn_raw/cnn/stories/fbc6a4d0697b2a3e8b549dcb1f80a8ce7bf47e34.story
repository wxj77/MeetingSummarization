LONDON, England -- Chelsea are waiting on the fitness of John Terry ahead of Wednesday's Champions League match with Valencia, but Frank Lampard has been ruled out.

John Terry tries out his protective mask during training for Chelsea on Tuesday.

Center-back Terry suffered a broken cheekbone during Saturday's 0-0 draw with Fulham, and Chelsea manager Avram Grant will see how he fares during training on Tuesday before making a decision on his availability.

Terry trained at Valencia's Mestalla stadium with a face mask on after surgery on Sunday.

"John Terry wants to play which is very good. Now we need to wait for training and then we will speak with the medical department and decide," said Grant.

Grant has confirmed that Lampard will definitely sit the game out though as the midfielder continues to recover from his thigh injury.

Midfielder Michael Essien, who scored a last-minute winner for Chelsea to knock Valencia out of last season's Champions League, has also been battling a leg injury but he took part in training on Tuesday and is expected to play. E-mail to a friend
