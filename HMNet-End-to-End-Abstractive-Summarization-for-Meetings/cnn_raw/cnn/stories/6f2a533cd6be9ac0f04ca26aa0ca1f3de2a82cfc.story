A French footballer's girlfriend could face a fine for her furious Twitter tirade filled with the f-word.

Shortly after France's World Cup lineup was announced Tuesday, Anara Atanes -- the girlfriend of player Samir Nasri -- took to social media to express her displeasure that he wasn't on the roster.

"F*** France and F*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager," the 26-year-old British model posted on her Twitter account.

"They are idiots! We all know what you meant! F*** the national team and that stupid coach! Nasri is a great player," she tweeted.

Atanes later apologized for her comments, saying they were not "aimed at the nation as a whole."

But coach Didier Deschamps filed a civil lawsuit against her Friday, charging that she publicly insulted him.

Deschamps' lawyer, Carlo Alberto Brusa, told CNN that the lawsuit was filed due to the "seriousness of her comments."

The French Football Federation said it supports Deschamps' decision to file the suit.

"The unanimous reaction confirms that all of France condemns these insults," the FFF said on its website.

Deschamps defended his decision to leave the 26-year-old midfielder off the squad, telling reporters this week that Nasri "is a quality player, but his performance on the French national team is not at the same level as that at (his English club) Manchester City."

Nasri was handed a three-match ban after swearing at a reporter following France's loss to Spain in the 2012 European Championship. He was more circumspect this time, tweeting about his omission: "That's life. Another World Cup at home. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."
