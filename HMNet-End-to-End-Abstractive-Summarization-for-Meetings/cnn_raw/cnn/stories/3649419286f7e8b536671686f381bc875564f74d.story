(EW.com) -- "Nashville" fans have a reason to cheer. ABC has just ordered a full season of the freshman country series.

The Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere drama has received a pickup for nine more hours. The Wednesday-night series joins ABC's freshman aliens-next-door comedy "The Neighbors" in getting an extension into spring, and returning drama "Scandal" receiving a full ride.

ABC also ordered three more scripts each for Friday comedies "Malibu Country" and "Last Man Standing," which have performed solidly in their 8 p.m. block the past couple weeks.

No word yet on fellow freshman dramas "Last Resort" and "666 Park Avenue." "Nashville" has performed a bit better than either of them, though industry buzz has speculated that one (likely "Last Resort") will receive an order for more episodes.

ABC points out that "Nashville" attracts an upscale audience, pulling 30 percent higher ratings among Adults 18-49 in homes with at least $100,000 in annual income to make it the "top indexing" new broadcast drama. Here's how ABC's freshman dramas are stacking up in the ratings after you include DVR:

"Nashville" = 9.4 million viewers and a 3.2 in 18-49

"Last Resort" = 9.2 million and 2.4 in 18-49

"666 Park Avenue" = 6.7 million and 2.4 in 18-49
