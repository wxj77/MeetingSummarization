(CNN) -- Authorities are investigating a Massachusetts comic book dealer who allegedly posted online comments suggesting members of Congress should be targeted after the January 8 shooting that left Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, critically wounded, police said Friday.

In a blog post titled "1 down and 534 to go," 39-year-old Travis Corcoran allegedly wrote: "It is absolutely, absolutely unacceptable to shoot indiscriminately."

"Target only politicians and their staff and leave regular citizens alone," it said.

Police also seized "a large amount" of weapons from Corcoran's home in Arlington, Massachusetts, last week, according to police Chief Frederick Ryan.

Corcoran's firearms license has been suspended as authorities investigate how and where the weapons were purchased, the police chief said. There is no indication they were acquired illegally, he added.

The blog, called TJICistan, is no longer viewable online, and Corcoran was not immediately reachable for comment.
