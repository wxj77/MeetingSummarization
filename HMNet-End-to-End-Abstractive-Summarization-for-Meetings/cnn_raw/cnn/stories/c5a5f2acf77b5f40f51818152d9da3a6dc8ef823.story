(CNN) -- Suspended last season amid allegations that he bullied a teammate, former Miami player Richie Incognito has been reinstated by the NFL.

"He can fully participate," said league spokesman Greg Aiello.

Incognito is a free agent and is set to meet with several NFL teams. The offensive lineman huddled with Tampa Bay on Monday.

Incognito was suspended by the Dolphins in November after Jonathan Martin abruptly left the team, saying he was bullied by him.

His attorney David Cornell called it "harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing."

An NFL-commissioned report released in February found that three Dolphins starters, including Incognito, engaged in "a pattern of harassment." According to the report, Martin had been the victim of "sexually explicit remarks" and "racial insults" from Incognito, John Jerry and Mike Pouncey, while it was revealed that Martin contemplated suicide as a result of their actions.

Incognito's lawyer challenged the report, calling it "replete with errors."

Martin was traded to San Francisco in March.

CNN's Marcus Hooper contributed to this report.
