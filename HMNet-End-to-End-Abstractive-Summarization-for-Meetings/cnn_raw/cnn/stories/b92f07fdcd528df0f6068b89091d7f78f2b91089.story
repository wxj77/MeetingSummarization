(CNN) -- Evangelist Billy Graham was at home Sunday after being discharged from an Asheville, North Carolina, hospital where he was treated for pneumonia, the hospital said.

The 92-year old minister was admitted to the Mission Hospital early on Wednesday and returned to his home in the nearby town of Montreat, North Carolina, Sunday afternoon. His physicians said Graham's response to treatment has been good, but stressed his recovery will be slow.

"He has responded very well to treatment, with progressive improvement since his admission," said Lucian Rice, Graham's primary care physician. "We expect continuing recuperation at home with very gradual recovery, returning to normal activities over several weeks. I'm delighted that he has come back this fast."

During his hospital stay, Graham watched television and remained in good spirits, spokesman A. Larry Ross said. He was visited Wednesday evening by his eldest daughter, Gigi, and met with his pastor, Dr. Don Wilton, Thursday morning.

Ross said Graham will look forward to visits from close friends once he is stronger.

Graham has been hospitalized or treated for several ailments over the years, including a head surgery, a fall, intestinal bleeding, prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease. According to Ross, Graham has remained in good health overall.

Age-related conditions -- including macular degeneration and hearing loss -- have kept Graham at home in recent years, but the evangelist is involved in writing projects, including a manuscript for a book about aging, Ross said.

The founder of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has preached to millions of people over six decades, and has provided counsel to U.S. presidents, beginning with President Harry S. Truman.

Graham's wife, Ruth Bell Graham, died in 2007.
