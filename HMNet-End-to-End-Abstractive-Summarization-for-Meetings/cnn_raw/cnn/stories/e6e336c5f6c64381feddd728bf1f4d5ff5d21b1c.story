(CNN) -- Armed militants took over three police camps Saturday in northern Kenya, a siege that prompted a significant response by local and national authorities, a Kenyan agency said.

The attack was centered in the village of Lorokon in Turkana County, which borders Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north and a sliver of Ethiopia to the northeast.

Kenya's National Disaster Operation Centre tweeted that the siege comes on the heels of a border dispute between the Turkana and Pokot peoples.

"(Authorities) are combating the bandits in Turkana, but there is heavy resistance," the agency tweeted Saturday evening.

The Disaster Operation Centre followed up about two hours later by noting Kenya's Ministry of the Interior is coordinating the response, working in conjunction with local police officers and reservists.

Kenyan police were moved to the area "to combat the banditry and to reopen" a key road in the area. Efforts were also under way to work with leaders in both West Pokot and Turkana "to resolve the border dispute in Lorokon," the national agency said.

A curfew was established Saturday night in parts of both these counties.
