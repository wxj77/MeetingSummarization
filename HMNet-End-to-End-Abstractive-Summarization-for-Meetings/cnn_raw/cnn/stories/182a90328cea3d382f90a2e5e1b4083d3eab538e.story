(CNN) -- Guitarist Carlos Santana signed on as the first rock 'n' roll resident artist at the Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel and Casino's new concert hall, The Joint.

Santana will not play any other shows west of the Mississippi River over the next two years.

The two-year deal calls for Santana to play 36 shows a year, starting May 27, the hotel said.

The Joint, which holds 4,000, opens next month with Paul McCartney in a show that sold out earlier this month in just seven seconds.

Santana said his show -- "Supernatural Santana: A Trip Through the Hits" -- will "mix up a little practical spirituality with a rebel-from-the-street vibe, and with lots of incredible music."

"My wish is for it to be a night that will move you to dance, to cry, to laugh and to feel the totality and fullness of being alive," Santana said.

Santana, who has sold 90 million records over the past 40 years, is credited with blending American rock with Latin jazz.

Santana's deal is exclusive, meaning he will play no other shows west of the Mississippi River over the next two years, according to the news release announcing it.

Santana's residency is produced by AEG Live, the same company that brought Celine Dion, Elton John, Bette Midler and Cher to The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.

"Now we are setting the standard for rock 'n' roll residencies with this new deal," said John Meglen, AEG Live president.
