(CNN) -- Joint host nation Gabon opened their Africa Cup of Nations campaign with a comfortable 2-0 Group C victory over Niger at the newly-built L'Amitie stadium in Libreville.

Gabon were always in control against a Niger side making their finals debut -- and they deservedly took the lead after half an hour.

Stephane Nguema produced a superb cross from the right and Saint-Etienne striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed home from a tight angle.

And they doubled that advantage on the stroke of half-time when Nguema nodded in from close range after Aubameyang's own header was only parried by the goalkeeper.

Gabon's German coach Gernot Rohr told reporters: "We won and we played well, but more difficult teams than Niger lie ahead for us.

"I hope we can continue on this path. I'm pleased as we didn't concede a goal, didn't pick up any injuries, and only got one booking," he added.

The 40,000 capacity stadium also hosted the second group C encounter, with Tunisia beating north African neighbors Morocco 2-1.

Tunisia defeated their rivals in the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations final -- and they once again had bragging rights thanks to goals in either half from Khaled Korbi and Youssef Msakni.

Tunisia nearly took the lead on the half hour mark when Zouhaier Dhaouadi's long-range effort smacked the post.

However, just four minutes later, Morocco were finally undone when Korbi's dipping free-kick evaded the defensive wall and went in off the upright.

And Tunisia doubled their lead 15 minutes from time when substitute Msakni evaded two challenges to score his first goal for his country.

Houssine Kharja pulled a late goal back when he converted Ahmed Kantari's cross -- although Kantari appeared off-side when receiving the ball.

And Morocco nearly snatched an unlikely equalizer when Fiorentina midfielder Kharja's effort shaved the crossbar.
