(CNN) -- Goran Stevanovic has been named as Ghana's new national coach in his first major appointment, replacing fellow Serbian Milovan Rajevac.

Rajevac quit in September when his two-year contract finished, having taken the African team to the quarterfinals of the World Cup for the first time in South Africa last year.

The 44-year-old Stevanovic, previously head coach of Partizan Belgrade in his native country and assistant with Serbia and Montenegro from 2003-06, will be unveiled at a press conference on Wednesday.

"The Ghana Football Association have appointed a new coach for the Black Stars. He is Goran Stevanovic," the GFA said in a statement. "We have successfully negotiated with the coach and he will replace his compatriot, Milovan Rajevac."

Stevanovic, who guided Partizan to the Serbian league title last season before resigning in April, headed off the likes of former France World Cup winner Marcel Desailly and ex-Portugal boss Humberto Coelho after being named on a five-man shortlist.

He is Ghana's third Serbian coach since 2004 following the reigns of 56-year-old Rajevac and Ratomir Dujkovic, which were separated by a stint with Frenchman Claude Le Roy in charge.
