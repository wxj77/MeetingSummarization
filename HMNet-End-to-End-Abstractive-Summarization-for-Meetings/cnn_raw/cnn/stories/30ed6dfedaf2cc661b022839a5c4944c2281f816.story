(CNN) -- [Updated 2:30 p.m. Monday, May 7] This photo was taken in the Peruvian capital of Lima, where it's common to see archaeological ruins amid the urban landscape.

Many of these pre-Incan "huacas," or sacred places, are now at risk because of a lack of funding and protection, according to Agence France-Presse.

"Most huacas are officially the cultural patrimony of the nation, but the area around them that cannot be touched is not delineated," archaeologist Cristian Vizconde told AFP. "This omission allows developers and squatters to invade them, or mayors to build parks and playing fields on them."

Congrats to CNN.com reader "Jmccarley" for being the first to answer Lima in the comment section.

[Original post] Do you know where this photo was taken?

If you think you know the answer -- or if you just want to take a wild guess -- post it in the comments area below. Later in the day, we'll reveal where the photo was taken and give credit to those who figured it out first. (The more detail, the better!)

Each Monday morning, we'll post a new photo and challenge you to tell us its origin. The photo might be related to a prominent news story or theme -- or it might just be something that caught our eye.

Good luck!
