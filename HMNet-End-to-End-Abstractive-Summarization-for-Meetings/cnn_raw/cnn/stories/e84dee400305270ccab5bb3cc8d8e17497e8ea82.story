London (CNN) -- Zara Phillips, the eldest granddaughter of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, had a baby girl Friday, the royal family announced.

The baby girl, whose name has not been announced, is the queen's fourth great-grandchild and 16th in line to the throne.

Phillips is the daughter of Princess Anne and a cousin of Princes William and Harry. She is married to rugby player Mike Tindall, who has captained the England team.

Phillips also goes by her husband's last name, but is mostly known by her maiden name.

The queen and Prince Philip, as well as the couple's parents, "have been informed and are delighted with the news," a statement from the queen's press secretary said.

"The baby's name will be confirmed in due course."

Mike Tindall was present for the birth at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, the statement added.

The baby weighs 7 pounds and 12 ounces.

Phillips is a talented horsewoman who helped her team to a silver medal for Team GB at the Olympic Games in 2012.
