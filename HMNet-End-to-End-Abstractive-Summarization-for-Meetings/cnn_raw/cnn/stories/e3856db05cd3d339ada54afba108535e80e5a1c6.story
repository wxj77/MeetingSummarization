(CNN) -- The office of Georgia's Secretary of State confirmed Tuesday that its website has been experiencing intermittent problems on Election Day.

A website that provides poll location information was showing an error message earlier Tuesday.

"We are experiencing difficulties with [our website]. Our IT folks are working on it. We're throwing resources at it to solve the problem," Jared Thomas, chief of staff and press secretary for the office, told CNN.

7 things that will almost definitely happen on election night

Two of Georgia's elections Tuesday hold high significance. Its Senate race could help determine majority control in the upper chamber, while its gubernatorial race could see the ouster of its Republican incumbent governor for Democrat Jason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter.

Voting irregularities are closely monitored on big election days across the country by political parties, independent groups and the media.

More serious claims have been made elsewhere. In Connecticut, Gov. Dan Malloy is asking a judge to extend voting hours after delays and other problems were reported at Hartford polling locations Tuesday morning, according to local reports.

CNN affiliate WAVY in Virginia received reports from local voters who said they experienced voting machine errors at multiple locations.

And in North Carolina, conservative activist James O'Keefe released a new video Monday showing how he obtained ballots at polling stations by pretending to be inactive voters. The point of the video was to show the need for voter ID laws, which are scheduled to start in North Carolina in 2016.
