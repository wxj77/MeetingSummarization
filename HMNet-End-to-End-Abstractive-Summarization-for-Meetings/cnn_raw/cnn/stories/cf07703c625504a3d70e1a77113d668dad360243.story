(CNN) -- Country singer Keith Urban is expected to have throat surgery this month, after a polyp was discovered on his vocal cords, according to his publicist.

The surgery is considered a minor procedure, Paul Freundlich said in a news release.

The musician will undergo "an undetermined period of recuperation that will require the postponement of the "All for the Hall' benefit concert," Freundlich said.

Though Urban is still expected to perform at the Country Music Awards on November 9, he has had to "substantially scale back his appearances requiring multiple songs," Freundlich added.

"All other appearances will be rescheduled in the new year," the statement said.
