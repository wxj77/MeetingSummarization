(PEOPLE.com) -- Just how telling are 140 characters?

Amid new tabloid reports of infidelity by Ashton Kutcher, and trouble in his marriage to Demi Moore, the two -- who are currently on different coasts -- have curbed their prolific Tweeting in some possibly telling ways.

On September 23, Moore shared a quote from Greek philosopher Epictetus, writing, "When we are offended at any man's fault, turn to yourself & study your own failings. Then you will forget your anger."

The pair also spent their sixth wedding anniversary -- September 24 -- apart.

Kutcher arrived in San Diego on September 23 for a weekend of partying with his former That '70s Show costar Danny Masterson. Among their stops: Fluxx nightclub, where they had a VIP table. The actor also refrained from Tweeting anything on his wedding anniversary.

Moore, 48, has been in New York City to promote the short film she directed as part of Lifetime's TV anthology, "Five." The actress attended the premiere along with Jennifer Aniston, who also directed a short, on Monday night.

Kutcher, 33, who recently returned to TV in "Two and a Half Men" was in Los Angeles, where he presented an award to Ryan Seacrest Tuesday night during L.A.'s Promise Gala 2011.

The actors' reps have not commented yet.

The couple, who began dating in 2003 and married in 2005, dealt with rumors of infidelity and marital trouble a year ago. At the time, they took a trip to Israel for what the actor described as a spiritual journey.
