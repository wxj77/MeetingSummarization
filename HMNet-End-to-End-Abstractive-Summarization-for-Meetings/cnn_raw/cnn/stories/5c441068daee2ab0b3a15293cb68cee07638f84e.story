In our first story, we hear how Secretary Sebelius responds to criticism of the Obamacare website, and we discuss how the law might affect millions of Americans' existing health care coverage. Next, it's off to Germany, where officials are angry about alleged, Cold War-style espionage. After reporting on a salvage operation from Blackbeard's flagship, we discuss the booming business of Halloween.
