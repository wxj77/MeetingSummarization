(Mashable) -- Apple is investigating several issues with its new iPad's Wi-Fi connectivity, according to an internal AppleCare document unearthed by MacRumors.

According to the document, symptoms include "intermittent connectivity, slow Wi-Fi speeds" and "Wi-Fi network not seen" -- all of which sound quite serious.

A thread on Apple's online support forums discussing the issues currently has 712 replies, indicating that the problem is very real. For comparison, a thread about the iPad overheating issue, which was widely discusses in the media, currently has 876 replies.

Most of the replies on the thread indicate that the problem affects only the Wi-Fi version of the new iPad and not the 3G model.

If the AppleCare document is real, Apple is currently trying to "capture" and replace iPads which have problems with Wi-Fi connectivity. However, there's currently no official word from Apple about the issue.
