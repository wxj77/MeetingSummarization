(EW.com) -- "Jersey Shore's" Vinny Guadagnino is getting his own MTV talk show.

Considered the most sensitive of the "Shore" boys, Vinny will star in a hybrid talk/reality series for the network titled "The Show with Vinny."

The project will tweak the usual talk format by taking celebrities out of the studio and having Vinny interview them in his Staten Island home with his colorful Italian family. Celebrity guests will come over for a meal and candid conversation, with lots of commentary from his hostess mother Paula, his partying Uncle Nino and others.

MTV: Why 'Jersey Shore' is ending

"Vinny's unique mix of humor, intelligence, curiosity and heart make him the perfect choice for this genre-busting take on the interview format," said Chris Linn, MTV executive VP of Programming and head of production. "As the lives of the 'Jersey Shore' cast evolve, we are excited to explore new ground while still delivering the laughs and surprises that fans have come to expect from the franchise."

Vinny will also appear on the upcoming fundraising special "Restore the Shore" (more details on that here). The Nov.ember 15 special encourages viewers to contribute to the rebuilding of Seaside Heights, the main location of MTV's hit "Jersey Shore," which will soon air its final episode.

Former WB president taking over MTV programming

"The Show with Vinny" is executive-produced by "Jersey Shore" producer SallyAnn Salsano, along with MTV's Jacquelyn French, and will represent the third series spawned from party-hearty reality show. There's also "Snooki & JWoww," which returns for its second season January 8, and "The Pauly D Project."

"Shore" is MTV's highest-rated series ever and continues to perform strong on Thursday nights, averaging 3.5 million viewers.
