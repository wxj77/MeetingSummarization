(CNN) -- Florida authorities are investigating the death of a custodian whose body was found at a launchpad at the Kennedy Space Center on Tuesday afternoon, NASA reported.

The man, whose identity was not released, was found in a storage building near a liquid oxygen tank at pad 39A, one of the sites from which Apollo and space shuttle missions were launched, the space agency said. The pad leader discovered the body, and paramedics were unable to revive the man, NASA said.

No cause of death was released Tuesday afternoon. The man worked for the Brevard Achievement Center, which has a contract at the Cape Canaveral site.

The center, which places people with disabilities in jobs, said it was "deeply saddened" by the news and extended its sympathy to the man's family.
