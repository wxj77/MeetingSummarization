(CNN) -- A jet crashed Sunday near Freeport, on the island of Grand Bahama, killing all nine people on board, authorities said.

The aircraft hit a crane at the Freeport Ship Yard and crashed into a nearby "junk site," police said.

No U.S. agencies are involved, and the Royal Bahamas Police Force is handling the investigation, a police spokesman said.

Police released the names of five victims Monday that includes Myles Munroe and his wife Ruth.

Myles Munroe was the senior pastor of Bahamas Faith Ministries International Fellowship, that group's website says. Ruth served as co-pastor.

The two were friends of Andrew Young, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who was also scheduled to arrive in Freeport.

"Ambassador Young expresses his deep sadness over the tragic death of his friends Dr. Myles and Mrs. Ruth Munroe. He offers condolences to the Munroe family and the families of the other souls who lost their lives as a result of this shocking plane crash," the Andrew Young Foundation said in a statement.

Young is scheduled to speak at a conference starting Monday in Freeport.

The Global Leadership Forum will continue this week, according to Munroe's organization.

"On behalf of Myles Munroe International and ITWLA. We would like to inform you that the Global Leadership Forum will continue," Myles Munroe International posted on its Facebook page. "This is what Dr. Munroe would have wanted."

The other identified victims are Stanley Jerome Thurston, Richard Howard Pinder and Frankhan Demeyer Cooper, all residents of the Bahamas.

The ITWLA is International Third World Leaders Association, which was founded by Munroe.
