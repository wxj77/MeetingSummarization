(CNN) -- There's some magic coming to a British stage.

Author J.K. Rowling has announced she is developing a play based on her "Harry Potter" stories. According to her website, Rowling is working in collaboration with award-winning producers Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender on the project.

"Over the years I have received countless approaches about turning Harry Potter into a theatrical production, but Sonia and Colin's vision was the only one that really made sense to me, and which had the sensitivity, intensity and intimacy I thought appropriate for bringing Harry's story to the stage," Rowling said in a statement.

"After a year in gestation it is exciting to see this project moving on to the next phase. I'd like to thank Warner Bros. for their continuing support in this project."

Warner Bros. is owned by CNN's parent company, Time Warner.

Rowling will reportedly be a producer of the play and work with a writer, but she will not be writing the play. The story will follow Potter in his early years as an orphan.

Directors and writers for the play, which will go into development in 2014, are currently being considered.
