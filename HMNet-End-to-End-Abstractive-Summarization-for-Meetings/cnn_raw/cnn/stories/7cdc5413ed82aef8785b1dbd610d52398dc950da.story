This list might help.

Global hotel booking site Agoda.com has just released the results of its Travel Smarts study, which looks at destinations with the highest-rated hotels in the world based on nearly 7 million customer reviews.

Overall, the site says Cape Town, South Africa, is number one, scoring an average of 8.43 out of a possible 10.
