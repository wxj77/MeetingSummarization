(CNN) -- A New York teenager with a 7,000-a-month texting habit now has a lot more to text about.

Brianna Hendrickson, 13, of Brooklyn won this  year's LG U.S. National Texting Championship by accurately typing the phrase "Old McDonald had a  farm, Ei, ei, oh! And on this farm he had a champ. W/a txtr here, and BFF there.  Here a text, there a text, erywhere a text-text!" in 60 seconds.

Brianna took home $50,000 and will compete in the LG Text For Good  Challenge, where she will have the chance to double her prize money and  win an additional $50,000 for a charity of her choice, the technology company said.

"I was really nervous when I saw the final phrase and worried my fingers wouldn't be fast enough," Brianna said. "Hearing my name announced was amazing and shocking all at the same time."

The final showdown pitted Brianna against two other teenagers and 48 year-old Joanne Rach from Chicago, Illinois. Rach won LG's national texting competition for parents and caregivers.

Finalists who competed in New York City had already messaged their way through preliminary competition, such as on-site texting challenges at concerts, text alerts on TV shows or texting from online tournaments. They endured blindfolds, complex phrases and marathon texting during the competition this week.

About 500,000 texters participated in preliminary rounds of the competition this year, LG said.
