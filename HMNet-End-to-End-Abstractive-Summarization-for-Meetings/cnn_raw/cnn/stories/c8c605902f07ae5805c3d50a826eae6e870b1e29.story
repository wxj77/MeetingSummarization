Today's show begins by remembering Kayla Mueller, a woman who dedicated her life to helping others. We're also looking into the increasing popularity of dashboard cameras: What kinds of impact have they had on everything from police work to disaster investigations? We explore five hardships caused by snow days, and we examine just how germy public places can be.
