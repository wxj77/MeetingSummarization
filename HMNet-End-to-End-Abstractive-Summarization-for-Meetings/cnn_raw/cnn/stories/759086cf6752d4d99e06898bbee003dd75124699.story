(CNN) -- A Taliban attack in southern Afghanistan killed eight officers and completely destroyed a police post, a provincial spokesman said Wednesday.

At least three more officers were injured in the Tuesday night attack near Lashkar Gah in Helmand province, according to Daud Ahmadi, the spokesman.

An investigation revealed it was an inside job, he said.

"It is now clear that a policeman from the post had contacts with the Taliban who invited the Taliban to conduct the attack," the spokesman said.

He said the policeman fled with the Taliban.

It was the second attack by the terror group in the province that day, he said.

On Tuesday morning, it targeted a bakery, killing two civilians and injuring 26 others, including officers collecting bread.
