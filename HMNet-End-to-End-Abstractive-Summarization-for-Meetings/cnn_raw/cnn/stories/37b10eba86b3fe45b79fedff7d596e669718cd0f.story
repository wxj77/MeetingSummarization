For the princely sum of $450 a night, travelers can snap up a basic suite in the spectacular Umaid Bhavan.

The elaborate 347-room palace is home to the Maharaja of Jodhpur, and is one of the largest private residences in the world.

After the Indian government abolished privy purses (a regular allowance the state gave royal families) in 1972, the Maharaja sought to cut costs and converted a third of the palace into a luxury hotel.

This section of the building now contains 64 luxury suites operated by hotel giant, the Taj Group.

"It's as if you are stepping back in time and you can have that same experience but with air conditioning, with WiFi and your Grohe shower head," said Raymond Bickson, managing director and CEO of the Taj Group.
