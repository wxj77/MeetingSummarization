Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Gunmen and suicide bombers attacked police in eastern Afghanistan Tuesday morning, leaving five officers dead, police said.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack that occurred in the city of Jalalabad.

Six or seven civilians were also injured in the violence and five of the attackers died, according to Mohammad Sharif Amin, a local police spokesman.

This attack comes a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Afghanistan for a trip to help repair strained relations with President Hamid Karzai.

Kerry landed in Kabul on Monday afternoon and met with Karzai at the presidential palace.

The attack, early Tuesday morning, happened some 145 kilometers (90 miles away) from Kabul.

At least eight attackers stormed a police station in Jalalabad, authorities said, igniting two car bombs and firing at officers.

The Taliban, which is known to inflate numbers of the dead in past attacks, said as many as 40 officers and 15 foreign trainers were killed.

That tally was not verified by Afghan police.
