Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN)At least 48 people were killed and dozens others injured Friday in what authorities said was a bombing at a Shiite Muslim mosque in southern Pakistan, according to a local hospital.

The attack took place just before Friday prayers started in the city of Shikarpur in Sindh province, said Sharjeel Mamon, the city's information minister.

Fifty people were injured, said to Shaukat Ali Memon, superintendent of the Civil Hospital in Shikarpur.

The militant group Jundallah claimed responsibility for the attack, the group's spokesman Ahmad Marwat said in a statement.

Pakistan is a majority Sunni Muslim country. Shiites make up about 10% to 15% of the country's population, according to the CIA World Factbook.

Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif strongly condemned the killings and vowed to fight terrorism.
