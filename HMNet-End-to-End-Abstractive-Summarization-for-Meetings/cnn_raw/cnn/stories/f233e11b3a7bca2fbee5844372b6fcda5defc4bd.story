(CNN)Reality star Farrah Abraham has nothing to hide, and that includes a lip augmentation procedure gone horribly wrong.

The TV personality and adult film actress recently shared photos on Twitter of the procedure's results, which left her top lip egregiously swollen.

"Girlfriends don't say I didn't warn ya!" the former "Teen Mom" captioned one of the images, throwing in the hashtag "#BOTCHED."

According to TMZ, Abraham underwent a new kind of procedure in which a doctor uses an implant in the lip instead of fillers. Abraham reportedly believes she had an allergic reaction to the anesthetic used.

It seems the 23-year-old has maintained a sense of humor about her medical mishap.

In another tweet, she joked that her lip injections make her look like Leela from the animated series "Futurama."
