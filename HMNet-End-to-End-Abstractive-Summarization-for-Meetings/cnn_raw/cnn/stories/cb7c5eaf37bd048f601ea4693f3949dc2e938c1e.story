(CNN) -- Longtime Cincinnati Reds shortstop Barry Larkin was voted into baseball's Hall of Fame on Monday, the major leagues announced.

Larkin was the only player voted into the Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers' Association of America this year. He will be inducted this summer, along with the late Chicago Cubs third baseman and broadcaster Ron Santo, who was chosen by baseball's Golden Era Committee in December.

Larkin, 47, spent his entire 19-season career in his native Cincinnati and was part of the Reds lineup that won the World Series in 1990. He was the National League most valuable player in 1995 and retired in 2004, with a .295 career batting average and 198 home runs.
