(CNN)  -- Novak Djokovic shrugged off an injury problem to turn out for Davis Cup holders Serbia in the doubles rubber against Sweden, but it proved in vain as the Wimbledon champion and Nenad Zimonjic slipped to defeat Saturday.

Djokovic pulled out of Friday's second singles match in Halmstadt with a knee problem, but he was not missed as his replacement Janko Tipsarevic gave  Serbia a 2-0 lead.

But the new world number one, who has lost just one singles match all year, was found wanting in doubles as he and Zimonjic went down 6-4 7-6 7-5 in two hours 24 minutes to unheralded home pair Simon Aspelin and Robert Lindstedt.

"I expected myself to adjust a little bit better in the rhythm of the return -- one of my main weapons wasn't working well as I was missing a lot of returns but that's because of their serves as well, which were great, and they were playing really well at the net," Djokovic told the official Davis Cup website.

But he added: "We are coming into the third day 2-1 up which is the most important thing and tomorrow we will try to end this tie."

Djokovic, winner of the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year, is scheduled to face Michael Ryderstedt in the first of the reverse singles as Serbia bid to wrap up the quarterfinal tie.
