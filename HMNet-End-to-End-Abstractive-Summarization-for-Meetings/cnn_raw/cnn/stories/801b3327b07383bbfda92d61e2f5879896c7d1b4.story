Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor David Arquette ended a one-month stint in a rehab facility, his representative said Sunday.

"He has left after completing treatment," Arquette representative Cindy Guagenti said.

Arquette, who split from wife Courteney Cox in October, entered a live-in rehab facility over the New Year's weekend, his rep said at the time.

Cox and Arquette were married for 11 years and have a 6-year-old daughter, Coco.

CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.
