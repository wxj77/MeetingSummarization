(EW.com ) -- Not one but two Gyllenhaals will tread the Broadway boards this season.

Jake Gyllenhaal will make his Broadway debut in the U.S. premiere of Nick Payne's Olivier-nominated play "Constellations." Payne also wrote "If There Is I Haven't Found it Yet," the play in which Gyllenhaal made his New York stage debut in 2012 at the Roundabout Theatre Company.

Directed by Michael Longhurst, "Constellations" tells the story of two strangers who continue to meet by chance under the parallel universe framework of string theory. Press notes describe the piece as "an explosive new play about the boundless potential of a first encounter, free will, and friendship."

The Manhattan Theatre Club and Royal Court Theatre's limited engagement will play Broadway's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre beginning December 16, 2014. Opening night is scheduled for January 13, 2015. Additional creative team members and casting for the show â€” namely the role of physicist Marianne â€” will be announced soon.

Gyllenhaal's sister Maggie makes her Broadway debut this season opposite Cynthia Nixon and Ewan McGregor in Tom Stoppard's "The Real Thing," due to begin in October.
