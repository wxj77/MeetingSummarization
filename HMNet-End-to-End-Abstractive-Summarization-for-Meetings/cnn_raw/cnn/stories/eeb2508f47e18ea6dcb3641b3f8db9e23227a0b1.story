(CNN) -- Black Caviar, the undisputed queen of the horse racing world, is set to make a return to action next year.

The Australian thoroughbred had been expected to retire after suffering a strained muscle in her hindquarters during her victory in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Ascot last June.

The 'Wonder from Down Under' has become an international superstar after winning 22 races out of 22 and picking up over $6.6 million.

Alongside the likes of Frankel and Camelot, Black Caviar has breathed new life into racing with her profile growing with every race.

Her reputation has even secured her a place on the front page of December's Australian Vogue, kicking away the likes of Elle Macpherson and Delta Goodrem.

The future had looked unsure for Black Caviar after she was diagnosed with a grade-four tear of the quadriceps muscle and grade-two tear of the sacroiliac.

The six-year-old mare was forced to undergo intense laser therapy on a daily basis for two weeks at Newmarket before flying back to Melbourne.

A spell of walking in water, the equine version of water aerobics, has helped speed up her recovery with trainer Peter Moody keeping a keen eye on the progress.

Moody will now hold discussions with Black Caviar's owners to plan her return to the racecourse, while she undergoes light training at his Caulfield stables.

Black Caviar could return early next year in February's Lightning Stakes, a race which she has won for the past two years.

If she does not make that particular race, the mare could star at the William Reid Stakes at Moonee Valley in March.

The TJ Smith on April 13 remains the big draw for Moody with Black Caviar hoping to break Kingston Town's record of 14 Group One wins.
