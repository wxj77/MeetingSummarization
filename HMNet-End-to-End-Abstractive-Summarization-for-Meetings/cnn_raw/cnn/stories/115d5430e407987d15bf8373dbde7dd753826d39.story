Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Ted Cruz lauded the Republican Senate takeover Tuesday night, but shied away from endorsing Sen. Mitch McConnell to lead the new majority.

The Texas Republican declined to say whether he would vote for McConnell -- the current Senate minority leader -- to become the Senate majority leader.

"That'll be a decision for the conference to make and that'll be decided next week," Cruz told CNN's Wolf Blitzer twice on CNN.

"Tonight what I'm focused on is the results of this election, which is a resounding Republican majority," Cruz said.

It's not the first time that Cruz, a tea party favorite and potential 2016 presidential contender, has skirted the question, also declining to pledge his loyalty to McConnell in an interview with The Washington Post published Sunday.

But Cruz did say that Americans are "frustrated with what's happening in Washington."

And McConnell might just be the face of that Republican establishment, having served in Congress for the past three decades.

"Now the responsibility falls on us to lead with a positive, bold, optimistic, pro-jobs agenda and I hope that we see Republicans unite," Cruz said. "I think a lot of voters are skeptical of politicians in both parties and I very much hope that my party can validate and earn the trust that's been placed in us and that we can stand up, listen to the people."

Cruz also said he believes Republicans will be willing to work with Obama "if the President is willing to work with us."

And Cruz said Republicans need to pass legislation to repeal Obamacare, though he conceded that Obama would "almost surely" veto full repeal.
