(CNN) -- Grammy Award-winning singer Shakira has joined the growing chorus of opposition to Arizona's new immigration law.

Shakira met with leaders Thursday in Arizona Thursday before talking about the issue on CNN's "AC 360." She said some police and lawmakers in Arizona are worried about how the new law will be implemented.

"The mayor is very, very worried, as well as the chief of police here," Shakira said. "They're both very worried about the impact that implementation of this law will have on Latino families, the level of abuse that will be inflicted on Latinos, with or without papers."

The new measure requires Arizona police to determine whether people are in the United States legally if there is a reason to suspect they aren't.

The law, scheduled to go into effect 90 days after the close of the state's legislative session, would require immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times.

Supporters claim it is needed to control illegal immigration. Critics counter, saying it will create government-sanctioned racial profiling.

Shakira said she talked to women in Arizona who said they were scared about how the law would affect them.

"I just met with some families and women who have been subjected to domestic violence, and they are so concerned," the singer said. "They're going to live in fear to call the police or to report a crime that has been inflicted to them. They're trying to protect their kids and their own families from abusers. and now they're going to have to protect themselves from the government."

The Colombian singer said when she was in Arizona on Thursday, she thought about how the new law would affect her.

"If this law was already in effect today, for example, I could be detained and arrested and taken away because I don't even have my driver's license here. I 'm completely undocumented here," Shakira said.
