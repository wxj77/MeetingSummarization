(CNN) -- Maybe it didn't have quite the grandeur of President Barack Obama's historic inauguration four years ago. But Monday's Inauguration Day events showcased the pomp and circumstance of the U.S. government at its finest.

We may not have royal weddings in the States, but this is about as close as it gets.

And, where there is public spectacle, there is Twitter, the rapid-fire platform where the world's online social critics record their musings. Twitter said its users sent 1.1 million inauguration-related tweets during Monday's swearing-in ceremony, way up from 82,000 in 2009, when Twitter hadn't yet been widely adopted.

From politicos to comedians to ordinary citizens, some offered heartfelt thoughts on the historical importance of the day, while others jockeyed for a cheap laugh and a few retweets.

Here are some of our favorites. (We'll be adding to this list as the day goes on.)

Barack Obama ‏-- I'm honored and grateful that we have a chance to finish what we started. Our work begins today. Let's go. -bo

Eric Cantor, House majority leader ‏-- This is a great day for all Americans to celebrate and to remember that the Capitol belongs to all.

Sandra Lee ‏-- OK #inaug2013 watchers, who is that handsome teenaged boy making eyes at Malia Obama? #VeryCute

Omar L. Gallaga ‏ -- I opened for Beyoncé." -- something inaugural poet Richard Blanco gets to say forever. #inaug2013

StevieG the truth -- Obama's being inaugurated, it's Martin Luther King Day and Beyonce's singing the anthem. Black folk are having the best Monday EVER.
