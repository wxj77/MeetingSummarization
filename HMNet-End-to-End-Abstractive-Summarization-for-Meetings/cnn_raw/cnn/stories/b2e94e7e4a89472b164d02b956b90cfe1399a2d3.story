Oreo lovers have long debated how to eat them:  twisted, dunked, creme first or bite whole.

But most have never calculated just how stuffed Oreos are, until now

A high school math teacher in upstate New York tasked his students to find out just how much "stuf" is in each type of Oreo -- original, Double and Mega Stuf.

"Most of them have had practice, as have I, in separating the Oreo in half and getting a clean side, but getting two clean sides off just leaving the stuff was difficult," said teacher Dan Anderson.

Oreo: Original vs. Double vs. Mega

Here's how they did it.

The students weighed 10 of each type of sandwich cookie -- original, Double and Mega.  They also weighed the wafers separately, without the creme

Subtract the weight of the wafer from the total weight of the cookie, and you get the stuff!

The results:  shocking, if you can say such a thing about a cookie revelation.

Anderson's students discovered that those cookies we love so much, aren't all they're stuffed up to be.

Double Stuf?  Not really.  Try 1.86 times the stuff of a regular Oreo.  Mega Stuf?  Try again.  How about 2.68 times the stuff.

"We were very surprised," Anderson said.

And it apparently would be a surprise to the folks at Oreo too.

"While I'm not familiar with what was done in the classroom setting, I can confirm for you that our recipe for the Oreo Double Stuf cookie has double the stuff, or creme filling, when compared with our base, or original Oreo cookie," said Oreo spokeswoman Kimberly Fontes.

This isn't the first time a food favorite has come under fire for not measuring up.

Watch:  Subway's footlong doesn't add up

Last year a Subway customer's photo went viral. It showed his foot-long sub only measured 11 inches.

Subway said at the time that foot-long was "a descriptive name for the sub and not intended to be a measurement of length."
