Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)  -- America's top diplomat to Kenya has announced that the United States has suspended a $7 million "capacity building" program for the country's Ministry of Education, citing corruption.

"The United States shares the deep concern of Kenya's development partners and the Kenyan people regarding the continuous revelations of large-scale corruption," Ambassador Michael Ranneberger said in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Nairobi, Kenya.

The announcement comes after allegations of major corruption in the country's much-praised free schooling campaign for primary education.

"Those culpable for the fraud should not merely be sacked, they should be prosecuted and put behind bars," said the U.S. ambassador.

The United States, Britain and other major donor governments have recently become increasingly vocal in their criticism of corruption and the slow pace of reform in Kenya.
