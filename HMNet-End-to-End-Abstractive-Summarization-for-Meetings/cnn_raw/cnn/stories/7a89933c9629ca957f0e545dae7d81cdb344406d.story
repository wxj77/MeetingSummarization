(EW.com) -- Demi Moore finally settled on a new Twitter handle, letting go of the @mrskutcher name that she used to grow popular on the social networking site.

After announcing her split from Ashton Kutcher last November, the actress left Twitter for a while. But she recently resurfaced and asked for help in determining a new handle. As of today, Moore decided that her followers will now know her as "justdemi."

"So hard finding a name that was fun somewhat playful and available. So for now it will be @justdemi It could grow on me!" she wrote on her account.

It sounds like Ms. Moore is flexible about her choice â€” so it could change again. And for a woman who still goes by her first husband's last name, we're surprised she made such a big deal about what she's called on Twitter.

Although we are still hoping she'll change her mind and go with @theexmrswillis.
