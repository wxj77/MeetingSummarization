(EW) -- The big-screen "Scream" franchise could be coming to MTV. The cable network has greenlit a pilot based on the films.

MTV and Dimension Films' one-hour pilot will attempt to reinvent the 1996 horror-comedy that spawned three sequels.

MTV also announced a third season of "Snooki & JWoww," along with three new series:

-- Docu-drama "Generation Cryo" "explores the issues faced by a new generation of kids coming of age who were conceived via anonymous sperm donors and are redefining what it means to be a family."

-- "Nurse Nation" (working title) is a new docu-series that follows nine 20-something travel nurses all assigned to work at a new hospital in a brand new city for 13 weeks.

-- "The Hook Up" (working title), hosted by Andrew Schulz of MTV2's series "Guy Code," is a weekday afternoon dating show where singles looking for a match will choose from four potential suitors based on their social media history.
