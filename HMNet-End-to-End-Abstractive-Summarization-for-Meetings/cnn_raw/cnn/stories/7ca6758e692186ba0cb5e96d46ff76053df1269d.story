(CNN) -- Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood was released on bail Thursday after being arrested on suspicion of domestic assault.

The 62-year-old was arrested near his home in southern England on Wednesday and spent the night in police custody before being released.

"I can confirm that there was an incident last night and that Ronnie Wood was arrested," a spokesman for the musician said, adding that he did not have any further details.

As the case is under investigation, police have said little. They have not stated who filed the assault complaint .

Wood will face police questioning again in January.

The assault charge follows Wood's highly publicized divorce last month from his wife of 24 years, Jo, on grounds of adultery. The divorce settlement set Wood back an estimated Â£6.5 million ($10.7 million). He and Jo have two children.

Wood has reportedly been dating a 20-year-old Russian cocktail waitress, Ekaterina Ivanova, for a year.
