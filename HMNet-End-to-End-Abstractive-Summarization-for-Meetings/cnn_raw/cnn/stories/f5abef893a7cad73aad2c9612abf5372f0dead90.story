(EW.com) -- There were several jaw-dropping plot twists on the most recent season of "Mad Men," but the one that arguably left fans dangling the most was the exit of Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) from Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

Every other character on the show who has left Don Draper's ad agency has either never been heard from again, or revisited in a one-off episode and then rarely to never heard from again. Peggy, by contrast, had been such an integral part of the show's exploration of the 1960s that the thought of completely losing her â€” and the Emmy-nominated Moss â€” had some fans in a wee bit of a snit. (Of course, Moss' appearance in the final moments of the season finale certainly suggested that Peggy's story was not complete, but why let that get in the way of wild speculation?)

Well, worry no more! In an interview with TV Line, Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner makes clear that Peggy, and Moss, still have a future on the series.

"When people leave Sterling Cooper, sometimes it is the end for [the character]," Weiner said. "But I will spoil that one tiny piece of anticipation and tell people that Elisabeth will be showing up to work."

Weiner wasn't kidding, though, when he said he'd only spoil a tiny bit.

He declined to illuminate how much Moss will be appearing in the show's sixth season, let alone in what capacity she would be on the show. (He was clear, though, that the show will have a sixth and seventh season.) So for now, we'll just have to let our own fertile imaginations conjure up where Peggy's upward mobility could take her.
