(CNN) -- Pippa Mann is hoping to make history after becoming the first female British driver to enter the prestigious Indianapolis 500 race.

The Londoner is among 42 entries for the 100th anniversary of the U.S. motorsport event next month, and joins three other women vying for one of 33 available grid slots.

2010 IndyCar Rookie of the Year Simona De Silvestro of Switzerland, Brazilian Ana Beatriz and American Danica Patrick will also be among competitors going through a series of qualifying tests the week before the May 29 race.

The 27-year-old Mann will make her debut in the 500-mile IZOD IndyCar Series, it was announced on Tuesday, driving the number 36 car for the Conquest Racing team at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

Mann, who made her first test in an IndyCar in March, will be joined by Colombian driver Sebastian Saavedra to complete Conquest Racing's line-up for the event.

"I'm really excited to be entering the Indy 500," Mann told CNN. "Obviously it's always good to be the first to do something. If I can encourage other British women to compete at this level, then that's an added bonus.

"There are a lot of entries for the race this year, so it's a somewhat interesting time to be a rookie, but my qualifying record on super speedways is good and I'm definitely up for the challenge."

Conquest Racing team owner Eric Bachelart said Mann is a "natural" on oval track racing, and proved her competency when she tested for Conquest in Texas earlier this year.

Mann was the 2010 Freedom 100 pole-sitter, and the first and only woman to win a pole position at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

The U.S. resident joins the IZOD IndyCar Series following a successful Firestone Indy Lights campaign with Sam Schmidt Motorsports in 2010, where Mann earned three pole positions, finishing fifth in the drivers' championship.
