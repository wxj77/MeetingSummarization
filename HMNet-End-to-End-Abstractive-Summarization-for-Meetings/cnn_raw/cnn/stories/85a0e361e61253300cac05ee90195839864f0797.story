(CNN) -- Chelsea target Fernando Torres has submitted a transfer request at Liverpool, but the English Premier League club still insist he is staying with them.

With the hours ticking down until the end of the January transfer window, Liverpool signaled their intent to hold on to their star striker, who signed a new five-year contract with them in 2009.

"Fernando Torres tonight submitted a written transfer request, which has been rejected by Liverpool," said a club statement Friday night.

"Fernando is under long-term contract and the club expect him to honor the commitment he made to Liverpool FC and its supporters when he signed the agreement."

Earlier, the Merseyside club confirmed on its website that a bid had been received -- reported in British newspaper the Daily Telegraph to be around $63 million -- but it is expected reigning Premier League champions Chelsea will increase their offer ahead of Monday's deadline day.

The 26-year-old striker, who was part of Spain's World Cup winning squad in South Africa, has scored nine goals this season and under new manager Kenny Dalglish looks to be returning to his best form.

Liverpool, up to a season's best seventh after a midweek win over Fulham, have strengthened their squad with the signing of Uruguay striker Luis Suarez from Ajax to play up front with Torres.

But Chelsea, trailing leaders Manchester United in this season's title race, are also keen to augment their aging squad, particularly in attack.

Spanish club Atletico Madrid said they had turned down Chelsea's $82 million bid for Argentina striker Sergio Aguero earlier this week.
