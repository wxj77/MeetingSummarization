(CNN) -- Police are looking for the husband of a bride who was found stabbed to death in her bathtub on Sunday. She was still in the sequined cocktail dress she wore to her wedding reception, police said.

Authorities in the Chicago suburb of Burbank, Illinois, are looking for Arnoldo Jimenez, 30, on a first-degree murder warrant in the death of Estrella Carrera, 26. Jimenez is still at large, police said.

Jimenez and Carrera were married on Friday at City Hall in Chicago, according to authorities. Carrera's cousin, Sandy Lopez, told CNN affiliate WBBM the couple had been together for three years.

They celebrated their union with family and friends with dinner and a limo ride to at least one nightclub, according to police. The newlyweds were dropped off around 4 a.m. on Saturday, and proceeded home, police said.

"She was happy. She was fine. Did nothing out of the ordinary at all," Lopez told WBBM.

On Saturday relatives called police to say Carrera had failed to pick up her children, ages 2 and 8, police said Monday.

Police later found Carrera, wearing the same dress she wore at her reception, dead in the bathtub of her home.

There were no signs of forced entry, police said.

"(I)t is important to know that this appears to be an isolated incident stemming from a domestic situation and the investigation is continuing," police said Monday, before obtaining the warrant.

Lopez told WBBM she had "no idea why somebody would do this to her."

Jimenez was last seen driving a black 2006 Maserati.

Burbank Police, in conjunction with the South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force, continue to investigate the case.

The police department did not immediately return a telephone call Tuesday seeking comment.
