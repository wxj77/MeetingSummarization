(CNN) -- The International Olympic Committee (IOC) have opted not to re-award the women's 100m gold medal at the Sydney Games in 2000, which was stripped from Marion Jones two years ago.

In line with IOC practice, controversial Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou, who finished second to Jones in Sydney, would have been expected to receive the gold medal.

Instead, the record books will show no gold in the women's sprint at Sydney but two silvers, with third-placed finisher Tanya Lawrence of Jamaica promoted to silver alongside Thanou.

Lawrence's compatriot Merlene Ottey was awarded a bronze medal instead of fourth place.

It is believed to be the first time in the modern history of the Games that an Olympic event will not have a gold medallist.

"The actual awarding of a gold medal, of any medal, is certainly not a right and therefore in this case it will not happen," IOC spokesman Mark Adams told reporters.

Adams underlined Thanou's more recent problems, notably evading anti-doping tests in 2004, in which, "she disgraced herself."

"It's felt that with her conduct she didn't deserve to be honored with this recognition," he said.

Jones' 200m gold went to Pauline Davis-Thompson of the Bahamas with Sri Lanka's Susanthika Jayasinghe moving up into second and Jamaica's Beverly McDonald stepping onto the podium with bronze.

Jones was stripped of all her medals she won nine years ago after admitting doping offences, and was sent to prison in the United States after lying to federal investigators.
