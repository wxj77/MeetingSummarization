(CNN) -- Venezeula has decided not to embalm the body of its late president, Hugo Chavez, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said on Friday in a Twitter message.

The initial plan was to have Chavez's embalmed body displayed much like the remains of former revolutionary leaders Vladimir Lenin of Russia and China's Mao Zedong. But the embalming was ruled out, Villegas said, after a report from a Russian medical panel.

"The Russian medical commission established that in order to do the procedure, the body would have to be transported to Russia and remain there for seven to eight months," he said.

Scientists in a preliminary assessment have determined that the process might be "quite difficult," acting President Nicolas Maduro said Wednesday.

Scientists will study possible Chavez poisoning

He said at the opening of the Book Fair of Venezuela that scientists argued that "the decision should have been taken much earlier."

Chavez died this month, at 58, after a battle with cancer.

Venezuelan elections are scheduled for April 14.
