(CNN) -- A python has killed a security guard near a luxury hotel in Bali, Indonesia.

A doctor told CNN that a man's corpse was brought to the RSUP Sanglah Denpasar Hospital in Bali on Friday. A large snake appears to have suffocated the man, said the doctor, who did not wish to be identified.

The body has been released to the family, the doctor said.

The python remains on the loose after strangling the guard, who was trying to capture the large snake, according to Agence France-Presse.

Another security guard, at the Bali Hyatt, saw the attack, which took place "on the roadway outside of the hotel's property," Jamie Zimmerman Rothfeld, a spokeswoman for the Bali Hyatt, told CNN.

"The management team and hotel associates of Bali Hyatt express their sincere condolences to the family of the victim of the python attack," she said.

Rothfeld declined further comment, saying the hotel is under renovation and closed until 2015. She referred more details on the attack and search for the snake to local authorities, who could not be reached for comment.
