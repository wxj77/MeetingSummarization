(CNN Student News) -- April 25, 2014

From the U.S. to Brazil, this Friday's edition of CNN Student News covers headlines that have people talking. Leaping across the pond, we tell you how an iconic theater is paying homage to its most famous playwright. And modern robots might look nothing like R2-D2, but they're still helping fight crime and save lives.
