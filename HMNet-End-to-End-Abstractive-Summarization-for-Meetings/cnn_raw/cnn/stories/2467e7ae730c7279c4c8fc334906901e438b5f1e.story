(CNN) -- Dutch star Arjen Robben hasn't given up hope of playing in the World Cup after he was diagnosed with a hamstring tear.

The Bayern Munich winger was injured during the Netherlands warm-up match against Hungary on Saturday.

Scans revealed Robben has a small tear in his left hamstring but he is confident that intense physiotherapy can help salvage his dream of playing in South Africa.

He told reporters: "On Sunday I had the scan and it's just a small tear in my left hamstring. It's the first time I have a injury on that spot of my leg.

"If I just let it heal then I'm back on the field in four to six weeks, but we don't have so much time. I have one chance and I have to go for it.

"(Physio) Dick van Toorn is going to help me. We're going to work incredibly hard. I'm going to fight until I drop. The last 24 hours I have had so much support from all the people around me and that had a positive effect on me.

"After the injury I went to the locker room for a first diagnosis which was very difficult. But it was clear that it wasn't good because I had a lot of pain."

Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk has already confirmed he doesn't intend to call up a replacement for Robben in order to give him as much time as possible to recover.

The Netherlands are in Group E along with Denmark, Japan and Cameroon. Their first game is against Denmark on June 14.
