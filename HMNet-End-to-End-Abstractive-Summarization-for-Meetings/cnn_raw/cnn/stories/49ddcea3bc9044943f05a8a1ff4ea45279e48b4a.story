(EW.com) -- In animation, the next best thing to a grand vision is crack comic timing.

The third chapter in the saga of Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) and his Central Park Zoo pals â€” now nostalgic for New York after their foray into Africa â€” has timing up the wazoo.

It's there in a (literally) over-the-top chase through the skies of Monte Carlo, in the grouchy fun of a troupe of Euro circus animals our heroes hook up with, and in bits like Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) singing a circus jingle inspired by his psychedelic Afro wig.

The story in "Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted" is functional, but the antically civilized spirit is infectious. B+
