Fatal naval skirmishes took place near the inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea in 1999, 2002 and 2009.

And in 2010, Seoul accused Pyongyang of sinking one of its naval vessels near disputed waters off North Korea, killing 46 South Korean sailors. North Korea has repeatedly denied responsibility for causing the sinking.

South Korea is a key ally of the United States, with tens of thousands of U.S. troops stationed in the country.
