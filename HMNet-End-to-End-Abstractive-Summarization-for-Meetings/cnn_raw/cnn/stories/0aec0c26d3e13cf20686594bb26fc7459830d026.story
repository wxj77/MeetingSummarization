(CNN) -- Argentina's David Nalbandian and Eduardo Schwank kept Argentina's Davis Cup dreams alive after they thrashed Spain's Feliciano Lopez and Fernando Verdasco in the doubles rubber 6-4 6-2 6-3 in Seville on Saturday.

Trailing 2-0 after Friday's singles matches, Argentina had to win Saturday's only rubber to stop Spain from claiming their fifth win in the competition.

Fighting Ferrer give Spain commanding lead

Nalbandian and Schwank never looked in any trouble throughout the match, breaking in the fifth game of the first set before racing into a 4-0 lead in the second.

Spain's only two chances to break came in the sixth game of the third set but both times Nalbandian denied them.

Argentina now trail Spain 2-1. If they win both singles rubbers on Sunday they will become the first team in 72 years to win the David Cup from 2-0 down.

Juan Martin Del Potro will face Rafael Nadal in the first singles match while Nalbadian is scheduled to face David Ferrer.
