Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani politician and his bodyguard were killed Monday in a suicide attack in northwest Pakistan, a police official told CNN.

Hanif Jadoon had just finished morning prayers on the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha when a bomber approached his car and detonated his explosives, police official Muhammad Ejaz Khan said. The attack took place in the Swabi district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Islamabad.

Jadoon was a member of the Awami National Party, a secular party often targeted by the Taliban.

Nine others were injured in the attack.

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, police said.
