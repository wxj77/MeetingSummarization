Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan authorities have arrested two suspects accused of shooting U.S. officials in a strip club earlier this year.

Prosecutors charged Carlos Mejias Blanco and Windy Fabiani Mejias with attempted murder, alleging that they got into a fight with two U.S. embassy officials at the club and opened fire, "leaving them wounded," Venezuela's Information Ministry said in a statement Tuesday.

Police said the May shooting occurred in the early morning hours at the Antonella 2012 club, located in the basement of a mall in northeast Caracas. Mall security said the establishment is a strip club.

In May, the U.S. State Department said two members of the embassy suffered non-life-threatening injuries but did not provide details.

The injured officials worked with the embassy's defense liaison office, according to two U.S. officials who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.
