(Rolling Stone) -- The Sonisphere Knebworth festival, which was to host performances by Kiss, Marilyn Manson and a version of Queen fronted by Adam Lambert, has been cancelled.

According to organizers, plans for the event -- which was to be held in Stevenage, England on July 6-8-- were scrapped due to unforeseen difficulties.

"It is with very heavy hearts and much regret that we announce the cancellation of Sonisphere Knebworth 2012," reads a statement on the festival's website. "Putting the festival together in what is proving to be a very challenging year was more difficult than we anticipated. Unfortunately circumstances have dictated that we would be unable to run the festival to a standard that both the artists and that Sonisphere's audience would rightly expect."

Other Sonisphere festivals, including events in Poland, Spain and Swizterland, will go on as planned with Metallica as a headliner. It is unclear how the cancellation of the festival will affect the touring plans of other bands on the bill, which also included Evanescence, Faith No More, Flogging Molly, Mastodon, Andrew W.K., Incubus and the Darkness.

The Sonisphere Knebworth festival is the only date scheduled for a Queen performance featuring Lambert. As of yet, neither Lambert or Queen have commented on the possibility of making alternate plans.
