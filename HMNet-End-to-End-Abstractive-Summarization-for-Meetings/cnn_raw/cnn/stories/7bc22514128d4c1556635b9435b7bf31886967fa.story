Los Angeles (CNN) -- Just hours after Taye Diggs walked the red carpet and was a presenter at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, the actor tackled a burglar at his home, police said.

Diggs, who plays a doctor on ABC's "Private Practice," returned to his Studio City home from the SAG ceremonies Sunday night to find a man in his garage "looking for items to steal," a Los Angeles police spokesman said Monday.

The burglar ran from the home, but Diggs caught up with him down the street and tackled him, Detective Gus Villanueva said.

Diggs detained the man until officers from the LAPD's North Hollywood division arrived to take him into custody, Villanueva said.

Suspect Hassan Juma, 20, was jailed and charged with burglary, he said.
