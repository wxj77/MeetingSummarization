(CNN)  -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been charged with improper conduct by the English Football Association (FA) after his angry disagreement with a match official following his side's 1-1 draw against Sunderland.

Arsenal appeared set for three points at the Stadium of Light on Saturday as they led 1-0 deep into injury time.

But the home side equalized through Darren Bent 15 seconds after the end of the allotted four minutes of extra time.

Clearly furious, Wenger confronted fourth official Martin Atkinson and appeared to shove him in the back.

The Frenchman faces an Â£8,000 ($12, 440) fine and one-match touchline ban if he accepts the charge under the FA's new fast-track disciplinary process.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been charged with using insulting and/or abusive language and behavior amounting to improper conduct," a statement on the FA's official website read.

Wenger has until Thursday September 23 to respond to the charge and could opt for the case to be heard by a disciplinary panel.

On Saturday he was unrepentant about his actions.

"Take the pictures and look at it. I complained to nobody," Wenger insisted in the post-match press conference.

Meanwhile, Cesc Fabregas, who scored Arsenal's freak opener at the Stadium of Light, but then limped off injured could make a quick return to action.

The Spain World Cup hero told his official Twitter account: "Good news on my injury.

"I have some fluid but nothing bad in the muscle. I hope I can be playing in two weeks."

Fabregas has been in inspirational form in Arsenal's strong start to the season, putting close season speculation of a move to Barcelona behind him.
