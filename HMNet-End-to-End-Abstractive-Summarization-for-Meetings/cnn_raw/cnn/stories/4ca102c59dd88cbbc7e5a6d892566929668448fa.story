"Respecting God's laws and honoring the sacred laws of Islam are of the utmost importance to Steel Azin and unfortunately these matters have not been adhered to by the named player," the report said.

The club also accused Karimi, 31,  of insulting Iranian Football Federation officials.

According to Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency, Karimi denied any wrongdoing of that he had insulted Iran's Football Federation.

"I am a Muslim and I do respect Islam," Karimi said, according to ISNA.

After a four-year stint with UAE-based side Al-Ahli Karimi moved to Bundesliga side Bayern Munich where he played in the title-winning side led by Felix Magath.

Karimi grew into a pivotal attacker for Iran's national team, becoming the second most capped player in the sides' history and scoring 36 goals in 112 appearances.
