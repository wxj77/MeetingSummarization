(EW.com) -- With Martin Luther King Jr. Day right around the corner, Oliver Stone announced Friday that he is no longer on board to write and direct a biopic about the Civil Rights leader.

Stone took to Twitter to explain that his rewrite of the script, which dealt with "issues of adultery, conflicts within the movement, and King's spiritual transformation" was not well received by producers. It's unclear how or if Stone's leaving will affect Jamie Foxx, who was attached to star in the DreamWorks and Warner Bros production.

EW reached out to Stone and the studios for further comment, but had not heard back at press time.

Read Stone's explanation below, ending with a note to King himself:
