(CNN) -- Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo both scored hat-tricks as Real Madrid thrashed Levante 8-0 in the first leg of their Spanish Copa del Rey last-16 tie on Wednesday.

Jose Mourinho's side, who have not won this cup competition since 1993, scored four goals in each half to make the second leg in January a formality.

Mezut Ozil and Pedro Leon, who added the final goal in the 90th minute, were also on target as Mourinho's near full-strength side ouclassed their opponents.

Real could face Atletico Madrid in the quarterfinals after their city rivals took a narrow 1-0 first-leg lead into the second leg against Espanyol, despite the first-half dismissal of former Spain international Jose Antonio Reyes.
