An altercation at a Texas community college Wednesday afternoon escalated to gunshots and a campus lockdown but no injuries were reported and a suspect was captured, according to officials at Victoria College in Victoria, Texas.

College President Tom Butler told CNN that students were playing basketball in the college sports center when the incident occurred.

"It was not an official game," Butler said. "There was an altercation. I don't really know the motive, but an individual who's not currently a student did fire some shots and then ran from the building."

The sparsely populated campus was put on lockdown with students and personnel altered by e-mail and texts, but Butler said a suspect was "pretty quickly apprehended ... about 10 minutes after he fired the shots, actually."

"No one was hurt," Butler said. "No one was hit in the fire.

The suspect's name was not released pending booking at the Victoria County jail.
