(Mashable) -- Windows 7 is now the world's most popular desktop operating system, according to the August report from Net Applications.

In August, Windows 7 had a 42.76% market share, a fraction of a point more than Windows XP's 42.52%. Windows XP was released in 2001.

The much-maligned Windows Vista sits at third place with a 6.15% market share, followed by Mac OS X 10.7 and Mac OS X 10.6 with 2.45% and 2.38%, respectively.

All in all, older versions included, Microsoft controls some 92% of the market.

It took three years for Windows 7 to become the world's most popular OS. Microsoft's desktop operating system, which was launched in October 2009, will soon be replaced by a newer version â€” Windows 8.

Windows 8, which is scheduled to go on sale on October 26, will be Microsoft's first operating system designed to work just as well on tablets as it does on desktop computers.

Users running Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 will be able to upgrade to Windows 8 Professional for $39.99 via an online download.
