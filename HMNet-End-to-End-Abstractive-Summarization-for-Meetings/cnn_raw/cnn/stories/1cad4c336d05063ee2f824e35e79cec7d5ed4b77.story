(EW.com) -- The ladies of Litchfield really are a family: The cast and crew of Netflix's Orange Is the New Black has banded together to raise funds for series costar Michelle Hurst, who suffered serious injuries in a car accident in December.

Hurst â€” who plays Miss Claudette on Orange â€” "had major injuries so the doctors put her in a medically induced coma to avoid movement while they did multiple surgeries near her spine," the team explains on a fundraising page for their comrade.

"She is out of the coma (after 16 days) and has opened her eyes! We can't send flowers yet because she is in ICU at UNC Chapel Hill Hospital. So we have set up a fundraising page," the text continues. "All the money will go through Michelle's sister to help pay for her medical expenses & time off of work." The page has already exceeded its fundraising goal of $5,000.
