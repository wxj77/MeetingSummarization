(CNN) -- Opener Shane Watson hammered a world record 15 sixes in a one-day innings as he helped Australia defeat Bangladesh by nine wickets in their second one-day international in Dhaka.

Watson, who went on to make a career-best 185 not out, also smashed 15 fours in his 96-ball innings, as Australia needed just 26 overs to reach 232-1 in reply the hosts' 229-7 in their 50 overs.

The all-rounder bettered by three the previous sixes mark of 12 held by Xavier Marshall of the West Indies against Canada in 2008.

The 29-year-old also broke the record for the most runs scored via boundaries (150) in a single innings, beating the previous mark of 126 set by South African Herschelle Gibbs.

Watson's innings was also the highest by an Australian in one-day internationals, beating the 181 not out by Matthew Hayden.

"It was a nice day today as everything came off," Watson told reporters. "I had no idea of the sixes record.

"I was pretty tired and didn't want to run too much. It was hot and humid, so I tried to limit my running and it worked out nicely."

Australian captain Michael Clarke added: "That's probably the best innings I've ever seen. He hit the ball so cleanly from the start."

The third and final one-day international will be played in Dhaka on Wednesday with the visitors unbeatable with a 2-0 lead.
