(CNN) -- DC Comics' Wonder Woman has gotten a makeover.

For the character's big-screen debut in Zack Snyder's "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," the familiar red, blue and gold costume has been traded in for a bronzed ensemble with matching thigh-high boots.

The new look was unveiled at San Diego Comic-Con on Saturday, with director Snyder sharing the first photo of actress Gal Gadot as the Amazon princess.

Some fans have been thrilled, saying Wonder Woman's costume was due for an update.

"Not the classic costume, but interesting," one observer noted on Facebook.

"That looks like Wonder Woman to me!" tweeted another. "Gal looks phenomenal."

Other fans have been vocally disappointed, dismissing the costume as too "Xena: Warrior Princess" and the actress as too petite to portray the fierce fighter Diana Prince.

"Not impressed," said one commenter on DC Comics' Facebook page. "Colors are too muted. Nothing about this says Wonder Woman."

"Where is the powerful, strong Wonder Woman we all love?" asked another fan on Facebook. "She looks way too small."

Lynda Carter, who played Wonder Woman on TV in the '70s, hasn't voiced her opinion on the new costume -- but she did ask her fans to weigh in. (The verdict? "She's no Lynda!")

Gadot hasn't been the only "Batman v Superman" star to suffer critics. Her co-star Ben Affleck had the lion's share when he was brought on to play Batman.

That criticism didn't stem the excitement at Comic-Con on Saturday when Affleck arrived at the "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" panel along with Gadot and Henry Cavill, who plays Superman. Although "Batman v Superman" is still in production, those present did get a taste of what's to come.

Also starring Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor and Jeremy Irons as Alfred, "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" will open May 6, 2016.
