(PEOPLE.com) -- Michelle Duggar, star of TLC's "18 Kids and Counting," was rushed to an Arkansas hospital over the weekend -- but her pregnancy with Baby No. 19, not due until spring, wasn't the reason for her dash to the doctor.

"This weekend, Michelle Duggar was admitted to an Arkansas hospital due to gallbladder issues," said a network rep.

"The pain from a gallstone was generating some contractions. Just to be safe, she was airlifted a Little Rock, Arkansas, hospital, so that in the unlikely event that she had to be delivered early, she would be close to a NICU center," the representative said. "Though there were some fears that the baby was in trouble initially, it soon was discovered to be solely the gallstone causing the discomfort. Michelle is resting comfortably, and the baby is doing fine."

For now, Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar's brood of 18 kids will have to get by without Mom at home.

"Doctors want to observe Michelle in the hospital for the next couple of days," said the rep, "but it would appear that the pain medication they have given her for the gallstone has worked, and there is no need for immediate surgery. The hope is that any necessary surgery can be delayed until after she delivers."

The physician attending Duggar, Dr. Curtis Lowery of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, told PEOPLE, "We have every reason at present to expect that mother and baby will proceed with a healthy pregnancy. Mrs. Duggar is in good spirits and feeling much better."
