Washington (CNN) -- Bristol Palin describes being dragged through the grass and called a series of obscenities during a massive brawl last month in recordings of Anchorage police interviews that CNN obtained through a public records request.

She said she jumped into a fight after "some old lady" pushed her sister, Willow Palin, because "oh f***in' hell no, no one's gonna touch my sister."

When she tried to find the woman, though, she said a man who others identified as Korey Klingenmeyer, the owner of the house where the party took place, knocked her down.

"A guy comes out of nowhere and pushes me on the ground, takes me by my feet in my dress -- in my thong dress in front of everybody -- [and says] 'Come on you c***, get the f*** out of here. Come on you s***, get the f*** out of here," she said.

No charges were filed as a result of the September brawl.

Other people interviewed by police described the Palins as instigators in a brawl that also reportedly included Track Palin and his father, Todd, fighting several men.

They said Bristol Palin punched Klingenmeyer several times before he restrained her.

Klingenmeyer said he'd approached Todd Palin to say that "your daughter's out of line" and that he should get the situation under control. That didn't happen.

"I told 'em all to get the hell out of here and go home," he said.

He said the altercation with Bristol Palin started after she insisted she was going to beat another woman up.

"I said 'this is my house, we're not having this,'" Klingenmeyer said. "She freakin' goes, 'I'll kick your a**.'"

He said Bristol Palin punched him several times, and then he grabbed her fist, made a motion that isn't described verbally, and then she "fell down."

Sarah Palin can apparently be heard in the background during some of the interviews. At one point, she complained that her children were being "made to feel like the bad guys."

She also criticizes Klingenmeyer, saying: "What would he be doin' pushin' girls around, though?"

Matthew McKenna, whose birthday was the reason for the party, told police that people had gotten "drunk and stupid" -- and that he had video of the altercation, but wouldn't share it.

"I know everyone here, and it's just an unfortunate deal," he said.
