New York (CNN) -- The 27-year-old son of tennis great John McEnroe and Academy Award-winning actress Tatum O'Neal was arrested on drug charges in Manhattan, police said.

Kevin McEnroe was arrested late Tuesday after what police believed was a drug transaction on a street corner in East Village, according to New York police Sgt. Jessica McRorie. He was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance.

McEnroe was carrying six clear plastic bags of what was believed to be cocaine, a Clorazepate anxiety pill, 20 Oxycodone pain-killing pills, 10 morphine pills and 10 orange pills which were not identified, McRorie said.

McEnroe was arraigned Wednesday in Manhattan Criminal Court. Prosecutors asked that bail be set at $5,000 but a judge released McEnroe on his own recognizance. He is to appear in court on October 16.

His lawyer, Isabelle Kirshner, declined to comment.

A second man also was arrested, a law enforcement official said

McEnroe's mother, Tatum O'Neal, was arrested in 2008 on misdemeanor drug possession charges in Manhattan after allegedly buying crack cocaine.

O'Neal, who wrote a 2004 memoir about her long road to sobriety, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.

At 10, she won an Oscar for best supporting actress in the movie "Paper Moon." She is the daughter of actor Ryan O'Neal, who starred in the 1973 film. She is the ex-wife of McEnroe, with whom she has three children.
