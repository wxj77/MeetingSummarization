(CNN Student News) -- April 16, 2014

A city pays tribute to the men and women who embody the phrase "Boston Strong" on the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon terrorist bombings. Dr. Sanjay Gupta shows us how scientists testing for Ebola have to protect themselves against the deadly virus. And a week-long event celebrates the value and contributions of America's libraries.

Media Literacy Question of the Day:

How might news coverage of the anniversary of a tragedy impact viewers?

Key Concepts: Identify or explain these subjects you heard about in today's show:

1. vaccine

2. FAFSA

3. National Library Week

Fast Facts: How well were you listening to today's program?

1. What city's marathon was struck by terrorist bombings one year ago? How did some there observe the one-year anniversary of this tragedy?

2. What are some precautions that scientists take when handling blood samples that could contain the Ebola virus? Why do they have to go to these lengths to protect themselves? Where would the samples have to be tested a few years ago? What were some of the problems associated with transporting the samples so far away?

3. What is a FAFSA? What institutions use this information, and for what purpose?

4. What is an AUV? How is the AUV "Bluefin-21" helping investigators who are searching for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370? How are oceanographers benefitting from this search? Why haven't they been able to do this kind of research on their own? According to the video: What is one potential obstacle to those looking for the plane? How does this obstacle present an opportunity for scientists?

Discussion Questions:

1. In your opinion, what are some ways to honor the memory of victims of a terrorist attack?

2. What kinds of information do you think that oceanographers may be able to learn as a result of the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370? If you were a scientist, what questions would you like to see answered? How might scientists use the search to make a case for greater ocean exploration?

3. In the video, we hear that a recent survey indicated that 94 percent of respondents said that having a library in their community improves their lives, yet just over half of those polled said people don't need libraries as much as they used to. Is there a public library in your community? If so, how often do you go there? Do you think having a public library improves your community's quality of life? State your rationale.
