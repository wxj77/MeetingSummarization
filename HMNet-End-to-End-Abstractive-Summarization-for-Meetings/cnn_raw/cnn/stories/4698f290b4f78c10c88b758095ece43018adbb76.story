(CNN) -- Formula One's main protagonists are used to living under the glare of the paparazzi's flash bulbs but they have turned the tables to raise money for charity.

Red Bull's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari ace Fernando Alonso are some of the big names who have got behind the lens to take a personal snapshot of their lives.

Prints of these signed photographs will go under the hammer at the Zoom auction in central London Friday in aid of the Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity.

"The money raised will make a real difference to patients and families from across the UK," said the charity's spokesman Olivia Jary.

Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone commented: "We are proud to be able to help with the tremendous work they do."
