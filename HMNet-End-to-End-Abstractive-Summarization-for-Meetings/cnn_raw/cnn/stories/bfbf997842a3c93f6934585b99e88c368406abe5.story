(CNN) -- Good news, ladies (and gentlemen): Country star Jason Aldean is extending his sold-out Burn It Down Tour into 2015.

The second leg of the tour will kick off in Greenville, South Carolina, on February 12, and Aldean will travel through Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee before heading to an additional 16 states across the country.

The singer has chosen Tyler Farr and Cole Swindell as his opening acts. Farr is probably best known for his hit single, "Redneck Crazy," though "Whisky in My Water" and "A Guy Walks Into a Bar" have also done well on the charts.

Swindell's "Chillin' It," released on his debut album in February, made him a recognizable name, and the singer has opened for Luke Bryan on several occasions. Swindell, like Aldean, is from the state of Georgia.

"When you're out on the road for as long as we are and playing as many dates as we are, you want to be out there with guys that you enjoy hanging out with," Aldean told Rolling Stone. "I get to go traveling and hang out with my boys for a year."

Aldean's "Old Boots, New Dirt" album hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and broke the record for most first-day and first-week streams by a country album on Spotify, according to the magazine.
