(CNN) -- The Maracana suffered its second fan 'invasion' in the space of four days as Chilean fans tried to storm the stadium ahead of their team's key World Cup group game against Spain.

Fans without tickets tried to force entry into the stadium, breaking fences and overrunning security, while also damaging the media center.

"They did not make it to the seats," said a FIFA statement Wednesday. "The situation was brought under control quickly and at least 85 intruders were detained by the military police of Rio de Janeiro.

"The organizers of the 2014 FIFA World Cup condemn these acts of violence. We'll communicate further information and measures to be taken in due course."

CNN anchor Alex Thomas posted pictures on Instagram of a shattered glass door as well as damage to the media center.

On Sunday, Argentina fans, both with and without tickets, invaded Gate D of the Maracana stadium ahead of their team's 2-1 World Cup win over Bosnia-Herzegovina in Group F.

An O Globo video showed fans in Argentina shirts climbing a wall and running through an open gate before stadium staff were able to close it.

"Nine Argentinian supporters were put into custody by the public authorities," FIFA told CNN.

Chile won the Group B game 2-0 dumping world champions Spain out the finals.

The Maracana stadium will host the World Cup final on July 13.
