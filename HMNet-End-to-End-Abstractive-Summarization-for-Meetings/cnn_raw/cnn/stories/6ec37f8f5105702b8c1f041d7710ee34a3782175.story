(CNN) -- Spread across nearly 3,500 square miles and home to some 60 animal species and almost half of the world's geysers, visitors could explore Yellowstone National Park for weeks and not see everything in the country's first national park.

Parents seem to agree the park in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming is a don't-miss spot in the United States: Yellowstone was named the top "favorite family destination" and top "nature escape" in FamilyFun magazine's first travel awards.

FamilyFun surveyed some 2,000 U.S. moms with children ages 3 to 12, asking the adults to rate 360 popular destinations. The destinations were divided into regions (West, Midwest, South and Northeast) with parents voting within their respective geographic area. Fun, accessibility and affordability were key elements of the survey.

"Most families only have a few weeks of vacation each year, so the choice of where to go and what to see really carries a lot of weight," said Ann Hallock, editor-in-chief of FamilyFun magazine. "The great thing about our list is that the winners in each region are chosen by families who actually live there, so you know you're getting the real scoop on what's going to be fun."
