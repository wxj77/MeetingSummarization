Charles (Chad) Holliday, CEO of DuPont since 1999

After receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Tennessee, he joined DuPont as an intern engineer in the summer of 1970 at DuPont's Old Hickory site.

In 2004, Holliday was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering and became chairman of the Business Roundtable's Task Force for Environment, Technology and Economy.

He is also past chairman of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), The Business Council and the Society of Chemical Industry -- American Section.

While chairman of the WBCSD, Holliday co-authored the book "Walking the Talk," which details the business case for sustainable development and corporate responsibility.

Today, Chad Holliday is chair of the Board of Directors of Catalyst, chairman of the U.S. Council on Competitiveness and a founding member of the International Business Council.

Under Holliday's executive direction, DuPont established the mission to achieve sustainable growth by increasing shareholder and societal value while decreasing the company's environmental footprint.

As a result, DuPont has moved from being a chemical company to being a science-based products and services company.
