(CNN) -- When it comes to dealing with allergies, many sufferers rely on home remedies to ease their symptoms.

iReporter Kristin Carroll says she carries a roll of toilet paper during allergy season to deal with the sniffles.

IReporter Kristin Carroll, a student at Indiana University and self-described lifelong allergy sufferer, offered these hints that have worked for her over the years.

CARROLL: "Every season change, I prepare for (and cope with) my inevitable mucus-fest in a variety of different ways.

Aside from a trip to the doctor, I tend to up my vitamin-C intake. It's a natural antihistamine.

Cayenne pepper is an older trick. iReport: Tell us your allergy remedies

I'm a singer, and in high-school, if I was sick before a competition, I would drink tea with cayenne pepper, honey, and a little lemon.  Watch more of Kristin's tips Â»

The pepper de-sensitizes the mucosa lining your airways, so they won't secrete extra nastiness or enflame when irritated.

The tea is not as disgusting as it sounds; I actually hate spicy-anything but still use the pepper trick when I'm feeling like dirt.

And it never hurts to eat more green veggies -- they're a great source of bioflavonoids -- which is quite the mouthful.

But when combined with vitamin-C, it proves to be an unbeatable combination for vastly reducing histamines."
