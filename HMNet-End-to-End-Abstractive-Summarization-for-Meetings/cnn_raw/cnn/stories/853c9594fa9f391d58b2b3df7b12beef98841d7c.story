(CNN) -- Country music singer-songwriter Brad Paisley was examined and released from a hospital after taking a nasty spill during a South Carolina concert Saturday, the entertainer says on his Web site and Twitter account.

"I hit hard," Paisley wrote on Twitter. "And I mean freaking hard."

Paisley was examined at Medical University of South Carolina Hospital in Charleston and released Sunday.

"Tnx4 prayers,after my fall,I was just discharged from the hospital.Just very very bruised. Nothing broken, had a ct scan all is okay!" he said on his Twitter account, @paisleyofficial.

Paisley was on the final note of an encore finale, a song titled "Alcohol," when he fell, his Web site says.

"If ur wondering,it was the last song&last night of the tour&I was running fast on stage,tripped.really did think I broke a rib or something," Paisley wrote.

He also posted two photos of himself posing with medical personnel while he was being treated at the hospital emergency room.

Paisley was able to complete the show after his fall.

"[H]e bounced back up, finished the show and thanked the audience and told them good-bye," his Web site said Sunday. "Once he left the stage he was transported to the local hospital via ambulance to be checked out -- all is well, only badly bruised. Brad was discharged from the hospital and is on his way home to Nashville."

Paisley, 37, was making his final stop of the "American Saturday Night Tour" at the Charleston Coliseum.

He won his third consecutive Country Music Association Male Vocalist Award in November, his 13th prize from the organization.
