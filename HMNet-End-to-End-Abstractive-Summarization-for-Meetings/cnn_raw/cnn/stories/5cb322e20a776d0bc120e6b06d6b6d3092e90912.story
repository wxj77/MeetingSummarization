(CNN) -- When it comes to taxis, London reigns supreme.

For the sixth year in a row, the city's iconic black cabs were voted best in the world in a survey by Hotels.com.

More than 2,500 voters from 30 countries took part in the annual global taxi survey, giving London 22% of the votes -- well ahead of runners up New York City (10%) and Tokyo (9%).

Rounding out the top five, Berlin came in fourth place with 5% of the vote, while Madrid, Mexico City and Amsterdam came in joint fifth with 4%.

"Of the 30 countries surveyed, London topped the list across five of the seven categories, including cleanliness (23%), knowledge of the area (27%) and quality of driving (30%)," said Hotels.com.

Almost a quarter of respondents (23%) voted safety as their number one taxi priority, which London's cabs also ranked highest on.

New York's yellow taxis grabbed the top spot for availability (23%).

New York and Bangkok taxis tied for first in terms of value for money (20%). Despite this recognition, Thailand's capital failed to crack the top five this year.

Survey categories ranked in order of preference by voters: safety (23%); value (20%); knowledge of area (17%); availability (14%); quality of driving (11%); cleanliness (8%); and friendliness (7%.)

If any cabbies are reading, that suggests most travelers would prefer their drivers keep their mouths shut during the ride.
