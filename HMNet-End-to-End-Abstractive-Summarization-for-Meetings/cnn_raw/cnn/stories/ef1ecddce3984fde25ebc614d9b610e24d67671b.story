(CNN) -- Officers arrested the son of legendary actor Clark Gable this week on suspicion of drunken driving after he crashed into six parked cars in Malibu, California.

John Clark Gable, 52, was driving a white Ford pickup Tuesday near the Malibu Pier when the crashes occurred, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported.

No one was injured, but Gable was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, and hit-and-run.

It isn't the first time an heir of the "Gone With the Wind" actor has been in trouble with the law.

In 2011, Clark Gable's grandson, then 22, was accused of pointing a laser inside the cockpit of a Los Angeles police helicopter, endangering the pilot who was flying over Hollywood.

Police arrested Clark James Gable and charged him with a felony. He later was sentenced to 10 days in jail, CNN affiliate KTLA-TV in Los Angeles reported.

At the time, his manager said it was an accident.

"Boys will be boys, and he was playing with what he thought was a toy and not a felony piece," Roxane Davis, the manager, told CNN then. "From what he told me from jail, he had it out the window, and he was shining it out the window, and the next thing he knew was that he had a spotlight on him."

Clark Gable, once dubbed the King of the Hollywood, is probably best known for his portrayal of Rhett Butler in the 1939 classic "Gone With the Wind."

He died in 1960. John Clark Gable was born four months after his father's death.
