The father of 15-year-old Jared Padgett does not understand what compelled his son to open fire at his Oregon school.

Padgett killed one student this week at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, about 12 miles east of Portland. He also injured a teacher, before turning the gun on himself.

"I, Michael Padgett and my ex-wife, Kristina, are grieved in our hearts for the tragic event that involved our beloved son Jared at Reynolds High School. We are finding it very difficult to put into words our state of mind and emotions," the father wrote in a letter he gave to CNN affiliate KPTV.

He offered condolences to the family of the student his son killed, 14-year-old Emilio Hoffman, and apologized to the teacher.

Authorities have said there is no known link between Padgett and his victims. They have declined to comment on a possible motive.

"We are at a loss as to how and why this tragedy unfolded. Our family does not condone and has never promoted violence or hatred toward anyone," Padgett's father wrote.

"The values that we have taught our children are love in Jesus Christ, compassion, forgiveness, and patience. These were all natural attributes we observed within Jared daily.

"Knowing that these are the values that we have taught our children, we are horrified and distraught by the actions perpetrated by our son," he said.
