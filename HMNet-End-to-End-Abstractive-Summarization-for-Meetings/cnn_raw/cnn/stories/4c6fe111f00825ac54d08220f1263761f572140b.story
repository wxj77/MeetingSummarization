(CNN) -- British athletics star Paula Radcliffe has confirmed that she will have a second child this year, but still plans to run at her home Olympics in London in 2012.

The women's marathon world record-holder, who will miss this month's London race for the fifth year in a row, expects to give birth in September.

"We're very pleased," the 36-year-old told the UK Press Association on Friday. "We are very lucky that everything so far has worked out as we had hoped.

"As always, when nature is involved it's very hard to plan, but the idea was that we could get pregnant this year and have 2011 to comfortably come back to racing.

"I plan to run through as before but to come back a bit slower than last time, when I was back a bit too quickly."

Radcliffe had her first child, daughter Isla, with husband Gary Lough in January 2007, but has since struggled to regain the heights of earlier in her career.

She set the marathon record in London in 2003 and was world champion in 2005, but finished only 23rd at the 2008 Beijing Olympics after suffering injuries in the preceding months.

A fractured toe ruined her buildup to last year's world championships in Berlin and she subsequently made herself unavailable for selection, then a knee injury saw her finish only fourth at the 2009 New York Marathon where she been seeking a third consecutive victory.

Radcliffe has not competed since then, but PA reported that she is still training full-time and recently trained with top American runners in the United States.
