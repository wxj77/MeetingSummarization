(CNN) -- "Saturday Night Live" has added a little perspective to users' gripes about the new iPhone.

In a biting sketch on Saturday's episode, Christina Applegate hosts a fake talk show in which three tech bloggers voice complaints about the iPhone 5: Its new maps are glitchy, its camera takes purple-tinged photos, its casing scratches too easily, and so on.

Then Applegate reveals -- surprise! -- three other guests: "workers" from factories in China that manufacture Apple's phones and other consumer electronics under allegedly inhumane conditions.

"It takes you to wrong place?" says a factory worker played by "SNL" cast member Fred Armisen in response to a complaint about Apple's buggy mobile maps. "You want Starbucks, it takes you to Dunkin' Donuts? That must be so hard for you."

This "First World problem" sarcasm, spoken in over-the-top fake Chinese accents, continues after another blogger mentions apps loading slowly on the new phone.

"Oh, Twitter real slow? You can't read Kardashian tweet about handbag?" says another worker. "My brother have handbag, too. He lose hand, keep in bag until he can afford to reattach."

(There's no mention by name of Foxconn, the controversial Taiwanese manufacturer whose China factories produce the phones. A series of suicides by workers at Foxconn's plants have raised questions about living and working conditions there.)

On "SNL," the three bloggers grow more apologetic and uncomfortable until the skit ends with Applegate inviting the Chinese workers to complain about an American product.

"Let's see -- what does America make?" says Armisen's character. "Does diabetes count as a product?"
