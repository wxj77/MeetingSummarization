(CNN) -- Traffic on Interstate 15 in Southern California was flowing in both directions early Wednesday after an overpass fire shut down the roadway for more than 24 hours, San Bernardino County said.

The bridge in the city of Hesperia caught fire Monday when sparks from blowtorches used to cut reinforcing bar ignited the wooden framework supporting the structure.

For a day and half, the fire and cleanup clogged the major artery between Los Angeles and Las Vegas while crews put out the fire and demolished the damaged structure, according to Eric Sherwin with the San Bernardino County Fire Department.

Hesperia is about 60 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
