(CNN) -- A Chicago police officer processing a burglary scene and another person were fatally shot Friday afternoon, police said.

The officer, an evidence technician, died at 2:30 p.m., one hour after the shootings in the 8100 block of South Burnham Avenue, said Police Superintendent Jody Weis.

Police identified the officer, a father of four, as Michael Flisk, 46.

Another man also died, Weis said, adding there was no information on a motive. The second victim was a retired Chicago Housing Authority officer, CNN affiliate WLS reported.

"The thought that someone can shoot and kill a police officer is unacceptable," Weis said. "We will find those responsible. We shall squeeze that neighborhood and we will find who did this."

The gunman is described as a black male wearing a gray thermal shirt, a blue vest and a gray skull cap, according to WLS.

Flisk was collecting evidence at a garage involved in a burglary, Weis said.

The officer was a 19-year veteran of the police force and is survived by his wife and four children. He also has three siblings serving in the department.

Flisk received 67 awards during his career, police said.

The Chicago Police Memorial Foundation offered a $10,000 reward late Saturday for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whomever killed Flisk.

The officer is the sixth to die in the city this year, according to WLS. Officer David Blake was shot to death inside his car Monday while off duty.
