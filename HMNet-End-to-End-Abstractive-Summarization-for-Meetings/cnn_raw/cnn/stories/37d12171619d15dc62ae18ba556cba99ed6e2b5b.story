Bad weather around Nepal's iconic Mount Everest has stranded more than 1,500 trekkers in the area of a town near the mountain.

Aircraft have been unable to fly in or out of the airport in Lukla, where supplies are limited, according to the U.S. Embassy in Katmandu.

"Stranded tourists may wish to consider the option of trekking down to Jiri, where bus transportation to Kathmandu is available. The Government of Nepal does not plan to evacuate tourists to Kathmandu at this time," the U.S. Embassy said in a statement late last week.

Lukla, located in northeast Nepal, is a popular starting point for people on their way to the world's tallest peak.

Tourists have been stranded there since Tuesday, according to the Xinhua news agency.

"We have our flights on stand-by. As soon as the weather visibility improves, our teams are ready for rescue," said Nepal Army Brigadier General Ramindra Chhetri, Xinhua reported.
