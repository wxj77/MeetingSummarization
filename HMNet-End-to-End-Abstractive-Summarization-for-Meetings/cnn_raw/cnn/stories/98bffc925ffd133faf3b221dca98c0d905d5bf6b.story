Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- A command post set up to investigate the disappearance of missing Missouri girl Lisa Irwin has been shut down, Kansas City police said Wednesday.

Investigators are back in their usual offices, but Detective Kevin Boehm said the case is still open and police continue to work on it.

Police told CNN affiliate KCTV that investigators also have to focus their attention on child abuse and neglect cases that have come in since Lisa's disappearance. But, they said, eight detectives remain assigned to the case.

Lisa, 1, has been missing since October 4, after her father arrived home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and a window tampered with. The girl's mother said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the previous day.

Dozens of investigators, including police and FBI personnel, have conducted numerous searches for the missing girl -- but have come up empty.
