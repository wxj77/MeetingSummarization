LONDON, England  -- UEFA banned Poland's Legia Warsaw from European competition for two seasons on Wednesday in response to "ugly and shocking" crowd scenes during an Intertoto Cup match.

Police horses have to disperse the crowd during Sunday's unsavory scenes.

UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body announced that Legia would be thrown out of this season's competition and also barred from an additional European campaign should they qualify within the next five years.

Legia were trailing 2-0 away to Lithuanian team Vetra Vilnius in Sunday's second round, first leg match when Polish fans embarked on a halftime rampage, attacking police with metal bars and stones and causing damage to the stadium.

European football's governing body said the abandoned match would be turned into a 3-0 victory for Vetra who will go on to face English side Blackburn Rovers in the third round.

Legia have also been ordered by to arrange compensation with Vetra in regard to the stadium damage.

Although Legia have promised to crack down on fans involved in Sunday's violence, the disciplinary body noted that this was not the first time it had dealt with the Polish club.

The latest incidents occurred just 10 weeks after Poland were awarded the right by UEFA to co-host the 2012 European championship finals with Ukraine.

"Legia must react quickly and firmly if the club wishes to participate in UEFA competition in future," the disciplinary body concluded.

"With Legia's considerable disciplinary record for away matches, the duty of playing matches against Legia becomes a tall order that UEFA cannot afford to support any longer."

The club has until Saturday to appeal against the UEFA decision. E-mail to a friend
