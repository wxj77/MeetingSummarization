With all due respect, thanks but no thanks.

That's the message from the Children's Hospital Los Angeles after it was deluged with pizzas.

It started all when Lauren Hammersley taped a message to the hospital room window of her 2-year-old daughter Hazel, a cancer patient.

"Send Pizza. RM 4112."

On Saturday, a Reddit user took a picture of the window from the street.

And word spread. Fast.

Reddit users, who have a longstanding mission to "restore faith in humanity, one slice at a time" with their "Random Acts of Pizza," delivered.

They leapt in to action for Hazel Hammersley.

One pizza arrived. Then another. And another.

By the time more than 20 pizzas had been delivered, the hospital had to issue a statement on their website, urging everyone to stop.

"You've made a little girl very happy but NO MORE PIZZA IS NEEDED," the hospital said.

"The Hammersley family will be going to bed very full and very thankful for the compassion they received today."

Hazel was diagnosed in April with Stage 3 neuroblastoma, a type of cancer found predominantly in young children and infants. She will soon begin her fifth round of chemotherapy treatment.

On her blog "Our Little Hazelnut," mother Lauren Hammersley wrote: "We have been absolutely humbled and surprised by the outpouring of love and support from the online community and can only hope and pray that this brings awareness to Neuroblastoma and the Childhood Cancer Community."

She also said the family was able to share in the fun with other families in their ward.

"Several other children and nurses came into the room, with music playing, and had themselves a wonderful Pizza Party," she said.

It was a sight that melted hearts like mozzarella.
