(CNN) -- Johnson & Johnson announced Friday it is voluntarily recalling a single lot of Aveeno Baby Calming Comfort Lotion after a test by the Food and Drug Administration found it contained more of a form of bacteria than specifications allow.

"That test indicated that the lot exceeded the specifications for common bacteria, though extensive testing by an independent laboratory afterward did not show that specifications were exceeded," the company said in a news release. "However, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies Inc. has voluntarily initiated this recall out of an abundance of caution. This action is not being undertaken on the basis of adverse events and the potential for adverse health effects is remote."

The company identified the bacteria as coagulase-negative Staphylococci, which it described as a family of bacteria that naturally occurs in the environment. "These are common bacteria often found on the skin and scalp of babies and adults, and found in commonly used household and cosmetic products, at very low levels," it said. It did not release the amount that was detected.

The lot number, embossed on the tube, is 0161LK. The product was distributed in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, the company said. It urged consumers who would like a refund to call 877-298-2525.

But Johnson & Johnson Vice President of Communications Bonnie Jacobs said the recall is being carried out at the retail level, and consumers who have bought the affected product can still use it. "They do not have to take any action," she said.

The company's news release described the potential for the lotion to adversely affect one's health as "remote."

The 2,200 tubes in the lot that is being recalled were produced by a third-party manufacturer in Canada, she said. It did not identify the company.
