R. Kelly hopes you'll write him back

The R&B singer was on his way to New York to be on "The Jimmy Fallon Show" and NBC's "Today" when he became ill and decided to seek medical treatment in his hometown, a statement from the singer said Wednesday.

"Initial indications are that he is suffering from complications from surgery he had last year to treat an abscess on his vocal cords," the statement said.

Along with the television show cancellations, a Manhattan party to promote his memoir "SoulaCoaster" was postponed.

"It is unclear how long Kelly may be sidelined," the statement said.
