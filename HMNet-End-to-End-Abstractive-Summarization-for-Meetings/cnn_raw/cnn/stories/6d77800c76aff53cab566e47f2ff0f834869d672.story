(CNN) -- A new coloring book aims to build an appreciation for elder connoisseurs of fashion.

"Advanced Style: The Coloring Book" is based on the popular street fashion blog of the same name featuring stylish senior citizens around the globe.

"Advanced Style" creator and editor Ari Cohen collaborated with illustrator Ilan Schraer on the book of 30 drawings, which are based on photographs from the blog.

The blog has earned a large following of fashionistas of all ages. The duo hopes the coloring book, intended for ages 1 to 100+, will bring the blog's message that "aging is positive and older people are cool" to a younger audience.

"There is so much to learn and appreciate from their years of life experience; old age is something to be celebrated, not bemoaned," Schraer said. "This book puts those ideas in the hands of an even younger audience."

Schraer, a high school friend of Cohen's from San Diego, liked the idea of challenging people's expectations "in a medium generally associated with children."

"The men and women on Ari's blog are such inspiring people and with their unique style. They just cry out to be drawn."

Schraer, who, like Cohen, is close with his grandparents, said the project came naturally.

"I do a lot of detailed portraiture in my work, and I wanted to see if I could transfer that over into the simplified line work you commonly see in coloring books."

The duo hopes the book will give children and their grandparents something to share. After all, in addition to the coloring pages, cutout doll and connect-the-dots images, it also has crossword puzzles and interviews.

As for kids, maybe it'll inspire their style, Schraer said, "for their own golden years."

The book is set to release September 3.
