Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's need for a better toothpaste should not outshine more important issues "such as homelessness, lack of funding for public education and relations between America and its allies," the actress's rep said Friday.

Steve Honig was responding to online buzz about a close up photo of Lohan's teeth that appear to show stains that bloggers blame on her love of red wine and cigarettes.

"Lindsay is widely recognized as one of the most beautiful women on the planet, and is regularly sought-after by some of the top photographers in the world to appear on covers of magazines around the globe," Honig said in a statement to CNN.

Not to mention the many paparazzi that hound Lohan through the streets of Los Angeles.

"There are so many more important issues the media should be focusing on, such as homelessness, lack of funding for public education and relations between America and its allies," Honig said.

Stained teeth, however, is not Lohan's biggest concern now. She is due back in court Wednesday morning for a status hearing before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Saunter.

Judge Saunter will check on her progress in meeting the community service and psychological counseling requirements she imposed last summer when she sentenced Lohan to probation for stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store.

As with Lohan's smile, there are online reports that her record of probation compliance is stained and that Lohan again faces jail time.

But Frank Mateljan, spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney, said that while he has seen the reports the matter "not risen to the level of having our office involved yet."

The probation office and the court have not contacted the prosecutor on the case about it, Mateljan said.

Lohan lawyer Shawn Holley would not comment on the reports.
