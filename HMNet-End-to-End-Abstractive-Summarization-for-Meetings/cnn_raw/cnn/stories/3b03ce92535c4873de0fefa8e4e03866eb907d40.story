(CNN) -- Google Inc. will refund at least $19 million to consumers over complaints it unfairly billed for charges incurred by children using mobile apps downloaded to Android mobile devices from the Google Play app store.

The settlement was announced by the Federal Trade Commission Thursday.

The company also agreed to modify its billing practices to ensure that it obtains customers' consent before charging for items sold in mobile apps.

The settlement is the latest seeking to address a growing problem of the digital age -- the ability of children to make purchases without their parents' knowledge.
