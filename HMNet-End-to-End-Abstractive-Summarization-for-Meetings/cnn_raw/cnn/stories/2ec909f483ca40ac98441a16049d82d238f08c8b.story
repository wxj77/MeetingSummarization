(CNN) -- Yes, it was a fact. But no, it wasn't fun. Not for E! and especially not for Michael J. Fox.

The entertainment network laid an egg on the red carpet Sunday in its lead up to the Golden Globe Awards when it listed Fox's 1991 diagnosis with Parkinson's disease as a "Fun Fact." The graphic appeared on E!'s Internet coverage, not on television.

"We regret the insensitive classification of Michael J Fox's Parkinson's diagnosis during our E online live stream," the network said. "We understand the serious nature of the disease and sincerely apologize."

Fox appeared on the red carpet with his wife Tracy Pollen. He was nominated for best actor in a comedy for his new NBC show, "The Michael J. Fox Show."

The 52-year-old actor first rose to fame in the early 1980s in the sitcom "Family Ties," before starring in the "Back to the Future" trilogy and the "Spin City" TV series.

As his Parkinson's progressed, Fox continued to act, although less regularly until his TV show debuted in the fall. He had recurring roles on "Boston Legal" and "The Good Wife."
