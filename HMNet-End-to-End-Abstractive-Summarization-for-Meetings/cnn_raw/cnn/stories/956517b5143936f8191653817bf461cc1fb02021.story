(EW) -- Looks like the mercurial Jay Gatsby will remain mysteriously out of reach for a bit longer.

Warner Bros. announced today that "The Great Gatsby," director Baz Luhrmann's 3-D adaptation of the seminal novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, has been pushed to Summer 2013.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role, along with Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, and Joel Edgerton, the film had been slated to open on Christmas day this year. No specific new date was indicated.

In announcing the change, Warner Bros. president of distribution Dan Fellman lauded Luhrmann's singular visual style. "We think moviegoers of all ages are going to embrace it, and it makes sense to ensure this unique film reaches the largest audience possible," he said in a statement.

International distribution chief Veronika Kwan Vanderberg added that the studio believes "The Great Gatsby" "will be the perfect summer movie around the world."

The film would have gone head to head with Quentin Tarantino's "Django Unchained," which also stars DiCaprio in a supporting role as the cruel owner of a plantation in the pre-Civil War south.
