(RollingStone.com) -- Colin Farrell has just filled in one piece of the "True Detective" casting puzzle by confirming that he'll be joining the HBO series for its second season.

The actor shared the news in an interview with The Sunday World (via Buzzfeed). "I'm doing the second series," he told the Irish newspaper. "I'm so excited."

Farrell noted that the remaining roles were still being locked in as he dropped a few more details about the production.

"I know it will be eight episodes and take around four or five months to shoot," he said. "I know very little about it, but we're shooting in the environs of Los Angeles which is great. It means I get to stay at home and see the kids."

'True Detective' creator 'halfway' through season 2 scripts

HBO has not yet confirmed the casting news, and other details of the production remain a mystery. Elisabeth Moss, Rachel McAdams, Vince Vaughn and Taylor Kitsch are all rumored to be interested or involved in some way.

Series creator Nic Pizzolato has previously revealed that the second season of the series, set in a fictional California town, would be about "hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system."
