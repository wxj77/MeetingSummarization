(EW.com) -- There was a chance that two fewer Emmys would be handed out during the telecast this year — until now.

On Thursday, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Board of Governors reversed its decision to consolidate the Outstanding Lead and Supporting categories for actors and actresses in movies and miniseries.

Last year, the board -- in hopes of streamlining the annual telecast and making it, well, less boring — voted to reduce the total number of categories by eliminating two of the telefilm actor categories.

But production of movies and miniseries has since increased (hi, "The Bible!") so the board reversed its decision. So this year, there will be four categories for Outstanding Lead Actor and Actress, and Supporting Actor and Actresses.

Reducing the number of categories during the three-hour telecast has long been the goal of the Big Four networks, which pay for the privilege of broadcasting the kudofest — even though many of the golden statues go to premium and basic cable recipients each year. The miniseries categories, in particular, have been dominated by cable actors.

The entry deadline for the 2013 Primetime Emmy Awards is Friday, May. Nominations will be announced on July 18 for the telecast that'll air on CBS Sept. 22.
