(CNN) -- A Blue Ribbon Panel of distinguished leaders and humanitarians -- including Gen. Colin Powell, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Elton John -- has selected 2009's Top 10 CNN Heroes.

CNN will announce the 2009 CNN Hero of the Year and honor the Top 10 CNN Heroes in a star-studded gala celebration, "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute" on Thanksgiving, November 26, from the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.

Also among the Blue Ribbon Panelists is Malaak Compton-Rock, founder and director of The Angelrock Project, an online e-village that promotes volunteerism, social responsibility and sustainable change.

"Being a panelist is really special," Compton-Rock told CNN's Anderson Cooper. "This happens to be my favorite awards show -- not the Emmys, not the Oscars, not the Grammys or the MTV awards -- but this show.

"So, when I got the invitation in the mail, I was ecstatic -- I mean, I ran around the house, I told my husband, I was so excited. It's a privilege to even be in the company of my other panelists, first of all, and to be able to learn so much about people who are changing the world."
