(CNN) -- An extra day once every four years doesn't really give travelers much more time to play, but it's an excuse for the hospitality industry to create special Leap Year travel offers. (Each year is actually 365 days plus about 6 hours. An additional day is added to the calendar every four years to keep the calendar in sync with the seasonal year.)
