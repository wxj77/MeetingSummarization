LONDON, England (CNN) -- A Scottish fish and chip shop visited by Prince William, Robert De Niro and Tom Hanks has been crowned the best place in Britain to eat the national dish.

Robert and Alison Smith, the owners of the Anstrhuther Fishbar  in Fife, celebrate their success.

The UK is in recession, but the nation's traditional takeaway dish is showing no sign of a downturn.

Sales rose at 9,500 chippies in Britain by 1.7 percent last year, according to Seafish, a seafood industry group.

The Anstrhuther Fishbar in Fife, Scotland was crowned the best chippy of 2008 following a rigorous selection procedure that included a customer vote, taste tests and two intense rounds of shop inspections.

"Fish and chip shops are well-placed to prosper in the current economic climate as they offer value for money and a quality product with a feel-good factor," competition judge Andy Gray said.

"Despite the credit crunch, people still want to enjoy small luxuries. Fish and chips are a national institution which have survived the test of time and will be around for many years to come."

Fishbar owner Robert Smith said that the start of 2009 had been the busiest January since the harbor front shop opened in 2003. Smith, who also owns a fish processing business, said dedication was the key to the shop's success.

"We are passionate about our business and we just do it right," he said.

Fish and chips is the most popular hot takeaway in Britain, with 276 million meals eaten every year, according to Seafish figures.
