(CNN Student News) -- November 14, 2013

On World Diabetes Day, CNN Student News examines the disease and its risks, and we meet a NASCAR driver whose diabetes diagnosis didn't send his career off track. We also report on initial Obamacare enrollment statistics, and we hear about a message that the first lady has for students. Plus, we discuss the most talked-about person on the internet.
