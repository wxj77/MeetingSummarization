(CNN) -- Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. was arrested at a Las Vegas casino on a misdemeanor battery charge after he allegedly assaulted a security guard at his housing complex, a police official said Friday.

Mayweather was arrested just before midnight Thursday, police spokeswoman Barbara Morgan said.

He was released from the Clark County Detention Center on Friday, police said, and is expected to appear in court Tuesday, according to Clark County court spokeswoman Jillian Prieto.

Mayweather's legal representation declined to comment.

He last fought in May, beating Shane Mosley, but has since been embroiled in domestic violence claims from his former girlfriend. He faces criminal charges in court in January.

Mayweather is represented by Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions but has been linked with legendary entrepreneur Don King.
