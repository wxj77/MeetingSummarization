James Rebhorn, whose acting resume includes a long list of character roles in major films and TV shows, died Friday, his representative said Sunday.  Rebhorn was 65.

While you may not know his name, Rebhorn's face may be familiar as the arrogant headmaster in Al Pacino's "Scent of a Woman" or the scheming secretary of defense in "Independence Day."

Think back to the series finale of TV's "Seinfeld" in 1998. Rebhorn played the district attorney.

Or perhaps you saw him on the polished crime caper "White Collar," where he played loyal FBI chief Reese Hughes for 16 episodes.

More recently, he was Frank Matheson in eight episodes of "Homeland."

Rebhorn was one of those busy actors sometimes referred to as "that guy." Tall and gangly,  he had a face that served him well as a villain or corrupt politician.

"He died on Friday at home with his loving family in attendance," his representative, Dianne Busch, told CNN.

Other notable film roles were in "My Cousin Vinny" in 1992 and "The Game" in 1997.

His movie career earned Rebhorn an invitation to become a member of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences in 2007.

Rebhorn's early screen acting career including regular roles on several soaps, including "Search for Tomorrow" and "As the World Turns," which earned him an outstanding supporting actor nomination by Soap Opera Digest in 1992, according to the Internet Movie Database.

His stage acting career included membership in New York's Ensemble Studio Theatre.
