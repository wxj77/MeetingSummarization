(CNN) -- At least eight people were killed and 10 wounded when a car bomb exploded Friday outside a mosque in the northern Syria city of Binnish, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Worshippers were leaving the al-Kabeer mosque in the Idlib province city after attending Friday prayers when the bomb went off, the group said.

A YouTube video of the aftermath shows a blown-up car and dark smoke coming from the building. The video was posted by the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists.

CNN cannot independently verify the content of the video.

Well over 100,000 people, including many civilians, have died in Syria's three-year civil war, the United Nations has said. That includes at least 26 killed Friday, according to the Local Coordination Committees.

So far, all attempts to stop the fighting between government forces and rebels seeking President Bashar al-Assad's ouster have failed.

The United Nations on Friday condemned armed groups for cutting off water supplies to the city of Aleppo recently, an action that left 2.5 million people without water. The water supply has since been restored, but in the statement, the U.N. urged all parties in the civil war to ensure water supply to civilians, calling access to safe water a "fundamental human right."
