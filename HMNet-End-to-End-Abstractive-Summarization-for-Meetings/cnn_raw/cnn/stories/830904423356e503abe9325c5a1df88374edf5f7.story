(CNN) -- It's during the rain, sleet and snow of winter that a warm and sunny beach vacation starts to sound particularly alluring.

Which one to choose? Hawaii, Florida, Belize, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Bahamas, St. Kitts, Martinique and Isla Mujeres in Mexico all sound lovely this time of year.

But what do you want when you get there? Romance, a deserted beach, a beach party or child-friendly travel? And can you even afford them? Fodor's 80 Degrees Beach Finder tool can help narrow down the options by location, type and price point.

10 budget all-inclusive resorts

"We know from firsthand experience that not all beaches are a perfect fit for every beach goer," said Arabella Bowen, Fodor's executive editorial director. "You may want to go to a beach but don't know which beach will make your perfect vacation. Do you want somewhere remote and quiet, water sports, a lively nightlife scene, shopping or family friendly?"

The Fodor's beach finder tool matches beaches with travelers' interests and budgets and offers hotel and restaurant choices to fit within those parameters.

What do the dollar signs mean? If you want a hotel room for $150 or less per night, choose the $ option. For $250 or less per night, choose the $$ option. For $350 per night or less, choose the $$$ option. For more than $350 per night, choose the $$$$ option.
