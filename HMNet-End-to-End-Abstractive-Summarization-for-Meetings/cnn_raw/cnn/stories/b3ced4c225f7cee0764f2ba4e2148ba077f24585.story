LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson's music sales keep soaring as fans purchased more than 800,000 of his albums last week, Billboard magazine said.

Fans sign a memorial wall for Michael Jackson this week near the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California.

Jackson's albums hold all 10 top positions on Billboard's top pop catalog albums chart, according Nielsen SoundScan sales data released Wednesday.

That feat broke a record Jackson set last week when he had eight albums on that chart.

Jackson's albums are not eligible for the Billboard 200 chart, which is for newer albums.

Jackson's "Number Ones" sold a whooping 339,000 copies last week. Two other Jackson albums, "Thriller" and "The Essential Michael Jackson," sold more than 150,000 copies.  Watch family, friends and fans pay tribute Â»

Physical albums constituted 82 percent of Jackson's sales last week -- 656,000 of those versus 144,000 download albums.

Downloads of Jackson's songs dropped last week compared with the week before. Fans downloaded 2.2 million Jackson songs last week compared with 2.6 million the previous week.

But the "King of Pop" still had five singles on the Top 10 list of digital downloads.

Jackson's 1988 hit "Man in the Mirror" was his most popular single, with 159,000 downloads.
