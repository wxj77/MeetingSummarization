(CNN) -- "The Voice's" new winner has put Usher on the scoreboard.

On Tuesday night's "The Voice" finale, the R&B singer's mentee, Josh Kaufman, was crowned the winner of Season 6. Kaufman's victory came in spite of a technical glitch that made it difficult for fans to show their support of him on iTunes, where his performance from Monday night's show was available for download.

"The Voice" lets its viewers vote for their favorite singer through phone, e-mail, text and by downloading songs from the show on iTunes. However, as Kaufman warned his fans on Twitter, his cover of Adele's "Set Fire to the Rain" from Monday's show wasn't showing up where viewers expected.

As a result, "The Voice" host Carson Daly said at the start of Tuesday's finale that all of the iTunes downloads from Monday night's show were being tossed out, but the glitch didn't impact the final results.

Kaufman was up against Christina Grimmie, the Team Adam Levine singer who came in third, and Jake Worthington from Team Blake Shelton, who placed second. For the first time, neither Adam Levine nor Blake Shelton could boast coaching the season's winner, as Kaufman sealed the championship for Team Usher. (Although, to be fair, Kaufman was on Levine's team first.)

Kaufman was at the top of his game during the finale, as he performed a duet with Robin Thicke. The pair of soulful crooners did a rendition of Thicke's new song, "Get Her Back."

And with this being "The Voice," that was (obviously) far from the only performance. The two-hour season closer was packed with guest stars, and featured sets from Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Tim McGraw, OneRepublic and Alabama.

In the fall, "The Voice" will be joined by two new coaches, Pharrell Williams and Gwen Stefani, who will sit alongside mainstays Adam Levine and Blake Shelton.
