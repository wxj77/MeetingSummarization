(CNN) -- As much as 8 feet of snow has fallen in parts of Japan since Sunday, slowing train travel and forcing automaker Toyota to close down 12 factories.

The heavy snow disrupted the bullet train, or Shinkansen, system in central Japan on Sunday and Monday, affecting 67,000 passengers, according to Central Japan Railway.

Snow totals on the ground Monday ranged from nearly 3 feet in Shimane Prefecture to 8 feet in Tottori Prefecture, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller.

Passengers on the bullet train network also suffered delays Monday due to a problem with a computer control system. The failure disrupted traffic for 75 minutes Monday morning, disrupting bullet trains nationwide for most of Monday morning, according to East Japan Railway.

Toyota also had to close 12 factories Monday in Aichi Prefecture as heavy snowfall caused problems getting car parts to the facilities.
