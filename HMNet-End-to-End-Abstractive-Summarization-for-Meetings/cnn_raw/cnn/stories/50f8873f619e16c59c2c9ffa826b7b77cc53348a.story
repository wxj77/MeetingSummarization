(CNN) -- A week before her death, South African model Reeva Steenkamp talked about her secure, blissful environment.

"I woke up in a happy, safe home this morning," she tweeted. "Not everyone did."

Four days after she posted that message, neither did she.

The 29-year-old model was shot dead by her boyfriend at his house in Pretoria. She died on Valentine's Day last year.
