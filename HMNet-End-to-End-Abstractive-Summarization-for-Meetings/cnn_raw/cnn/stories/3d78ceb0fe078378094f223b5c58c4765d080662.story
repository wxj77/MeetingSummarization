(CNN) -- The NBC sitcom "30 Rock" lost some flight attendant fans after actor Alec Baldwin was kicked off an American Airlines flight when he refused to turn off his phone.

The Association of Professional Flight Attendants requested Tuesday that the airline remove the show from all flights after last week's incident at Los Angeles International Airport.

Baldwin was booted off the flight because he refused to turn off his cell phone after the plane's doors were closed for departure, the airline said.

The actor was apparently playing "Words With Friends," a Scrabble-like online game.

"We fully support the flight attendants and the way they handled the situation," spokesman Jeff Pharr said. "The crew responded as they have been thoroughly trained to do so by the FAA as safety professionals onboard the aircraft."

Pharr added that the union would retract its petition if Baldwin issued an apology to the attendants.

"30 Rock," meanwhile, continues to air on some American Airline flights in accordance with its standard programming procedures, airline spokesman Tim Smith said.

The actor mocked American Airlines over the weekend during a cameo appearance on "Saturday Night Live," issuing an apology to himself while dressed as airline "Capt. Steve Rogers."

NBC declined to comment on Tuesday's petition.

Last week's incident prompted a flight delay and triggered a wave of comments on social media about the actor's behavior.

CNN's Julia Talanova and Dan Verello contributed to this report.
