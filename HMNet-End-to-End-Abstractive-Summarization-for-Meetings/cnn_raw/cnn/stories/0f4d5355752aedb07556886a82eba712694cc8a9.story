(CNN) -- The 30th anniversary of "The Ghostbusters" just became sweeter.

In honor of the movie's landmark anniversary this past June, Legacy Recordings is releasing a limited edition vinyl of Ray Parker Jr.'s theme song that comes wrapped in a marshmallow-scented jacket.

Yes, you might still have the "Ghostbusters" soundtrack on a cassette somewhere, but does it smell like marshmallows? That's the important question.

(Obviously, the sugar-scented product is to jog your visual memory of the adorable-but-terrifying Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.)

For those who can't resist the call of a collectible's item that smells like candy, they'll also get Run-DMC's "Ghostbusters" rap on the 12" single.

With a new, rebooted "Ghostbusters" movie on the way, it'll be interesting to see whether either of those classic tracks makes it in to writer/director Paul Feig's new film.

New 'Ghostbusters' to star women

The "Bridesmaids" helmer announced last week that he was working on a third "Ghostbusters" installment that would include some "hilarious women," and confirmed that the project won't be a sequel.

"My favorite thing to do is work with funny women. I was like, what if it was an all-female cast? If they were all women? Suddenly, my mind kind of exploded: that would be really fun," Feig told Entertainment Weekly after his announcement. "And then I thought, well, what if we just make it new? It's not coming into the world that existed before. ... I wanted to come into our world where there's talk of ghosts but they're not really credible, and so what would happen in our world if this happened today?"
