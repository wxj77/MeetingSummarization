London (CNN) -- Prince George will be christened on October 23 at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace, his parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, announced Friday.

The christening will be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby.

Prince George was born July 22 in London.

His parents, Prince William and Catherine, have kept him out of the public eye since he left the hospital a day later.

Media crews from around the world had spent days camped outside the hospital waiting to see the royal baby, who is the great-grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.

The world got its first glimpse of George since then in family photographs released last month. They were taken by Catherine's father, Michael Middleton, in the garden of his Berkshire home.

The baby is third in line for the throne now occupied by the queen. Her son, Charles, would succeed her, followed by his oldest son, William.
