Late last month, rival tribesmen armed with arrows and machetes clashed at dawn, leaving 32 dead, the Red Cross said.

In the December attack, at least 30 more were injured in the clashes between Pokomo and Orma tribes in the district, the Kenya Red Cross said in a statement.

Both sides have engaged in retaliatory clashes in recent months.

It's unclear what triggered the latest clashes, but the two groups have fought for years over grazing rights, land and water sources.

Pokomos are largely farmers while the semi-nomadic Orma tribesmen mostly tend to livestock.

The former have accused the latter of grazing cattle on land that does not belong to them.

Violence between the two escalated after an August confrontation killed more than 50 people in the same region.

Kenya has dispatched hundreds of officers to the area in recent months, but authorities in the east African nation have been criticized for failing to stop the carnage.
