From a terrorist attack in Tunisia to an election update from Israel to an upcoming eclipse over the Faroe Islands, today's show is taking you around the world. We're also featuring a Character Study on a 13-year-old who started working to fight hunger at age 4. And we're looking into the NCAA "March Madness" tournament and its effects on some athletes' class time.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
