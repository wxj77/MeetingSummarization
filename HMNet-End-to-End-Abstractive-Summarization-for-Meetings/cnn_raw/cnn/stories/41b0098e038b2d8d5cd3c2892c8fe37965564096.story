(CNN Student News) -- January 7, 2014

For much of the U.S., the weather outside is frightful. In today's edition of CNN Student News, find out why -- and what exactly a "polar vortex" is. We also provide tips for warding off the flu, and we show you how spoken word is more than a verbal outlet for some teenagers.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum and a place for you to leave feedback.
