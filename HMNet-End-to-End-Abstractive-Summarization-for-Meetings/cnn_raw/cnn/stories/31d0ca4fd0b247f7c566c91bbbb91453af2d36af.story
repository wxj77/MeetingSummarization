(CNN)Children of the 1990s, brace yourselves: One of the decade's most popular boy bands may reunite for Sunday night's "Saturday Night Live" 40th anniversary special.

Showrunners have not officially confirmed that *NSYNC will appear on the star-studded three-hour special. But the boy band's official Twitter account dropped a strong hint on Saturday using the hashtag #SNL40: "Together again... Gee, it's good to be together again."

If true, "Bye Bye Bye" crooners Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and Justin Timberlake would join an all-star lineup that includes Paul McCartney, Kanye West, Taylor Swift and rival 1990s boy band Backstreet Boys.

Timberlake announced his involvement in the show earlier this week in an Instagram showing a "writing session" with SNL alum and "Tonight Show" host Jimmy Fallon.

*NSYNC bandmate Chris Kirkpatrick also indicated on Twitter on Saturday that he was en route to New York while lamenting that the airline "left our bags with tux for tomorrows event."

The bandmates last shared the stage in 2013 when Timberlake received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards.
