(CNN) -- Country music star George Jones has been hospitalized in Nashville for a respiratory infection but is scheduled to be released on Friday, his representatives said.

The 80-year-old performer was to stay overnight Thursday for observation, according to a statement on his website.

Jones began cutting records in the mid-1950s, turning out genre standards like "He Stopped Loving Her Today," "White Lighting" and "She Thinks I Still Care." He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1992.

He was long legendary for the hard living that he depicted in his songs -- and which earned him the nickname "No-Show" among concertgoers. But Jones' last known serious health problems were in 1999, when he survived a car accident that required rescuers to spend two hours cutting him out of his sport-utility vehicle. He developed pneumonia while in the hospital and was placed back on a ventilator, but recovered soon afterward.
