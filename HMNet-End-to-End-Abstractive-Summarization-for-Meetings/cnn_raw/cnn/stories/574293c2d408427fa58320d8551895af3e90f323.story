(CNN) -- Thailand's general election on Sunday pitted the Democrats, led by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, against the opposition Pheu Thai party, led by Yingluck Shinawatra, youngest sister of Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless coup in 2006.

Abhisit on Sunday conceded the election, making Yingluck the country's first female premier.

Below is a timeline tracing highlights of the last 10 years, beginning when Thaksin, then a multibillionaire media tycoon, first took office. He rode to power with populist policies that gained huge support from the rural poor. But Thailand's elite feared his policies would erode their position.

Thaksin was also criticized for his brutal war on drugs, which saw summary executions, and for a heavy-handed response to violence in the Muslim-dominated south.
