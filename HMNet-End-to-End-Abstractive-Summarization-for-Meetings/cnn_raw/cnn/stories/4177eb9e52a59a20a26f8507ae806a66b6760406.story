(CNN) -- Award-winning writer/producer Don Payne, one of the creative minds who contributed to "The Simpsons," died this week at his home in Los Angeles, CNN has confirmed.

According to reports, he lost his battle with bone cancer.

" 'The Simpsons' family is mourning the loss of our dear friend Don Payne," tweeted executive producer Matt Selman on Wednesday. "Don was a gentle soul and a funny, passionate writer. Farewell, Don."

Payne won four Emmys for his work on "The Simpsons," for which he was most recently a consulting producer, according to the Los Angeles Times. One of the episodes he wrote, "Fraudcast News," earned the Paul Selvin Award from the Writers Guild of America in 2005.

He then segued into film with 2006's "My Super Ex-Girlfriend," a comedy that starred Uma Thurman and Luke Wilson. From there, he co-wrote the scripts for "Fantastic 4: The Rise of the Silver Surfer" and "Thor."

"Much to my wife's chagrin, I am a superhero geek," Payne told the L.A. Times in 2006. "Definitely growing up I was into comics and became a comedy writer as an adult, so I put the two things together."

"Thor," "Avengers" and "S.H.I.E.L.D." star Clark Gregg, for one, loved that about him.

"Farewell to the wonderful #DonPayne writer on #Thor and #Thor 2," Gregg tweeted. "gentleman, artist and beautiful fellow geek."

Added "Thor" actress Kat Dennings, "A wonderful, beautiful man has passed away. Don Payne, I am lucky to have known you. You are so missed."
