(CNN) -- Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso secured an emotional victory for Ferrari at their home Italian Grand Prix at Monza on Sunday.

The 29-year-old started from pole position and delighted the "Tifosi" -- the name given to Ferrari's legion of passionate fans -- with a superb drive to finish ahead of world champion Jenson Button, with Felipe Massa third in the second Ferrari.

Button claimed the better start and led for the first 36 laps, but Alonso took the lead following a pit stop and held on for Ferrari's first "home" win in four years.

"That was one of the great wins of my career, so emotional and so special for me and for this team. For me it is there with my Spanish Grand Prix of 2006," Alonso told reporters.

"Now we must go back to work -- we need to find consistency in the last five races of the season," he added.

Alonso's third success of the season, and 24th of his career, saw him close the gap at the top of the world driver standings.

The Spaniard is now on 166 points, 21 points behind new leader Mark Webber -- who overtook McLaren's Lewis Hamilton at the top of the standings despite finishing down in sixth place.

Hamilton crashed out on the first lap, meaning he now trails the Australian Red Bull driver with just five races still to go.

Sebastian Vettel finished fourth despite early engine problems and a remarkable final lap 3.3-second pit-stop.

Nico Rosberg finished fifth for Mercedes, ahead of Webber. Nico Hulkenberg of Williams, Renault driver Robert Kubica, seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher and the second Williams of Rubens Barrichello completed the top 10.
