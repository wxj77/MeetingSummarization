Los Angeles (CNN) -- Law officers in California detained troubled actress Amanda Bynes for a mental health evaluation Monday night, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday.

The 27-year-old actress was "involved in a disturbance in a residential neighborhood" in Thousand Oaks, a city about 40 miles west of Los Angeles, Sheriff's Capt. Don Aguilar said.

The incident began with an emergency call to the fire department that a gas can was burning in a residential driveway at about 8:30 p.m., Ventura County Fire Department Capt. Scott Dettorre said.

Bynes has had her share of legal problems lately. She faces three misdemeanor charges relating to an incident involving a bong allegedly tossed from her Manhattan apartment in May.

She also has a driving under the influence case pending in Southern California, while a pair of separate hit-and-run charges against her were dismissed last year. She was sentenced to three years' probation for driving on a suspended license in May.

A young teenager when she burst on the scene as the lead in Nickelodeon's "The Amanda Show," Bynes also starred alongside Jennie Garth in the sitcom "What I Like About You." She later scored roles in movies, including "Hairspray" and "Easy A."
