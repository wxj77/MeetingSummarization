(CNN) -- Heavy swells were expected along Mexico's Pacific coast as Hurricane Dora strengthed into a Category 2 storm Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said.

Dora was churning in the Pacific Ocean on a path that was moving it parallel to the southwestern Mexican coast, the center said.

The hurricane was about 215 miles off the coast of Lazaro Cardenas, the center said.

It was moving at 17 mph in a west-northwest direction, which placed it on a route outlining the Mexican coast. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the coastal area from Lazaro Cardenas to Cabo Corrientes, the center said.

The storm had maximum sustained winds of 105 mph.

Strengthening of the storm was expected in the next 48 hours, and Dora could become a major hurricane by Wednesday night, the center said.

The storm was expected to produce strong winds and swells that will be felt on the Mexican coast.

"These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," the center said.
