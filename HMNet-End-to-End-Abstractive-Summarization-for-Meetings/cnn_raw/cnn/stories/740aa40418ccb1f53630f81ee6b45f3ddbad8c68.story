(CNN) -- The Oscars can be unpredictable, but one thing is for certain: Each year there will be at least one glaring oversight in the "In Memoriam" montage.

At the 85th Academy Awards on Sunday night, Andy Griffith and Larry Hagman were among the stars left out of the show's annual tribute to the Hollywood folks who passed away in the last year.

With limited time during the 3Â½-hour telecast to commemorate everyone, the academy published a gallery online honoring more than 100 late stars, some of whom weren't included in the reel on the telecast.

Griffith and Hagman both appear in the 114-slide photo gallery. However, "Desperate Housewives" actress Lupe Ontiveros, comedian Phyllis Diller, "The Jeffersons" star Sherman Hemsley and many more are not included.

George Clooney covered the academy's bases while introducing the segment, saying, "So for those friends who are on this list tonight, and many others who aren't, we thank you for the memories."

Soon after, Barbra Streisand took the stage to pay tribute to Oscar-winning composer Marvin Hamlisch by singing "The Way We Were."
