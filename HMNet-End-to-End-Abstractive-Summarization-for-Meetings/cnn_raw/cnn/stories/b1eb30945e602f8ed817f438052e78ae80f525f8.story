Mumbai, India (CNN) -- The only surviving gunman in the 2008 Mumbai attacks will be sentenced Thursday, the judge at his trial said Tuesday.

Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, was convicted Monday of murder, conspiracy, and waging war on India. The prosecution is calling for him to face the death penalty.

More than 160 people were killed in Mumbai during the three-day siege in November 2008, as 10 men attacked buildings including the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station, and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House.

Kasab was photographed holding an assault weapon during the attacks.

India blamed the attacks on the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda.

Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India's parliament. The group denied responsibility.

Indian forces killed nine suspects in the attack. Their bodies were embalmed and kept in a hospital morgue as some local Muslim groups refused to bury them in their graveyards, saying the attackers were not true followers of Islam.

An Indian official in Maharashtra state, where Mumbai is located, has said a burial took place in January this year. He did not give the date or the exact location of what he described as a secret funeral.

Two Indian nationals accused of conspiracy were acquitted in the trial. The prosecutor said he would fight their acquittals.
