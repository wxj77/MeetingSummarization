(CNN) -- Andy Murray is set to step up his rehabilitation program by returning to practice next month.

The World No.4 underwent back surgery in September following a longstanding injury and was forced to pull out of the end of season ATP World Finals in London.

"Rehab is going to plan and he's aiming to be in Miami in mid-November," Murray's spokesman told CNN.

Murray is currently planning to play in an exhibition tournament in Barbados at the end of November before making a competitive return at the ATP 250 event in Brisbane in December.

The two-time grand slam winner has suffered with back injuries throughout his career and was forced to withdraw from this year's French Open in May before going on to triumph at Wimbledon.

Murray's failure to compete at Roland Garros was the first time he had withdrawn from a grand slam tournament since 2007 where a wrist injury prevented him from playing in the French capital.

Last month he failed in the defense of his U.S. Open title, losing out to Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka at the quarterfinals stage in straight sets.

He will hope to return to grand slam action in Australia next January before playing for Great Britain in its Davis Cup tie with the U.S. the following month.
