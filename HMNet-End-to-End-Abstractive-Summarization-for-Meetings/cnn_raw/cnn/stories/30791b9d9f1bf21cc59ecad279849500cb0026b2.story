BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- A cruise ship carrying 122 people was stranded Thursday on the coast of Antarctica after striking ice, officials said.

Mariano Memolli of the Argentina Antarctic Directorate told Argentina's TodoNoticias (TN) Television a naval boat and plane were dispatched to evacuate the passengers of the Ushuaia as a precaution.

The ship, carrying 89 passengers and 33 crew members, was losing fuel and taking on water but was not in danger of sinking, Television C5N reported.

Adm. Daniel Martin, head of the naval base in Ushuaia, Argentina, where a call for help was received from the ship, said the passengers were "in a perfect state of health," and were awaiting the arrival of the Atlantic Dream, a nearby cruise ship, C5N said.

"The weather conditions are not the best" where the ship is, he said. "There are regular winds in the zone with violent gusts." But he said the ship is protected because it is in a strait, and the weather would not affect the arrival of the rescue plane.

The Panamanian-flagged Ushuaia was located about 186 miles (300 kilometers) southwest of Argentina's Marambio naval base in Antarctica.

CNN's Javier Doberti contributed to this story from Buenos Aires.
