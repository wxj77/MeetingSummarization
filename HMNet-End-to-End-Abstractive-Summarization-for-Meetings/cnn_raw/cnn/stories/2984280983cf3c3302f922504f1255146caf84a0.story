(CNN)"Captain America" actor Chris Evans met some "true superheroes" on Saturday at Seattle Children's Hospital in a visit with "Guardians of the Galaxy" star Chris Pratt.

It was their second hospital visit as part of a Super Bowl bet that ended in a win for everyone.

The bet: If Pratt's team -- the Seattle Seahawks -- won the Super Bowl, Evans would visit Seattle Children's Hospital dressed as Captain America. If Evans' team -- the New England Patriots -- won, Pratt would visit Christopher's Haven in Boston dressed as "Guardians of the Galaxy" character Star-Lord, wearing Patriots quarterback Tom Brady's jersey.

Even though the Patriots won, the two Chrises visited both hospitals. Pratt wore his Star-Lord costume to visit Boston Children's Hospital in February, and Evans donned his Captain America duds to visit Seattle Children's on Saturday, bearing gifts in the form of Marvel action figures and accessories.

"Meeting Captain America and Star-Lord is an experience our patients will always remember," Seattle Children's said. "The kids were beyond excited to meet Captain America and Star-Lord."

The superhero actors met Oskar Beechum, 7, who has been at Seattle Children's for four months for epilepsy treatment.

"Meeting them was a nice reprieve for us," Oskar's mom Kelli Beechum said. "So many of our visitors are doctors, and the conversations are medical. I can't wait to watch the Captain America movie with Oskar. It will be like he knows him personally now."

The visit made an impression on Evans, too, who said he felt inspired, blessed and touched after meeting "some TRUE super heroes!"
