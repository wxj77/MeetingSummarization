(Mashable) -- 25.94 seconds. That's how much time it took Melissa Thompson of Salford, England, to type a complex sentence on a Samsung Galaxy S, which makes her the new Guinness World Record holder for fastest typing on a phone.

The sentence for this particular record, as determined by Guinness, reads as follows: "The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human."

Before Thompson, Franklin Page of Seattle held the record, having typed the above sentence in 35.54 seconds earlier this year.

Interestingly enough, Melissa claims she's out of shape as far as texting goes. She used to send a lot of text messages to her boyfriend Chris -- 40 or 50 per day day, she says -- but after they moved in together she hasn't been texting as much.

But when Samsung invited her to have a go at breaking the world record, it turned out her fingers were in better shape than she thought; she texted faster than anyone else and by a large margin.

The new world record still awaits official approval from Guinness, but if it turns out to be legitimate, the title of the world's fastest texter will move from the U.S. to England.
