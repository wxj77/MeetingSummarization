Spin bowlers Harbhajan Singh and Murali Kartik are back in India's squad for the test series against Pakistan.

Harbhajan has been out of test cricket since July 2006.

They are included in a 14-man party for the first two games, in Delhi, starting on November 22 and Calcutta (Kolkata) eight days later.

Harbhajan has not played a test since July 2006, while Kartik has been absent for three years.

They will be expected to support leg-spinner Anil Kumble, who was named as India's new captain last week.

Dinesh Karthik and Wasim Jaffer, who both played in the 1-0 series victory in England during the summer, are in the party and former captain Rahul Dravid is retained after missing the current one-day series against Pakistan.

The squad for the third and final Test against Pakistan, in Bangalore from December 8, will be named later.

India squad:

A Kumble (captain), W Jaffer, D Karthik, R Dravid, S Tendulkar, S Ganguly, V Laxman, Y Singh, MS Dhoni (wkt), H Singh, Z Khan, RP Singh, S Santh, M Kartik.

Pakistan all rounder Shahid Afridi and Indian batsman Gautam Gambhir have been given fines for their on-pitch clash during the third one-day international in Kanpur.

Afridi was fined 95 percent of his match fee and Gambhir 65 percent after appearing before the International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Roshan Mahanama, the ICC announced.

They were charged under two counts of the ICC Code of Conduct relating to conduct unbecoming of their status, which could bring them or the game into disrepute, and the rule relating to "inappropriate and deliberate physical contact between players in the course of play."

Gambhir and Afridi were involved in a heated altercation after they collided, forcing umpire Ian Gould to intervene and separate them.

India won the third game by 46 runs to lead the five-match series 2-1. The fourth game will be played in Gwalior on Thursday. E-mail to a friend
