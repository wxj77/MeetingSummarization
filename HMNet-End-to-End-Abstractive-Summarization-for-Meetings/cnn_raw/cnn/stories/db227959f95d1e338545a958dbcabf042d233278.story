(CNN)Football player Michael Sam, actress and fitness mogul Suzanne Somers and powerhouse singer Patti LaBelle are among the contestants for the new season of "Dancing With the Stars," ABC announced Tuesday morning.

Others competing in the 20th season of the popular reality show include Olympic gymnast Nastia Liukin, Iraq War veteran Noah Galloway, "Shark Tank's" Robert Herjavec, musician Riker Lynch, Carl's Jr. commercial model Charlotte McKinney, LMFAO's Redfoo, "Hunger Games" actress Willow Shields and actress/showbiz progeny Rumer Willis.

Sam became famous as the first openly gay football player drafted by the NFL, though he didn't make a pro team's final roster last year. He still has hopes of a football career, he said on Twitter after the "Dancing" announcement.

Galloway lost his left arm and left leg to an IED attack. He cracked a joke about his abilities on Twitter after the "DWTS" announcement.

Another competitor will be named before the March 16 premiere, ABC said.

Actor Alfonso Ribiero won the show's mirror ball trophy last season.
