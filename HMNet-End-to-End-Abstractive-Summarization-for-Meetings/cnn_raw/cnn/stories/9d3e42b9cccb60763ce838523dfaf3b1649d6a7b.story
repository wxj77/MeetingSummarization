Excellent!

Alex Winter, who played Bill S. Preston Esq. in 1989's "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure" and 1991's "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey," said plans for the pair's third movie are coming along -- and Keanu Reeves, who played Ted "Theodore" Logan, is also on board.

"(Bill and Ted) will be 40-something, and it's all about Bill and Ted grown up, or not grown up," Winter told Yahoo. "It's really sweet and really f***ing funny."

The films star Winter and Reeves as two slacker friends who find out that they're key to a utopian future -- but first they have to pass a history test. In the first film, thanks to the intercession of Rufus (George Carlin), the two travel through history and gather notables such as Napoleon, Genghis Khan and Abraham Lincoln, allowing them to breeze through.

In the second film, the two face off against Death -- though, instead of playing him in a "Seventh Seal"-type chess match, the two choose to challenge Death to games of Battleship and Twister.

The first film was an unlikely success, Winter recalled in April.

"I hate to say it, but we kind of gave up on the movie," Winter told the UK's Guardian. "It was much closer to the chopping block than anyone knows."

Winter didn't say who would take the place of Carlin, who died in 2008, but told Yahoo there will be "many versions of ourselves in this movie."

The bigger challenge, he added, was that the earlier films have such a large fan base and expectations are high.

"The thing we had going against us is that word got out," he explains. "That was kind of a bummer. It just takes a long time to put a movie together. Now we're having to build this thing in public, which is fine. I just feel bad (the fans) have to get dragged through this long, boring, protracted process."

Winter is currently featured in the film "Grand Piano."
