(CNN)  -- Roger Federer regained the title at his hometown tournament in Basle as he beat defending champion Novak Djokovic 6-4 3-6 6-1 in Sunday's final.

Serbian star Djokovic ended a run of three straight titles for Federer when he beat the Swiss maestro in last year's final, but there was to be no repeat.

It was his third win over the second seed in four meetings this year with his only loss in the U.S. Open semifinals at Flushing Meadows.

Federer now has 65 career titles to go fourth in the all-time list, one ahead of American great Pete Sampras.

The St. Jakobshalle arena is certainly a happy hunting ground for the 16-time grand slam champion, winning four of the last five finals at the Swiss Indoors tournament and seven from 11.

He swept through the deciding set for the loss of a single game to wrap up victory in just under two hours.

Federer now heads to the Paris Masters bidding for a hat-trick of tournament titles after winning the Stockholm Open last week. He will be top seed at Bercy in the absence of world number one Rafael Nadal.

Meanwhile at the Valencia Open, Spain's David Ferrer beat compatriot Marcel Granollers 7-5 6-3 in Sunday's final.

The victory boosts Ferrer's chances of claiming one of the three places available for the season-ending ATP Tour Finals in London later this month with the Paris Masters the final counting event for qualification.
