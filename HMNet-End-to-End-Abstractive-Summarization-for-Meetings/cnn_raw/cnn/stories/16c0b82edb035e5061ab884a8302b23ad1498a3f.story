LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Instead of resuming contract talks to prevent a Hollywood movie and TV production shutdown, Screen Actors Guild (SAG) members were in court Tuesday fighting over who should lead those negotiations.

Doug Allen was the executive director of the Screen Actors Guild until he was fired by the board.

SAG's board fired Executive Director Doug Allen and named a new chief negotiator last week amid a bitter division among the actors over the question of calling a strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).

The new negotiators arranged for contract talks to resume Tuesday, after several months of a deadlock, but a faction of union filed a complaint Monday disputing Allen's firing.

"In light of this circumstance, both parties have agreed to a postponement of their meeting and will reschedule at a later date," a SAG statement said.

A Los Angeles judge rejected their request for an injunction, finding "that the notice and application for the injunction, as well as the underlying complaint, were procedurally defective," according to a statement issued Tuesday afternoon by SAG.

The statement said the plaintiffs told the judge they would be back Thursday with amended papers asking for an injunction to restore Allen to the post.

The actors have been working without a contract since June 30. The two sides have been at odds mainly over the amount actors should be paid when their movies or TV shows are distributed on discs or through "new media," such as mobile phones and the Internet.
