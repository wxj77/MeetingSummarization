(Rolling Stone) -- Aerosmith have moved the release date for "Music From Another Dimension," their first album in 11 years, back from August 28th to November 6th, frontman Steven Tyler revealed during a call to Cleveland radio station 100.7 WMMS.

"It's pushed back because too many people are releasing those weeks, and we don't want to step on their release dates," said Tyler. "So we said, 'You know what, we got the goods -- ain't no doubt about [it]. We'll wait a couple months.'"

"Music From Another Dimension" will be the band's first LP since 2001's "Just Push Play." The group debuted the record's first single, "Legendary Child," during the season finale of "American Idol" last month, but the song has failed to gain traction on both the Billboard and iTunes charts.

Tyler also mentioned on-air that Sony will release two more singles before the album drops in November. One of those tracks could be the blues-tinged rocker "Oh Yeah," which the band debuted last week at the Minneapolis kick-off of their Global Warming tour, which finds them trekking across North America alongside Cheap Trick throughout the summer.

"We accomplished what we set out to do, which was write some stuff so we could represent who we were in the old days," Tyler told WMMS. "After all these years, you can become something other than you started out to be -- and I'm not saying that's a bad thing -- but we kinda love our rock and I love the diversity of this band ... I thought that was one of the secrets that Aerosmith had that other bands didn't -- a little bit of this, a little bit of that."
