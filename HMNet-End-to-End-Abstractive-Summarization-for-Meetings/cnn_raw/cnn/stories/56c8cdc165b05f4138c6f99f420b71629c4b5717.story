(CNN) -- Investigators checked cameras at California-Mexico border crossings Monday in their search for a driver who is believed to have caused a weekend crash that killed five people on a California desert highway.

A Dodge Avenger struck a group of 12 motorcycles Saturday on a highway in El Centro, Imperial County, just east of San Diego, after swerving to avoid a gold Honda Civic that had just passed the bikers.

Four people on the bikes and a passenger in the Dodge Avenger died on the scene, California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Deeann Goudie said.  Six other motorcyclists were seriously injured.

"The gold Honda Civic left the scene without stopping and police want to talk with that driver," Goudie said. "We're looking for a 1995-2000 model year Gold Honda Civic."

Police suspect the Honda driver may have fled across the nearby border into Mexico, prompting them to take a look at the border camera video, according to another California Highway Patrol spokesman, Pablo Torrez.

A drunk driving charge that was initially made against the Dodge Avenger driver was dropped Monday after blood test results came back negative, Torrez said.

The bikers are part of the Saddle Tramps Motorcycle group in Lakeside, California. They were taking a casual ride on their Harley Davidsons to celebrate the group's 10th anniversary.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the California Highway Patrol.
