(CNN) -- Looking for love, or perhaps just for some cafeteria food or spelling lessons, an alligator was found Monday inside a middle school in suburban Tampa, Florida.

Tampa Police were notified around 7 a.m. that the gator had set itself down in a prime spot, "in front of the cafeteria" in Stewart Middle School, the department said in a written statement.

Although school does not let out for another week, no children were inside the school when the reptile was discovered, said Hillsborough County School District spokesman Steve Hegarty.

The school is near the Hillsborough River, so it's not too far-fetched to think an alligator might make its way inside, Hegarty said. Still, he doesn't recall any similar incidents.

"The gator was contained in one of the hallways," police said. Trappers from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission caught the creature. No one was injured.

It's currently alligator mating season. According to the conservation commission's website, alligator "courtship" begins in early April, with mating occurring in May or June.
