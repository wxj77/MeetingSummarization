(CNN) -- FIFA President Sepp Blatter said Monday his organization would ban for life any players and administrators found guilty of match-fixing.

"We can't intervene at this early stage, but when those people are condemned and found guilty we will ban them for life. They will not be allowed back into football," Blatter told reporters in Harare, as he wrapped up a one-day visit to Zimbabwe.

FIFA security chief Chris Eaton arrived in Zimbabwe ahead of Blatter on Sunday. The organization is looking into allegations of match-fixing committed two years ago, which resulted in the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) boss being fired in October 2010.

Player Method Mwanjali was one of five athletes who told a ZIFA inquiry last year that he accepted bribes in return for losing matches against Thailand and Syria in 2009.

ZIFA submitted its findings to FIFA, which is now conducting its own investigation.

"We are working with Interpol and the governments. What FIFA is doing is to clean up the situation," Blatter said.

Besides meeting with the country's football administrators, the FIFA president met with President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai during his one-day visit.

He is scheduled to head next to South Africa to attend an International Olympic Committee meeting on Tuesday.
