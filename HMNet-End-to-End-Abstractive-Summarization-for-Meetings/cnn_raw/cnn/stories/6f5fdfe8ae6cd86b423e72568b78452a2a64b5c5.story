New York (CNN) -- Hugh Jackman got a bit more of a workout this weekend than he bargained for.

A woman allegedly screamed "I love you" as she chased the actor with an electric razor while he was at a New York City gym Saturday, police and Jackman's publicist say.

"He was more alarmed than scared," publicist Alan Nierob told CNN Sunday. Jackman thought the woman was grabbing for a weapon, he said.

Manhattan resident Katherine Thurston, 47, was charged with stalking Jackman, according to New York Police spokesman Sgt. Tom Antonetti.

Thurston could not be reached immediately for comment, and it was not immediately clear whether she is being represented by an attorney.

Jackman has seen the woman before outside of his home and his daughter's school, Nierob said.

Police interviewed Jackman and a witness at Gotham Gym. They told police the woman took out the razor inside the gym and followed Jackman "for an extended period of time."

Mike Castle, a trainer at Gotham Gym, saw Thurston enter the facility. She was crying as she slipped past the check-in desk, he said, and headed straight toward Jackman. "The razor fell out of her hands when I stepped in between them," Castle said.

Jackman asked Thurston not to touch him, Antonetti said. She left after security arrived but was later apprehended on the street.

Hugh Jackman's sweet business deal

Jackman had the situation under control, Castle said. "(He's) a super nice guy."

The actor was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Jean Valjean in the 2012 film "Les Mis√©rables." He won a Golden Globe for best performance by an actor in a musical or comedy motion picture for that same role.

The "X-Men" star will appear next in "The Wolverine," which is expected to release this summer.
