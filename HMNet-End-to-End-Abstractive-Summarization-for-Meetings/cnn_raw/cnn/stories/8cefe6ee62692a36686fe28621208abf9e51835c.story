(CNN) -- English Premier League champions Manchester United have signed young Mexico striker Javier Hernandez from Chivas de Guadalajara.

The 21-year-old, who is better known in his homeland as "Chicharito," will join the club for an undisclosed fee on July 1, subject to being granted a UK work permit.

Hernandez agreed personal terms with the Red Devils this week and passed a medical at the club.

As part of the deal Manchester United will travel to Mexico and play a match to open the new 45,000 capacity Chivas Stadium in Guadalajara as part of their preparations for the 2010/11 season.

Hernandez has scored four goals in just four appearances for the Mexico national team and could make their squad for the World Cup finals in South Africa that begin in June.

United manager Alex Ferguson told the club's official Web site: "I am delighted to reach agreement with Chivas to bring such an exciting young striker, who has been in such prolific form for both his club and his country.

"He will be a great addition to our squad and we look forward to welcoming our first Mexican player in the summer.

"We are equally excited to play our first game in Mexico, opening the magnificent new Chivas Stadium in July."
