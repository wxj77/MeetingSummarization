(CNN)The thing about the old card game of War is that anything can happen.

In Chris Hemsworth's case, he got drenched with water.

The "Blackhat" actor, appearing on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," took on the host in War, in which the competitors turn over playing cards, with the higher card designated the winner. In the Hemsworth-Fallon battle, there was an extra twist: After each card was turned, the winner got to throw a glass of water at the loser.

At the conclusion, the person with the most wins got to soak the other with a water cannon.

Hemsworth held his own in the early going, but things didn't turn out well for the Australian actor. Perhaps things go better in "Blackhat," which opens Friday.
