(CNN) -- France have secured their place in the Davis Cup final after taking an unassailable 3-0 lead in their semi-final against Argentina in Lyon on Saturday.

The win came courtesy of Michael Llodra and Arnaud Clement who defeated U.S. Open semi-finalists Horacio Zeballos and Eduardo Schwank 6-4 7-5 6-3 in two hours and 28 minutes.

France were 2-0 ahead overnight thanks to singles wins by Llodra who defeated Juan Monaco, and by Gael Monfils overcame David Nalbandian in four sets.

The nine-time winners haven't been in a Davis Cup final since 2002.

"I am very excited and I am very, very happy because the crowd was unbelievable," France's team captain Guy Forget said, DavisCup.com reported.

"The emotions are here, the spirit is here, the quality of the players is unbelievable. I am so proud to lead a team like this one. They have gone through a lot of things together... They struggled a bit last year but to see them on the court celebrating emotionally is very strong," Forget added, DavisCup.com reported.

But Argentina's captain Tito Vasquez was stunned by the defeat.

"I never thought the result would be so bad. We always thought we could win it," Vasquez said, AFP reported.

France will face either last year's runners-up Czech Republic or Serbia -- who have yet to reach a Davis Cup final -- in December's final.

The Czechs are 2-1 ahead after Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek defeated U.S. Open runner-up Novak Djokovic and partner Nenad Zimonjic 3-6 6-1 6-4 6-1.

But there is all to play for on Sunday.

Djokovic is favorite to beat Berdych in the first reverse singles. Should that match go to form then the tie will be decided by the match between Stepanek and Janko Tipsarevic -- who on paper are separated by just two ranking places.
