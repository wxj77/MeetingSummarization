(CNN)A powerful 7.4-magnitude quake shook the Pacific coast of Central America on Tuesday, causing some damage and killing at least one person in El Salvador.

The quake was deep (70.5 kilometers or 43 miles) but close to El Salvador's shoreline -- about 64 kilometers from the municipality of Intipuca.

El Salvador's Ministry of Weather and Natural Resources initially issued a tsunami warning for the coastal regions, saying the quake was felt throughout the country. It later downgraded it to a tsunami alert.

Power to the city was knocked out, but has been largely restored.

At least one death was reported in San Miguel. A woman was killed when an electrical utility pole fell on her, Mayor Will Salgado said.
