(CNN) -- One of the strangest sequel projects in movie history is no longer a sequel.

In a joint statement, MGM Studios and Dahlia Waingort, the producer of the film originally known as Raging Bull II, declared on Wednesday that Waingort's film now has the working title The Bronx Bull, and is in no way associated with Martin Scorsese's 1980 film Raging Bull.

The announcement resolves a lawsuit brought by MGM in July that attempted to shut down production on the film, which traces the life of boxer Jake LaMotta in the years that span before and after Raging Bull. LaMotta, now 91 years old, has been cooperating with that project, but it otherwise had nothing to do with Scorsese's film, which won star Robert De Niro an Academy Award. Instead, Boardwalk Empire's William Forsythe is playing the older LaMotta, with Mojean Aria playing him as a youth.

Check out the full statement below:

The parties have amicably reached a resolution of their pending litigation, pursuant to which production of a film based upon certain events in the life of Jake LaMotta will proceed under the working title The Bronx Bull. That film is not related in any way to the 1980 motion picture entitled Raging Bull, and MGM is not associated with the film in any respect. Neither party will have any further statements regarding this matter.

â€” Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc and Dahlia Waingort, Producer, Sunset Pictures
