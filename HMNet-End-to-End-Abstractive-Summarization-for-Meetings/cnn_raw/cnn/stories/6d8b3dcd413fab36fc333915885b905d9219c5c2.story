(CNN) -- Keegan Bradley rounded off a triumphant rookie season by claiming the PGA Tour's Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda Wednesday.

Bradley held off a charging Charl Schwartzel of South Africa to win the prestigious end-of-season title by a shot after carding a level-par 71 on the Port Royal Golf Course.

It left the American on four-under 138 for the two-round tournament which brings together the season's four major winners.

Masters champion Schwartzel produced a best of the day six-under 65 but was ultimately undone by his first round three-over par 74.

U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy started the day in the joint lead with Bradley after their first round 67s, but fell away in blustery conditions to card a four-over 75 to finish in third place on level-par 142.

McIlroy's Northern Ireland compatriot Darren Clarke was way off the pace as the British Open winner closed out a second round of 74 for nine-over 151.

The 25-year-old Bradley, who turned professional in 2008, has enjoyed a remarkable first season on the PGA Tour, claiming the Byron Nelson Classic before his triumph in the PGA Championship where he beat Jason Dufner in a playoff.

Remarkably, it was his first appearance in a major, only one of three golfers to achieve the feat.

He kept his nerve as Schwartzel drew level through the turn after picking up five straight birdies.

Bradley, who had bogeyed the opening hole, birdied the 10th to open up a one-shot lead over Schwartzel which he kept to the finish to claim the $600,000 first prize.

"It was a lot more intense than I thought it was going to be," Bradley told gathered reporters after his victory.

"Coming down the stretch, it felt like any other tournament that I played in. It was very, very intense, and I was nervous over that 5-footer to win."
