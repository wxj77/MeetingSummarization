(CNN)  -- Four police officers and a suspect were shot in a raid for firearms and narcotics early Thursday in central New Jersey, a local prosecutor's office said.

The officers from the Lakewood Police Department's tactical unit were shot upon entering the property and returned fire, hitting suspect Jamie Gonzalez, said Ocean County Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michael Mohel.

Gonzalez, 39, received multiple gunshot wounds and is in critical but stable condition, Mohel said.

One officer was shot in the face and is being treated at an undisclosed hospital, the deputy chief prosecutor said. He's in serious but stable condition.

Another officer was shot in the foot and is in stable condition. The other two officers sustained injuries after receiving gunshots to their bulletproof vests, Mohel said. Their names were not disclosed.

The warrant for firearms and narcotics was served at 2:25 a.m. ET in conjunction with federal, state and local authorities.

Lakewood is about 70 miles south of New York City.

In July, another shootout in New Jersey left one police officer dead. Jersey City police officer Marc DiNardo died after being shot in the face in a raid. He was one of five officers injured in the shootout, and the two suspects involved were killed.
