(CNN) -- Fiji has beaten defending champions South Africa 33-26 in the final of the Japan Rugby Sevens at the Prince Chichibu Memorial Ground in Tokyo.

Led by captain Osea Kolinisau, Fiji ran in five tries to overpower the Springboks and claim their second Cup win of this year's IRB Sevens World Series following a triumph in Dubai at the end of November.

The win keeps Fiji third in the overall standings with their points rising to 95 while New Zealand are in second place on 114 points, two behind new leaders South Africa.

"It's our goal this season to win the series and we are closing up the points," Kolinisau said, irbsevens.com reported.

"We hope to try and improve on our mistakes and take one game at a time in Hong Kong."

Kolinisau said the win in Japan will heighten expectations that his team can successfully defend their Hong Kong title -- a tournament they have won 14 times overall.

In the remaining matches, England took third place with a 21-12 victory over the Kiwis while Australia won the Plate final beating the U.S. 17-12.

Wales was victorious in the Bowl final beating old adversaries Scotland 28 points to 21.

Round seven of the nine-leg World Series gets underway at the Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
