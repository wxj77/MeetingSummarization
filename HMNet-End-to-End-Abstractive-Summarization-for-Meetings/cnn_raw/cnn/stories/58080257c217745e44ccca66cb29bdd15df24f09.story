This marks the second time that a Sharknado film has been propelled, like a deadly ocean predator in the midst of a freak weather event, into theaters. Tickets sold out for midnight showings of the first installment of the made-for-TV franchise in select Regal cinemas last year, prompting theaters to offer another set of screenings.
