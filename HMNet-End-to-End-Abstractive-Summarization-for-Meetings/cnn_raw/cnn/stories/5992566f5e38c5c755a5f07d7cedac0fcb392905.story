(CNN) -- Solheim Cup veteran Carin Koch has been given the responsibility of extending Europe's dominance in the prestigious women's golf competition.

The 43-year-old Swede was vice-captain last year when Europe beat the U.S. on American soil for the first time.

She will lead Europe's women for the 2015 match at St. Leon-Rot in Germany, seeking to clinch an unprecedented third successive victory for the team. It would match the best winning run by the Americans, who managed it from 1994-98 and 2005-09.

The Ladies European Tour made the announcement in Frankfurt on Friday, when Koch also revealed that one of her vice-captains will be fellow Swede Annika Sorenstam, a former world No. 1, 10-time major winner and eight-time Solheim Cup representative.

Koch played in four straight Solheim Cups between 2000 and 2005, winning 11.5 points out of 16.

"I am extremely delighted and honored to captain the 2015 Solheim Cup team," Koch told reporters.

"Being vice-captain to Lotta (Neumann) in 2013, I once again experienced the thrill of the Solheim Cup matches which are unlike any other tournament in professional golf.

"I cannot wait to stand with the team on the first tee next September to start our quest for the hat-trick of wins against the U.S. team.

"I look forward to working with the German team at Golf Club St. Leon-Rot for the next year and a half to put on the best Solheim Cup ever."

Ladies European Tour chief executive officer Ivan Khodabakhsh congratulated Koch on her appointment.

"We are delighted that Carin has accepted the invitation to lead the European Solheim Cup team as she is a fantastic representative of European golf and her passion and experience of the event will transfer to her being an excellent and inspiring captain," he said.

The Solheim Cup, a three-day equivalent of the men's Ryder Cup, was first staged in 1990.

Next year's event takes place between September 18-20.
