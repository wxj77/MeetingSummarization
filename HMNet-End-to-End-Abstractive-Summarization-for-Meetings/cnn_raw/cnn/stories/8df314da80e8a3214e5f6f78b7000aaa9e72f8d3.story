In focus -- Reviving the pearl industry

Harvesting pearls was a major source of income for Bahrain and the region until the early 20th century when Japanese cultured pearls flooded world markets and oil was discovered.

We explore the kingdom's pearl traditions, from diving for oysters to one of the oldest pearl retailing families in Bahrain.
