(CNN) -- You voted for prolific 19th century musician Ludwig van Beethoven as the most iconic composer of the western world.

Last month, CNN's arts and culture program, icon, asked you to vote for your top five iconic composers.

Your top choice, Beethoven, was the first great composer to earn a successful living without patronage and composed some of his greatest works after becoming profoundly deaf.

In second place came Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Perhaps the most famous composer of all time, Mozart penned his first work aged five and went on to write the opera's "Don Giovanni" and "Cosi fan tutte."

One of Baroque music's greatest champions, Johann Sebastian Bach, took third place, while Romantic composer Tchaikovsky and child prodigy pianist Chopin rounded out the top five.
