(CNN Student News) -- January 14, 2014

It's not every day that the three branches of U.S. government intersect, but we're breaking down why and how in today's edition of CNN Student News. We also report on water pollution in West Virginia, a security warning regarding the Sochi Olympics, and a student who refuses to let Down Syndrome keep him from going to college.
