Chantal packed maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph) on Tuesday night and the winds are expect to near hurricane strength before the storm reaches Hispaniola, the hurricane center said.

A tropical storm warning was in effect for Puerto Rico, the coast of the Dominican Republic, the coast of Haiti, Turks and Caicos and the southeastern Bahamas.  A hurricane watch was posted for part of the Dominican Republic, from Barahona to Samana.

Chantal is expected to dump 3 to 6 inches of rain over Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Some parts could see as much as 8 inches.

In addition, a storm surge could raise water levels as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide in the southern Dominican Republic. Dangerous waves will accompany the surge, forecasters said.
