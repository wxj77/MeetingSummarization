(CNN) -- One of two convicted murderers who allegedly used forged documents to walk out of Franklin Correctional Institution in North Carrabelle, south of Tallahassee, was ordered Wednesday held without bond on an escape charge and sent back to the prison.

Wearing a dark jumpsuit, Charles Walker nodded several times in response to questions during his 65-second appearance in the 9th Judicial Circuit Court of Florida, in Orlando.

No hearing has been announced for the second man, Joseph Jenkins.

After days on the lam, Walker and Jenkins were recaptured Saturday night at Panama City's Coconut Grove Motor Inn, some 360 miles northwest of the Orlando area.

They were booked Tuesday in Orange County, Florida, the place from which both men hail and where the murders they are responsible for took place.

Walker and Jenkins, both 34, had been serving life terms without parole at Franklin for unrelated killings.

Jenkins escaped on September 27, while Walker left October 8. Both men used legal-looking documents bearing bogus signatures, including those of the Orlando-area state attorney and Judge Belvin Perry, plus the seal of the Orange County clerk of court's office, officials said.

State officials have been investigating such scams for about a year and had warned prosecutors about the schemes over the summer, said Jerry Bailey, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's commissioner.

On Tuesday, Bailey's agency announced that a reward of up to $10,000 was being offered for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the forgeries or the escapes. Florida attorney general's office is offering another reward of up to $10,000.
