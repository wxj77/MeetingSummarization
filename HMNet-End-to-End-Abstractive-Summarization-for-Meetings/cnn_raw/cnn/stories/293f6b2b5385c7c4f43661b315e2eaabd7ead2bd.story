(EW.com ) -- When last we saw Olivia Pope, she was flying off into the sunset (or maybe just flying off) with Jake by her sideâ€”leaving behind a broken Fitz, who'd just lost his son and realized some horrible things about his father. D.C. now rests in the hands of Olivia's own father, who once again took over B-613. So what awaits the team when season four starts up? How about a new face?

EW has confirmed that "Arrested Development" star Portia de Rossi will join "Scandal's" fourth season for a multiple-episode arc. Ellen DeGeneres first announced the news on Twitter, bragging about her wife's "top secret" storyline.

Could the words "top secret" mean de Rossi is a part of Papa Pope's B-613 army? We'll find out Thursday, Sept. 25 at 9 p.m., when Scandal returns on ABC.
