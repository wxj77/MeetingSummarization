(CNN)A man crashed through the gates of a Michigan Coast Guard station around 6 a.m. ET on Sunday, assaulted personnel and said he had a bomb in his truck, authorities said.

No Coast Guard officials were injured in the incident in Grand Haven, said Petty Officer Christopher Yaw, a spokesman with the Ninth Coast Guard District. The city is on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, about 36 miles (58 kilometers) west of Grand Rapids.

According to Yaw, a man called saying that he had put a bomb in his truck. Coast Guard officials notified the command center for the Lake Michigan sector while ordering that all people be evacuated from the station, he said.

After driving through the gates and parking his truck, the man "gained access to the station building," Yaw told CNN but provided no further details.

He said the man, who authorities said is 34, was confronted, subdued and turned over to the Grand Haven Department of Public Safety.

Officials are continuing to search the grounds, and an explosives ordnance team is working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Yaw said.

The incident was initially investigated as a possible "domestic act of terrorism," said Erin Von Tom of the Department of Public Safety. But no link to terrorism or a terrorist organization has been found, she said.

Residents of a nearby condo complex were told to stay in their homes but were later allowed to leave.
