"This is the first time we have won the gold in men's doubles, so it's certainly historic," Sharath told the official Commonwealth Games website. "Personally, this has given me more satisfaction than my singles performance at Delhi 2010."

"We decided to adopt an aggressive strategy and Sharath came back really strong after his semifinal defeat in singles. We could not have expected anything better than this," Saha added.

In the pool, English diver Tom Daley won his second gold medal in two days, adding the 10 meter platform title to the synchronized diving crown he had already claimed in Delhi.
