(CNN) -- A golf cart driver at the U.S. Open was arrested and charged after authorities say he slammed into a state trooper.

Thomas Lineberry, 59, was charged with felony assault on a law enforcement officer, felony hit and run, driving while impaired and resist, obstruct and delay, according to a statement from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety.

He is accused of hitting Trooper Ryan A. Goodin, who was treated for a minor leg injury.

A magistrate gave Lineberry a $3,000 secured bond, the statement said. He posted bond Saturday night.

Attempts to contact Lineberry on Sunday were unsuccessful. It was not immediately clear whether he had retained an attorney.

"We are aware of the incident and will refrain from commenting further until we have all of the facts and the volunteer involved has an opportunity to share his case in court. He is no longer assisting the production," an NBC Sports spokesman said.
