(CNN) -- Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini has said the English FA Cup winners could move for Atletico Madrid's Sergio Aguero.

But Mancini suggested any move for the Argentina forward could depend on whether or not his compatriot Carlos Tevez completes a switch to Brazilian outfit Corinthians.

The Italian coach said on Monday that City had agreed a fee with Corinthians for Tevez, 27, claims which were later denied by the Sao Paulo club.

Any deal to take Tevez back to the team he played for between 2004-06 would need to be completed before the Brazilian transfer window closes on July 20.

When asked about the latest on Tevez's proposed transfer, Mancini told a press conference: "I don't know ... but they are continuing to talk about the deal."

Former Inter Milan boss Mancini moved on to discuss a potential bid for Aguero, who scored 20 league goals for Atletico last season, and he said an offer from the Etihad Stadium side could be imminent.

"At the moment I don't know," said Mancini when asked if a bid had already been made for the former Independiente striker.

"Maybe in the next days. At the moment I haven't spoken to Gary Cook [City's CEO] or the chairman, I don't know what has happened."

And when asked if any move for Aguero was dependent on Tevez leaving the club, the 46-year-old replied: "Yes, I think so."

Both Tevez and Aguero were part of Sergio Batista's Argentina squad which was eliminated from the 2011 Copa America on Saturday, beaten on penalties by Uruguay at the quarterfinal stage.

One player who will definitely not be at City next season is Shay Given, after the 35-year-old goalkeeper completed a move to Aston Villa.

Given, who formerly spent 11 years with Newcastle United and is the Republic of Ireland's most-capped player, has signed a five-year deal with the Birmingham-based team.
