(CNN) -- A man who told Maryland State Police that his wife was killed by a carjacker early Friday morning has been charged in her death.

Ryan Holness, 28, was charged with first- and second-degree murder in the death of Serika Dunkley Holness, 26, according to Maryland police.

Her body was found about 6 a.m. Friday in a field in Crumpton, Maryland, police said.

Holness was arrested after inconsistencies surfaced in his story, according to investigators.

Holness said that he and his wife were carjacked by a man armed with a knife and a gun on the New Jersey Turnpike while returning to Maryland from New York on Thursday night, police said.

"He told investigators that he was assaulted by the suspect and forced to drive to Crumpton," said Gregory Shipley of the Maryland State Police. "He said the suspect bound his feet and hands with duct tape before attacking his wife who had tried to flee the scene."

Police interviewed various people and launched a nationwide search for the carjacker and Holness' 2007 blue Honda Accord, Shipley said.

"Information provided by Holness throughout the day Friday did not match information developed through witnesses and evidence at the scene," Shipley said.

Shortly after 11 p.m. Friday, Holness' car was located by a D.C. police officer on a Washington street.

"Maryland State police homicide detectives have taken custody of the car," Shipley said.

State police are not yet sure how the car got to Washington.
