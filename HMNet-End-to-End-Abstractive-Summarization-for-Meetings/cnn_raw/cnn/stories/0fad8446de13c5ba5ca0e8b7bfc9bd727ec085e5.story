(CNN) -- It's an early Christmas for Madonna fans.

The singer didn't plan on releasing her new album "Rebel Heart" anytime soon, but that all changed after unfinished versions of her newest songs found their way on the Internet.

Early mixes from the Queen of Pop's 13th album had been leaked, and longtime manager Guy Oseary asked the public to help find those responsible.

Madonna fired back by officially releasing six new tracks Saturday morning, which are now up for sale on iTunes.

In a tweet, the singer wrote, "Happy early X-Mas!" and linked to where people go could to purchase her new songs.

The tracks available immediately for download include "Living for Love," an upbeat anthem, "Devil Pray," a haunting composition, "Ghosttown," an emotional mantra, "Illuminati," an electronic orchestra of melodies, as well as two other songs.

Madonna took to Instagram this past week, thanking fans for not listening to the tracks floating around online. "Thank you for not listening! Thank you for your loyalty! Thank you for waiting and if you have heard please know they are unfinished demos stolen long ago and not ready to be presented to the world," she wrote in her post.

Earlier this month, the singer posted a photo of her smashed iPod on Instagram after discovering the leak of her track "Rebel Heart." In her post she wrote, "This broken ipod is a symbol of my broken heart! That my music has been stolen and leaked! I have been violated as a human and an artist!"

Leaks have tormented Madonna in the past. In 2003, the singer's website was defaced and every song off her "American Life" album was leaked online.

Rolling Stone reported that Madonna had wanted her newest single, "Living for Love," to be released on Valentine's Day, with the rest of the album coming out in spring.
