(CNN) -- On this week's Tech Check podcast, Doug Gross, John Sutter and Stephanie Goldberg take a look at the digital rush of mass consumption that is "Cyber Monday."

This year, the Monday after Thanksgiving became the biggest shopping day in the history of the internet, with an estimated $1.25 billion spent online.

So, why is John so bitter about that? Listen to find out.

We also take a look at this week's announcement that Spotify, the hot-as-fire music-streaming site, is opening up its massive database of songs to outside app developers. We look at some of our favorites so far and discuss the potential this move creates.

Our Reader Comments of the Week come from a story about Facebook and the possibility that the networking super-site will eventually offer itself as a publicly traded company on Wall Street.

The story looks at how such a move might impact Facebook's users. But we use this opportunity for a reality check on some comments that crop up every time we write a Facebook story.

And in the Tech Fail of the Week, we look at a controversy that popped up when civil liberties groups found out that Siri, the iPhone 4S's voice-activated digital assistant, won't tell you where the nearest abortion clinic is located.

Did Apple fail by leaving out a potentially controversial piece of information? Or did the Web fail for getting its feathers ruffled over an oversight on a new piece of software. We discuss ... you decide.
