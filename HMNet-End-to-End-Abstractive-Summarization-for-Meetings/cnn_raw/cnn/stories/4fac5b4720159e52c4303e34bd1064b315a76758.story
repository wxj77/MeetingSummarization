(CNN) -- There's always another strange crustacean out there somewhere.

There are blue lobsters and yellow lobsters. Something on YouTube called a Japanese mitten lobster. Giant cannibal shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico and supergiant albino shrimplike creatures off New Zealand.

Then there's Lola. The six-clawed lobster showed up at the Maine State Aquarium in West Boothbay Harbor last week, a gift from Capt. Peter Brown and lobsterman Richard Figueiredo of the fishing vessel Rachael Leah, which hauled in the hexa-clawed creature off the coast of Massachusetts.

Weighing in at four pounds, Lola has a normal claw on her right side, but on the left has five smaller claws, arranged sort of like the five fingers of a human hand.

"This claw deformity is a genetic mutation," Aimee Hayden-Roderiques, manager of the aquarium, told CNN affiliate WMTW-TV. "Sometimes they have this throughout their life, sometimes this happens during a regeneration from a damaged or lost claw."

Hayden-Roderiques said Lola will soon be on display with some of those other strange lobsters, the blue ones, the yellow ones and even half-and-half colored ones.

"We're kind of the place for unusual lobsters," she told the Bangor Daily News. "Everyone who comes in wants to see the weird lobsters."

You've gotta hand it to them, er, ah, Lola. They've got that market covered.
