(CNN) -- Veronica Mars is returning -- sort of.

Buzzfeed reports that "Veronica Mars" cast members including Kristen Bell and Jason Dohring will appear in "Play It Again, Dick," a Web series about the "Veronica Mars character," Dick Casablancas.

"Veronica Mars" and "Play It Again Dick" creator Rob Thomas told HitFix: "The Web series will have more in common with 'Party Down' tonally, but it will be about Ryan Hansen, or at least a version of Ryan Hansen, deciding to capitalize on the current 'Veronica Mars' heat to get his own series on the air. He'll try to pull his actor pals into the venture with varying degrees of success."

The cast will play their characters as well as versions of themselves.

In March, a "Veronica Mars" film premiered in theaters after fans successfully funded a Kickstarter campaign to make it happen.
