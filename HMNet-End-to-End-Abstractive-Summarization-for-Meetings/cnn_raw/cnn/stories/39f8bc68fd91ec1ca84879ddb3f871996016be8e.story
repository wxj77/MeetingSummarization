(CNN) -- Police are investigating after two UNICEF staff members went missing in Karachi, Pakistan, a United Nations spokesman said Sunday.

The staffers went missing on Thursday evening, United Nations spokesman Vittorio Cammarota said.

Police are in close contact with the UNICEF employees' families, he said.

The port city of Karachi is Pakistan's financial capital.

On Saturday, gunmen wounded a prominent Pakistani TV news anchor there. His brother linked the attack to the nation's government, drawing a denial from military officials.

Hamid Mir was shot three times by gunmen in a car and on two motorcycles near Karachi's airport, his network Geo News -- a CNN affiliate -- reported.

Amir Mir -- the targeted news anchor's brother and a journalist himself -- said his brother believed ISI, Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency, had plans to assassinate him.

The Pakistani military public relations agency ISPR said that "raising allegations against ISI or the head of ISI without any basis is highly regrettable and misleading."

In the same statement, a spokesman for that agency condemned the attack and "prayed for (Mir's) well-being and quick recovery."

CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.
