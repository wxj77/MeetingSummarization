(CNN) -- Yohan Blake stunned Usain Bolt over 100m in the Jamaica Olympic trials to signal his intent ahead of the London Games where they will battle again for gold medal glory.

The 2011 world champion was never headed as he set the best time of the year of 9.75 seconds at the National Stadium in Kingston Friday night.

Bolt made an appalling start and had to charge through the field to claim second place, 0.11 seconds behind, with Asafa Powell in third place.

Only the top three in the Jamaica trials are selected for the individual events at the Olympics, so there was not room for error by any of the star sprinters.

Bolt was disqualified for a false start in the 100m in the world championships in Daegu last year, leaving the way clear for the 22-year-old Blake.

It may have been playing on his mind as he got left off the blocks and could not make up the deficit on Blake, who shares the same coach in Glen Mills.

Why do all the top sprinters come from Jamaica?

"He's a class runner without a doubt and I have said it over the years that he is one of the best. So for me it's just one of those things," Bolt told AFP.

The pair were back in action Saturday, winning their qualifying heats in the 200m ahead of Sunday's final over the longer sprint.

In the women's 100m there was more stunning action as defending Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce clocked a world leading 10.70 seconds to edge out Veronica Campbell-Brown (10.82) and Kerron Stewart (10.94).

"This is the first hurdle and I crossed it and I am just looking forward to the Olympics," Fraser-Pryce said.

Jamaican sprinters are expected to dominate their events and the relays at the London Olympics which start in a month's time.

Bolt won three gold medals in Beijing in 2008, claiming the 100-200 double and anchoring Jamaica to victory in the 4x100m sprint relay.
