(CNN) -- Apparently, reality star Snooki is not just too pretty for jail, she is too pretty for court.

Nicole Polizzi, also known as Snooki on MTV's reality show "Jersey Shore," did not attend a court hearing in New Jersey on Wednesday.

Her lawyer, Ray Raya, appeared on her behalf, to enter a "not guilty" plea on a disorderly conduct charge, according to a Seaside Heights Municipal Court spokesman.

The 22-year-old was arrested in late July on the beaches of Seaside Heights, New Jersey. She will not serve jail time, but faces potential fines ranging from $250 to $1,000.

She is expected to attend her next hearing, set for September 8, the court spokesman said.

Polizzi told MTV News that jail is not the place for someone as attractive as she is.

"I'm too pretty to be in jail. I'm a good person. I'm not a criminal and I will never go back there," the "Jersey Shore" star said.

She said she realizes she may have had too many drinks, but that it's nothing to get crazy over.

"I don't know why people take it so seriously," Polizzi said. "I had a couple cocktails, and they just put me in a drunk tank to sober me up."

The arrest of the TV star even caught the attention of Arizona Sen. John McCain.

McCain jokingly brought up the arrest during a recent visit to Phoenix radio station KMLE Country 108.

"I have a question for you that I thought about on the way over: Should Snooki go to jail? Or -- a question for our listeners -- is Snooki too good-looking to go to jail?" McCain asked.

"This has given a whole new meaning to our justice system, and I'm kind of leaning towards Snooki being too good-looking."
