(CNN) -- The French spend more time eating and drinking than anyone else among the world's wealthy nations, a new study reveals.

The study, by the Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), found that the average French person spends nine hours sleeping every night, and spends two hours a day eating.

On the other end of the spectrum, the average Japanese gets seven hours of sleep and also spends longer at work -- and getting to work -- than on leisure activities.

And when it comes to food, Mexicans spend the least time: just over an hour a day.

The survey looked at 18 countries among the organization's 30 members to see how people use "that most fundamental of resources:" time. The results were released Monday.

Among the organization's findings:

The lowest obesity rates? South Korea and Japan with less than 4 percent of the population exceeding a BMI of more than 30.
