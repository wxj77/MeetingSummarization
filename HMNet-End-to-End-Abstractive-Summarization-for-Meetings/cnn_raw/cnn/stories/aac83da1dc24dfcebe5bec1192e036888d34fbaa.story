Adam Ritchie, a Domino's Pizza manager in Cheyenne, Wyoming, said he'd never received a call like the one he got Monday night.

"I need to feed my whole plane," the caller told him.

"Lucky me, I hear 160 people. It ended up being like 38 pizzas," Ritchie told CNN.

A Frontier Airlines flight from Washington to Denver was diverted to Cheyenne because of bad weather. The plane was stuck on the ground for nearly two hours.

The food on board was gone, so the pilot decided to order pizzas for everyone, a passenger told CNN affiliate KDVR. Each row got its own pie.

"Next thing you know, Domino's Pizza was rolling up to the plane," passenger Logan Torres told CNN. She sent CNN photos of flight attendants passing out boxes.

Frontier Airlines spokeswoman Tyri Squyres said she wasn't surprised at all by what the pilot did.

"This is not unusual for our pilots to go above and beyond to care for our customers," she said. "We have some great pilots who work here."
