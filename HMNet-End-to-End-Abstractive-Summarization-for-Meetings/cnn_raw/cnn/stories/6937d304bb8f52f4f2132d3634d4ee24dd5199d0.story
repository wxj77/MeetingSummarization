Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Army said Sunday it has identified the remains of the last missing U.S. service member unaccounted for in Iraq.

Staff Sgt. Ahmed K. Altaie of Ann Arbor, Michigan, was kidnapped October 23, 2006, after he left the Green Zone in Baghdad. The military said Altaie, then 41, and serving as a translator for the U.S. military, was visiting family members when he was abducted.

A group in February 2007 claimed on a militant Shiite Web site that it had Altaie and posted a 10-second video of a man it claimed was him. The man in the video was Altaie, his uncle told CNN then.

Altaie's remains were identified on Saturday by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner at the Dover Port Mortuary in Delaware, the Army said.
