(CNN) -- Bayern Munich extended their dream start to the Bundesliga campaign with a 3-0 thumping of Felix Magath's Wolfsburg Tuesday to make it five wins from five.

Mario Mandzukic scored twice after Bastian Schweinsteiger's opener to secure an easy win for the Bavarian giants in the Allianz Arena.

They have gone two points clear at the top after Eintracht Frankfurt were held 3-3 at home by two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund.

Schweinsteiger struck the post with a pair of efforts before giving Bayern a 24th minute lead.

Mandzukic doubled the lead with a header in the 57th minute and rounded off the scoring eight minutes later with the fifth of the league season for the Croatian star.

Dortmund were two up after goals from Lukasz Piszczek and Marco Reus inside the half hour mark on their travels.

But second-placed Frankfurt pulled level with two goals inside two second half minutes from Stefan Aigner and Takashi Inui.

Dortmund substitute Mario Goetze looked to have won it when he stabbed home for their third but Anderson salvaged a point for the home side after 73 minutes.

In other matches, Schalke beat Mainz 3-0 with Jefferson Farfan opening the scoring from the spot and new boys Fortuna Dusseldorf continued their unbeaten start with a 2-0 win at Greuther Fuerth.

In Italy, Serie A leaders Juventus dropped their first points of the season in a goalless draw at Fiorentina.
