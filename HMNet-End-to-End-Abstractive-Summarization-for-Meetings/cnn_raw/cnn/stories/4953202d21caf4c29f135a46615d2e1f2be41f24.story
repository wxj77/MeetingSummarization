(CNN)An AIG insurance company executive who'd been missing for a week is dead, his family said on a Facebook page Thursday evening.

Omar Meza went missing after a company dinner last Thursday at the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort & Spa in Palm Desert, California.

The 33-year-old was last seen around 11 p.m. on January 8. He did not show up to meetings the next day and was reported missing.

"I spoke to him. ... I was the last conversation per his telephone records ... on Thursday night around 11:20 p.m.," said his wife, Diane.

"It was late on a work night. I told him, 'Head to your hotel and call me when you get there.' I never got that call," she said. "I tried calling him, but he didn't answer. I just went to bed. Didn't think too much of it."

She said her husband suffered short-term memory loss from a traffic accident last year. It's uncertain whether that had any effect on his disappearance.

Meza's jacket and wallet were found on the resort's golf course, CNN affiliates KESQ and KMIR reported.

A man's body was found in the 74800 block of Country Club Drive, a tweet from the Riverside County Sheriff's Office said.

Investigators have not confirmed the identity of the body. However, it was found in a body of water and appears to be male, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said in a news release. The body was taken to the Coroner's Office, which will determine the cause of death.

On the Facebook page dedicated to "Find Omar Meza," the family asked for privacy, saying, "we are with heavy hearts tonight as we announce the passing of Omar Meza. He was a very loved son, husband, brother & friend." The family also thanked those who supported them, writing, "it brings tears to our eyes to see how well loved Omar was, he will be missed by many."
