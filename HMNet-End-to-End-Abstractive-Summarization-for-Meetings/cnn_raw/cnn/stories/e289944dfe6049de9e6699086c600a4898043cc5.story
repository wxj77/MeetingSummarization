(CNN) -- When Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines on November 8, 2013, it struck the city of Tacloban hard.

The capital city of Leyte province, nearly 400 miles south-east of Manila, was one of the first places hit by the storm and was devastated by a huge "storm surge" fueled by winds that reached an average of 195 mph (310 kmph).

Around 200,000 people were made homeless in a matter of hours as a wall of ocean water flattened their homes.

Tacloban City Stadium was one of just a handful of structures in the area to withstand the storm, despite its coastal location.

CNN camera operator Scott Clotworthy visited it and other locations in Tacloban used by the AFP agency seven months ago and shot these updated photos.
