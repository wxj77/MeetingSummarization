(CNN) -- The maker of Benadryl and Tylenol has added five lots of the popular over-the-counter drugs to its growing list of recalled products, McNeil Consumer Healthcare announced Wednesday in a written statement.

Saying the drugs were "inadvertently omitted from the initial recall action" of January 15, McNeil disclosed it was voluntarily recalling four lots of Benadryl Allergy Ultratab Tablets (100 count) and one lot of Extra Strength Tylenol Rapid Release Gels (50 count).

The Johnson and Johnson subsidiary said customers should call 1-888-222-6036 or use the website www.mcneilproductrecall.com for information on how to receive a refund or replacement product. The drugs were sold in the United States and in Bermuda, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago.

McNeil said the "risk of adverse medical events is remote."  Adverse event reports are consumer complaints of a serious side effect associated with the use of a medical product, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Adverse events could include death, hospitalization, disability and other health complications.

The products were recalled because of an unusual odor associated with the chemical 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA) that was applied to shipping pallets, the company said.

McNeil's other recalls in the past eight months were:

-- In November, five lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain 100 count with the EZ-open cap were recalled for unusual odor leading to nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea.

-- In December, the recall was expanded to include all product lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain caplet 100 count bottles with the red EZ-open cap.

-- In January, the recall was widened to an undisclosed number of Tylenol, Motrin and other over-the-counter drugs after complaints of consumers feeling sick from an odor.

--In May, 50 children's versions of these nonprescription medicines were also recalled because of quality and safety concerns. Following the pediatric medicine recall, Johnson and Johnson suspended production at McNeil's facility in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, that manufactured the children's drugs.

The lot number can be found on the bottle label. The lot numbers for the products recalled Wednesday were ASA202, AJA008, ADA194, ABA022 and ABA264. It was unclear how many bottles were recalled Wednesday.

The recalls have affected the availability of the drugs, CNNMoney reports. McNeil spokeswoman Bonnie Jacobs told CNNMoney that "the pace of restocking is accelerating" following the January recall. The drug maker expects to be "at close to normal levels of production toward the end of the second quarter," Jacobs said.
