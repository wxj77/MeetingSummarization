(EW.com ) -- As Tracy Jordan once said on "30 Rock:" Live every week like it's Shark Week.

Syfy seems to be taking that maxim to heart, announcing its own Shark Week of sorts (Sorry, Discovery), pegged to the upcoming release of "Sharknado 2: The Second One." "Sharknado 2," is, of course, a sequel to last year's super-buzzy, low-budget television movie, "Sharknado."

"Sharknado Week" will air July 26 through August 2; Sharknado 2 premieres Wed. July 30. Also in the programming block? Roger Corman's "Sharktopus vs. Pteracuda" (August 2), Mega Shark vs. Mecha Shark (July 26), and "Sharkmania: The Top 15 Biggest Baddest Bloodiest Bites" (July 27).

No one could forget the plot of "Sharknado 2," but here's Syfy's description once again: "A freak weather system turns its deadly fury on New York City, unleashing a Sharknado on the population and its most cherished iconic sites -- and only Fin (Ian Ziering) and April (Tara Reid) can save the Big Apple. The movie, directed by Anthony C. Ferrante from a screenplay by Thunder Levin, also stars Mark McGrath, Kari Wuhrer, Vivica A. Fox and Judah Friedlander, with cameo appearances including Kelly Osbourne, Judd Hirsch, Perez Hilton, Matt Lauer, Al Roker, Andy Dick, Robert Klein, Sandra "Pepa" Denton, Biz Markie, Downtown Julie Brown, Richard Kind and Kurt Angle, among others."

The week might become an annual thing â€” Syfy has already ordered a third Sharknado.
