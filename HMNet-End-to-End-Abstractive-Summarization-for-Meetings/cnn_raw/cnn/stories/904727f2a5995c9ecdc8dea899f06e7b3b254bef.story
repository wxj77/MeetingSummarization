(CNN) -- Barcelona warmed up for their crucial last-16 Champions League second-leg tie against AC Milan on Tuesday with a 2-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna in La Liga on Saturday.

The Catalans made seven changes from the team which lost 2-1 to Real Madrid last weekend as they look ahead to more important tasks next week -- overturning the Italian giant's 2-goal advantage from the first leg at the San Siro.

Alexis Sanchez put Barcelona in front seven minutes before the break rising to head home Daniel Alves' cross from the right.

The second half was tight with Barcelona dominating possession but unable to unlock Deportivo's defense.

The decisive second goal came deep into the half when Lionel Messi (who came on as a second-half substitute) bagged his 17th consecutive league goal in the 88th minute, deftly putting the ball over goalkeeper Aranzubia.

It wrapped up three points for the league leaders and stretches their lead to 14 points ahead of second-place Atletico Madrid's match against Real Sociedad on Sunday evening.

Third-place Real Madrid travel to Celta de Vigo in Sunday's other evening fixture.

In the other La Liga games played Saturday, Valledolid held fourth-placed Malaga to a 1-1 draw, while Real Vallecano move up to eighth after a 2-0 win against Espanyol.

In France's Ligue 1, Paris St Germain came from a goal down to beat Nancy 2-1 at Parc des Princes on Saturday.

Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a brace to take his tally of league goals to 24 this season and give the league leaders a five-point lead ahead of second-placed Lyon's match against Marseille on Sunday.

Meanwhile in Serie A's only Saturday fixture, Udinese and Roma drew 1-1.
