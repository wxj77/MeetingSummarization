Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed to the hospital after her husband found her "unresponsive" Tuesday morning, her publicist told CNN.

Gabor, 93, was taken by ambulance from her Bel Air, California, home to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she had undergone hip replacement surgery earlier this summer, publicist John Blanchette said Tuesday.

The spokesman for Gabor's daughter Francesca Hilton said the doctor told Hilton the situation was "not life-threatening."

Gabor was hospitalized for several days earlier this month for complications relating to the surgery.

Her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, was "very agitated" after calling for an ambulance Tuesday morning, Blanchette said.

Gabor had returned home from the hospital two weeks ago because she "wants to spend her final days at her home," Blanchette said at the time.

She spent three weeks in the hospital after breaking her hip in a fall from her bed on July 17.

She has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, said Von Anhalt. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.

The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders.

Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, "Moulin Rouge;" "The Story of Three Loves" in 1953; "The Girl in the Kremlin" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, "Touch of Evil."
