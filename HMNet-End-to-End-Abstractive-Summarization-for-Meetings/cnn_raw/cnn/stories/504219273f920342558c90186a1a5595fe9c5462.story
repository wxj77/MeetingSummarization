(EW.com) -- Kris Allen was in a car accident on New Year's Day, but though he's bruised a bit, 2013 is already shaping up to be a wonderful year for the former "American Idol" champion.

"Thank you @ford for equipping me with a car that kept my whole family @katyallen @ZorroPup and the little one we have on the way safe," he tweeted last night, letting slip the news that he and his wife are expecting a child. Just in case fans missed the clue, he followed up with, "Yes I got in a really bad wreck tonight and yes I'm having a lil baby. #gonnabeadaddy."

Allen's mother, Kimberly had previously tweeted the car wreck news saying, "From Kris: he's in a lot of pain, arm broke, may not play guitar for a while. Prayers welcome please! #headoncollision," and "Kristopher and Katy are both pretty beat up but ALIVE! Thank you Jesus! They are setting his arm now and will have surgery tomorrow."

Lastly, Allen reassured fans that his injuries would not interfere with his upcoming tour: "Don't worry everyone I may have broken my wrist but the #OutAliveTour is still on."
