(Rolling Stone ) -- In an excerpt from Christopher Andersen's "Mick: The Wild Life and Mad Genius of Jagger" published by the New York Daily News, Andersen claims that Mick Jagger and David Bowie had an ongoing sexual relationship.

Among the various rumors and stories cited, the excerpt points out that Bebe Buell, mother of Liv Tyler and former lover of both Jagger and Bowie, dated the two at the same time, and that the two rockers attempted to lure her into a few orgies. "I used to get some pretty strange phone calls from Mick and David at three in the morning inviting me to join them in bed with four gorgeous black women," reads a quote in the book. "[Or] four gorgeous black men."

But in a Facebook post written today, Buell smashed Andersen's account, strongly dispelling the rumors. "This entire Bowie/Jagger thing is completely stupid and false! Who cares what they did in their private time? I sure don't but I don't like getting dragged into the press when I wasn't part of it. I don't do orgies, never did, never have!" she writes. "Yes, I dated both men but not at the same time. Bowie was more of JUST a friend. Jagger was a BF on and off for years. I hate having to answer to all of this crap! A person's sexuality is their own right and business but I am not anyone's sex toy!"

Mick: The Wild Life and Mad Genius of Jagger was released yesterday. The Rolling Stones recently unveiled an updated logo to mark their 50th anniversary, are showcasing a free exhibit in London through August 27th, and are strongly considering playing at least one live show this year to celebrate their longevity.
