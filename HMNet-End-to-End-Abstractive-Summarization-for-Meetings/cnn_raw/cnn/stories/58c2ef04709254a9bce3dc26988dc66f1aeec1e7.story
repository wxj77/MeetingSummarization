Ford and her husband, Jerry, helped modernize the modeling industry when they began their now-iconic business in in New York in 1946.

A statement from the agency called her "an industry icon and pioneer" whose "contributions to the modeling and fashion industries are unmatched."

"Eileen Ford was an indomitable force who not only defined Ford Models, but the world of modeling itself," a statement on the agency's website said. "The myriad ways Eileen affected the world of fashion and the public perception of beauty are ineffable."

Ford helped modernize the modeling, leading to the evolution of supermodels in the fashion industry.

Ford Model grew into "one of the world's most prestigious agencies" because of her "her unwavering passion, curiosity and drive," the company said.

A quote from Ford accompanied the death announcement: "You never know when or where you will find the next new model, but you can bet someone from Ford Models will be looking."

Ford Models has branches in New York, Paris, Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami.
