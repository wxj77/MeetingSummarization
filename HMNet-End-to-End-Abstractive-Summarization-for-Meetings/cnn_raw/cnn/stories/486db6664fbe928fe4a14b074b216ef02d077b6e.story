(CNN) -- No U.S. military forces died last month in Afghanistan, marking the first such month in more than seven years and the third time since the war began more than 12 years ago, according to the CNN Library, which tallies the casualties.

Here are some other numbers:

• The previous months in which no U.S. deaths occurred during Operation Enduring Freedom were January 2007 and July 2002, CNN Librarian Lindsey Knight said.

• Separately, NATO said one of its service members died Tuesday of a non-battle-related injury in southern Afghanistan.

• Fourteen U.S. combat deaths have occurred this year in Afghanistan, seven each in January and February.

• In all, 2,309 U.S. military members have died in Afghanistan since hostilities began there on October 7, 2001. Three additional Department of Defense civilians have died.

According to NATO's website, its primary goal is to help Afghan authorities provide effective security across the country and ensure that terrorists cannot again use the country as a haven.

Its mission is slated to end at the end of the year.
