(EW.com) -- Guess we'll likely never find out what the Badlands were all about.

Fox has cancelled prehistoric dino drama "Terra Nova" after one season, ending months of will-they-or-won't-they speculation. Studio 20th Century Fox TV, however, says they fight "Terra Nova's" extinction event by shopping the series to other networks.

The decision was handed down despite a few factors that were in the show's favor: A creatively strong two-hour finale, which won over many of the show's grumbling detractors; Fox cancelling Monday night veteran "House"; and another Monday sci-fi drama, "Alcatraz," under-performing in recent weeks. From what we hear, Fox higher-ups weren't too fond of the show.

"Terra Nova" will likely end up the highest-rated cancelled show of the season. It averaged 10.1 million viewers and a 3.6 adult demo rating once you add in a week of DVR playback.
