(CNN) -- iPhone and iPad users looking with envy at the ever-ballooning screen sizes of Android devices shouldn't lose hope just yet.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple has been experimenting with iPhone screen sizes larger than the current four inches, echoing rumors from earlier this year that the company may be looking to supplement its current offerings.

The WSJ also says that Apple is experimenting with larger iPads, specifically a model with a gigantic 13-inch display. While a larger iPhone would be in line with current trends, the trend in tablets has been toward smaller screen sizes, not larger ones.

In either case, those hoping for a bigger iPhone or lap-sized iPad shouldn't necessarily hold their breath.

Apple regularly tests out new screen sizes and even brand-new product lines without ever bringing them to market; those that do see the light of day can take their time emerging from Apple's labs.

The iPad mini itself was the subject of similar speculation in the months and years before it was finally released, and the iPhone 5's 4-inch screen was the subject of rumors that predate the 3.5-inch iPhone 4S.

Apple is expected to update both the iPad and the iPad mini later this year.

Speculation is that the larger tablet will go on the iPad mini diet, shedding some weight, thickness, and bezel width. The smaller tablet, on the other hand, may or may not receive a high-resolution Retina display -- these rumors have been known to change daily based on what the folks at Apple rumor sites see in their tea leaves each morning.

Both tablets were last refreshed in November 2012.

A bad quarter for Apple?
