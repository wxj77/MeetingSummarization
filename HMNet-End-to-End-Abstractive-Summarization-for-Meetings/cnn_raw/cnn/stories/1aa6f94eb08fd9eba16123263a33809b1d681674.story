New Delhi (CNN) -- A series of small bombs went off in and around a world-famous Buddhist temple in eastern India Sunday, injuring two people, authorities said.

Four of the eight explosions occurred at the Mahabodhi temple complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Bihar state that houses a tree where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment.

The temple itself was not damaged.

The other four blasts hit other sacred locations around Mahabodhi, said Bihar police official S.K. Bhardwaj.

A 50-year-old Tibetan and a 30-year-old Myanmar national were injured in the attack, Bhardwaj said.

While no one took responsibility for the attack, suspicion fell on the home-grown Islamist group Indian Mujahideen, Bhardwaj said.

The group, designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, is blamed for dozens of deadly bomb explosions throughout India since 2005.
