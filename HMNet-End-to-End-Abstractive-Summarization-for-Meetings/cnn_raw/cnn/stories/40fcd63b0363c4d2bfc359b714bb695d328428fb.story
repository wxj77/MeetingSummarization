(CNN) -- Green Day's Jason White has tonsil cancer, the band reported on its website.

"We have some news to report regarding our brother Jason White, and wanted you to hear it from us before word spread," the post read. "Jason recently underwent a routine tonsillectomy, and his doctors discovered a treatable form of tonsil cancer. Thankfully they caught it early and he should make a full and speedy recovery."

White, 41, has been an official part of the band since 1999, when he joined them on tour as a guitarist. However, he's been friends with the band members much longer, having been guitarist in Pinhead Gunpowder -- another band fronted by Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong -- and Armstrong's partner in running Adeline Records.

The band, known for such albums as "Dookie" and "American Idiot," asks that fans "join us in sending him love and positive healing vibes during this time."

Green Day is among the nominees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame class of 2015.
