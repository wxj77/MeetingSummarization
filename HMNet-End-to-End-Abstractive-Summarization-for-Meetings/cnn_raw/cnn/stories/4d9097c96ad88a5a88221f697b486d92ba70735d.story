(CNN) -- Kentucky beat Michigan 75-72 Sunday to earn a spot in the Final Four of the NCAA men's basketball tournament.

Earlier in the day, Connecticut beat Michigan State 60-54 to move into the tournament semifinals.

The Final Four games will be played Saturday in Arlington, Texas. Florida will face Connecticut, and Wisconsin will play Kentucky.

The championship game will be played April 7.

On Saturday, Wisconsin beat Arizona 64-63 in the West Region, and Florida defeated Dayton 62-52 in the South Region to earn Final Four berths.

Violence broke out in Tucson Saturday night after the Wisconsin-Arizona game.

Several hundred people blocked a road on the University of Arizona campus, said police Sgt. Pete Dugan.

When they refused officers' orders to disperse and began lobbing objects, police used pepper balls and canisters, Dugan said.

Police reported some damage to property. Those arrested were charged with resisting arrest, unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct.
