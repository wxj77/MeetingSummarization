Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Bermuda's weather officials have relaxed local storm advisories after news arrived that Fiona is downgraded to a tropical depression.

But  Gaston, however, can still regain strength in the next two days and become a tropical cyclone, U.S. forecasters said Friday.

Fiona's center -- which was expected to pass near Bermuda on Saturday morning -- put officials on alert as it promised heavy winds and downpours. But as of 8 p.m. ET, Fiona's wind speed had decreased to about 16 miles per hour.

Fiona's is expected to continue its course north to northeast at about 16 mph with some increase in forward speed, brushing east of Bermuda. Some rainfall is expected.

Gaston, churning westward, is between the Cape Verde Islands off Africa and Lesser Antilles.
