Los Angeles (CNN) -- A 54-year-old acting coach, who's also appeared in bit parts in movies such as "Jurassic Park," has been charged with kidnapping and raping a girl who approached him for lessons, authorities said.

Cameron Thor was charged this week in connection with the attack on a 13-year-old girl in 2008, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said.

According to authorities, the girl met with Thor about attending acting classes. After the meeting, he allegedly drove her to a secluded area and, according to police, sexually assaulted her.

Officials did not say why the incident is only now coming to light.

Sheriff's Deputy Chrystal Hernandez told CNN that Thor confirmed to one of the investigating detectives that he played a small role in "Jurassic Park."

His IMDB profile says he also appeared in "Hook" and "A Few Good Men."

Thor does not have listed representation.

He was arraigned Thursday and is being held on $2.6 million bail.
