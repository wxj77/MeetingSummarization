A landslide caused a passenger train to partially derail in the Swiss Alps Wednesday, injuring at least six people, regional police spokesman Peter Faerber said.

The train was headed from St. Mortiz to Chur in eastern Switzerland when at least two carriages derailed near Tiefencastel, said Simon Rageth, spokesman for the Raethische Bahn rail company.

A rescue operation was under way Wednesday afternoon, said Faerber, a spokesman for police in the Swiss canton of Graubuenden.
