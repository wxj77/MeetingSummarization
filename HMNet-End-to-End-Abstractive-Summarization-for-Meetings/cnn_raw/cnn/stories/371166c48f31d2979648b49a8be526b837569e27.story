(RollingStone.com)  -- U2 have been announced as the headliner for the first night of the 2011 Glastonbury festival, one of the world's largest outdoor music events.

The band will join Coldplay and Beyoncé at the top of the festival's bill, which will take place June 24th-26th in Somerset, England.

U2 were originally scheduled to perform at last year's Glastonbury festival but had to drop out when Bono injured his back. Gorillaz were brought on as a last-minute replacement headliner.

U2's Glastonbury performance will fall in the middle of the next American leg of their 360 stadium tour.

Given that they would need to bring their elaborate production overseas and back again in the span of a couple days, it seems safe to say that the band will be abandoning their 360 stage for this performance.

In other U2 news, an early song written by the band when they were known as the Hype will appear on the soundtrack to "Killing Bono," a comedy film about the two members of the Hype who did not go on to join U2.

The song, "Street Mission," has been bootlegged by U2 fans for years.
