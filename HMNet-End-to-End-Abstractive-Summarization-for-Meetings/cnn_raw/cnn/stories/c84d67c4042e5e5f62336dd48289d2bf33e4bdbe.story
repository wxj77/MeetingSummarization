(CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's TV reality series ended Sunday with the actress laying some very personal cards on the table.

In a scene from the season finale of OWN's docuseries "Lindsay," the 27-year-old explained that the reason she'd missed some filming days for the project was because she'd had a miscarriage.

"No one knows this: I had a miscarriage for those two weeks I took off," she said. "It's a very long story."

During the docuseries, one of the plot points that emerged was Lohan's inconsistency with showing up for work. But as she explained on Sunday's finale episode, it was because she was unable to.

"That's why, on the show when it says, 'She doesn't want to come down,' I couldn't move; I was sick," Lohan said. "Mentally, that messes with you."

OWN's "Lindsay" covered a lot of ground with Lohan, following the actress after she left rehab in July 2013 and moved to New York while trying to repair her career. By the time the last episode aired, Lohan -- along with the rest of the world -- had seen the difficult footage of her post-rehab life.

"I cried so many times watching it," she said. "Watching this series, I just know how I felt at that moment, and I can relate to that girl. Like, 'Oh my God, this is really sad. Who's helping her?' ... There was a lot going on in my life then."

Filming the eight-part series did impart some lessons, and one in particular was how her struggle with addiction could leave her without a career.

"Even if it's not my intention to lose everything I'm now working for, that's what this addiction will do to me. It's a really f***ked-up disease, and it's really scary," she reflected. "(Now) I'm in a good place, and I don't want to mess with that. It feels good, and I'm happy. The biggest thing I've learned from this experience and doing this show is that my work ethic is different. I have that fire back in me."
