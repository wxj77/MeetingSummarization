(CNN) -- Armed forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo beat back dozens of gunmen who stormed three key locations in the capital Monday.

Armed men attacked the country's airport, state TV headquarters and army headquarters in Kinshasa.

At least 34 assailants were killed, according to an Interior Ministry statement.

The statement called on "victims of this terrorist attack ... to know that the assailants had no other purpose than to create panic and terror on the eve of celebrations so important to our culture."

In response, it said that security had been beefed up in the capital.

African Union Commission Chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma condemned the attacks, stressing the AU's commitment to support Congolese efforts to consolidate peace, security and stability.
