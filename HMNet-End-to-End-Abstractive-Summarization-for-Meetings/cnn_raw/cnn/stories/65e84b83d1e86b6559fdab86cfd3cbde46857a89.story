(EW.com) -- The official numbers are in and the winner is ...

NBC, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler!

The 70th Annual Golden Globe Awards last night gave NBC its biggest ratings for the program in six years.

Sunday's awards delivered 19.7 million viewers and a 6.4 rating among adults 18-49 â€” up 28% in the demo from 2012. That makes last night's telecast the most successful Globes since 2007 among total viewers and the valuable adult demo. Last night's Globes is also the season's top awards program to date, eclipsing ABC's CMA Awards, the Emmys and the American Music Awards.

The ratings also mean Fey and Poehler's hosting stint beat the last few years of snark-master Ricky Gervais leading the show. Yet credit for the ratings spike probably deserves to be spread around.

One network analyst cited a combination of factors for the ratings surge â€” the new hosts appealing to female viewers, NBC coming off its best fall performance in nearly a decade and less competition from rivals compared to last year.
