New York (CNN) -- The daughter of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was arrested after police said she shoplifted items at a cosmetic store.

Caroline Giuliani, 20, was charged with one count of petty larceny after the incident at a Sephora skincare and makeup store Wednesday, the New York Police Department said.

She is the younger of Giuliani's two children with his ex-wife, Donna Hanover, a television reporter and actress.

Since his public divorce from Hanover and his marriage to Judith Nathan, Giuliani's relationship with his children has been strained, The New York Times reported in March 2007.

He missed his son's high school graduation and Caroline's plays, The Times reported.

That year, when Giuliani was seeking the Republican nomination for president, Caroline Giuliani's Facebook profile listed her as part of a group that supported then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama's presidential bid.

After Slate.com emailed her about it, she immediately left the group, the website reported.

In August 2007, Giuliani talked about his daughter at a campaign stop in Clear Lake, Iowa.

"My daughter I love very much," Giuliani said. "I have great respect for her, and I'm really proud of her. And I don't comment on children because I want to give them the maximum degree of privacy. I think children in situations like this deserve to have the maximum degree of privacy. And the best way to preserve that is, except to point out that you love them and care about them and you're very, very proud of them, just don't comment about it."

Sephora representatives declined to comment.

Giuliani's office did not return calls Wednesday.
