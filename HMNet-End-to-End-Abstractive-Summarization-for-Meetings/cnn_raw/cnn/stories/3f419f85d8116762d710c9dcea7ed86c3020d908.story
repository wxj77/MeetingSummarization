Whether you want a cosmopolitan city, a central spot from which to explore nature or a hidden gem not yet discovered by great hordes of tourists, Lonely Planet's top 10 cities for 2015 has a spot for you.

Lonely Planet's 10 picks include well-known favorites with something extra to share, smaller cities known only to locals and a select few tourists and cities you simply must visit.

To compile the annual top 10 list, Lonely Planet asked its worldwide staff, contributors and authors for their well-known and lesser-known recommendations, and spots that have something special to offer in 2015.
