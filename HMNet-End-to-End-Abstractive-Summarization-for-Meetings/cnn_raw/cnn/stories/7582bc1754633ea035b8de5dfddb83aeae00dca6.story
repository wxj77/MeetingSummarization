The Jersey Shore: For beachside water parks on the pier

The beaches along the Jersey Shore have definitely bounced back from last year's storm damage with style -- some of them even made our list of America's Most Awesome Boardwalks, and Ocean City, New Jersey was featured as one of BT's favorite beach towns.

This Labor Day weekend, pay a visit to one of New Jersey's many beachside waterparks, like Raging Waters and the Ocean Oasis Waterpark & Beach Club at Morey's Piers in Wildwood, for a fun way to cool off in the hot summer sun, whether you prefer to relax in the lazy river or take on adrenaline-pumping attractions like the Cliff Dive slide and WipeOut. Waterpark passes start at $39 for adults and $35 for children under 48". Seniors over age 65 get in free with a valid photo ID.

Families with toddlers and small children should opt for Asbury Splash Park -- try the $50 family fun pack that includes four passes to Asbury Splash Park, four passes to the onsite mini-golf course, four beach access passes, a daily parking pass and discounts at vendors along the boardwalk.

Admission to Asbury Splash Park costs $5 for adults, $9 for children, or $20 for a family day pass for two adults and two children.

Enjoy live musical performances by local bands, and treat the kids to family-friendly activities, Radio Disney shows, an obstacle course from the Port Discovery Children's Museum and special insider access to the Baltimore Convention Center, where they can get an up-close-and-personal look at the race cars before they go out.

Music lovers rejoice. For three days over Labor Day weekend (Friday - Sunday), more than 30 bands will take the stage for the Verizon Wireless American Music Festival, playing all kinds of music -- rock and roll, jazz, blues country, and R&B -- by local, regional and national bands on a giant beachfront stage on 5th Street as well as several outdoor stages at the 17th Street Park, the 24th Street Park and the 31st Street Park.

Highlights include three big-name bands that will highlight each night: Fuel opens for Daughtry on Friday night, Smash Mouth opens for the Barenaked Ladies on Saturday night, and Third Eye Blind performs with Robert Randolph & the Family Band on Sunday night.

Miami: For brunches and bike rides on the beach

Miami is the perfect place to party year-round, and Labor Day weekend is no exception.

Each year Nikki Beach Miami hosts its Labor Day Endless Summer Party, a farm-to-table Sunday brunch featuring made-to-order omelettes, crepes, Belgian waffles, rotisserie free range roasted chicken, slow roasted prime rib, hand-rolled sushi and among other culinary delights, a dessert station loaded with everything from macaroons to French apple tarts.

The event takes place Sunday, September 1, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. with live music and beach-side entertainment while you eat.

From $49.95 per person; Mimosas, House Champagne and gourmet Blood Mary's cost an extra $7 each with the purchase of a brunch ticket.

Should you suddenly have the urge to work off everything you've just eaten, take Miami's public bike sharing program, Decobike Miami Beach, for a spin and rent a bike anywhere from 30-minutes to a full day.

Thirty-minute passes are available for $4; one-hour passes for $6; two-hour passes for $10, four-hour passes for $18; and one-day passes are available for $24.

Looking for a calmer beach experience? Stake out the perfect spot on any of Miami Beach's seven miles of sand. The best part: it's free.

Park City: For historic parades and the Running of the Balls

Labor Day is more commonly referred to as Park City Miner's Day in this part of Utah -- a tradition dating all the way back to 1898.

Each year there's a celebration in honor of the area's rich mining heritage, complete with a community pancake breakfast, live music, races and games for the kids, the Funky 5K Fun Run and the annual Miner's Day Parade down Historic Main Street.

Perhaps the most intriguing part of the celebration is the annual Running of the Balls, a charity fundraising event held on Monday at 10:45 a.m. where participants "adopt" a ball for $5 (or 5 balls for $20), and watch in awe as thousands of them are released down Main Street, racing to the bottom of the hill.

The first ten to reach the bottom of the street are tracked, earning their owners a grand prize of airline tickets, season ski passes or any number of other donated surprises.
