(CNN) -- All four of the children wounded in a mass shooting in east Texas have died, police confirmed Thursday.

Lt. Andrew Lewis, a Bay City Police spokesman, said the deceased children were 2, 3, 4 and 5 years old. He did not identify them. The 2-year-old was a girl and the 4-year-old a boy, he said.

The children's mother was wounded in the shooting Wednesday afternoon and airlifted to a hospital in Houston, according to police. Her condition was not available Thursday evening.

The apparent gunman, who killed himself at the scene, was identified Thursday as Jose Avila, 24, the mother's husband. His relationship to the children, if any, was not disclosed.

The shooting occurred at a mobile home in Bay City, about 65 miles southwest of downtown Houston. Police responded at 3:18 p.m. (4:18 p.m. ET) Wednesday to a call that a woman had been shot.

When they arrived, they also discovered the four children and the apparent shooter, who died at the scene from a single gunshot to the head, Lewis said.
