(CNN) -- The trial for Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach accused of molesting several boys, has been postponed until June 5.

The trial was scheduled for May 15 but it "must be postponed to accommodate various logistical contingencies," court documents said.

Joe Amendola, Sandusky's lawyer, said the delay may still not be enough time.

"We don't know if we will have all the information we need and are entitled to receive prior to the new trial date, but we will do our very best to be ready to proceed to trial on June 5," Amendola said.

Amendola argued that prosecutors have been investigating the case long before Sandusky was arrested but he has had little time to prepare his case.

"The Attorney General has conducted a three-plus-year secret grand jury investigation in this matter. We've only had a couple of months since we received our first discovery materials in mid-January to begin preparing our defense," Amendola said.

Sandusky, a longtime defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions, is currently under house arrest as he awaits trial on more than 50 counts of child sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty.

The allegations against Sandusky led to the firing of Penn State's heralded head football coach Joe Paterno only months before he died of complications from lung cancer.

Former school officials Tim Curley and Gary Schultz are charged with perjury and failure to report a crime in relation to the investigation.

In February, Penn State said it has incurred nearly $3.2 million in combined legal, consultant, and public relation fees pertaining to the scandal.

Almost $2.5 million of the fees stem from Penn State's internal investigation and crisis communications team costs. Roughly $500,000 has been spent on university legal defense services, the university said.
