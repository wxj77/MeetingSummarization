(CNN) -- From cattle rancher to campaigner: Defiant Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy has taken his anti-government message on the campaign trail.

And he didn't rule out revolution.

At a northern Nevada campaign stop, Bundy said he didn't "ever want to see" one but did say "if we don't rein back this federal government, then we the people are going to have to fight."

Bundy spoke Tuesday at the Bonanza Casino in Reno for tea party candidate Russell Best, a poorly funded long-shot candidate for Nevada's 4th Congressional District, CNN affiliate KRNV reports.

Best faces Republican Cresent Hardy and first-term Democratic incumbent Rep. Steven Horsford, who is favored to win, according to race handicappers.

"Basically fight for liberty and freedom, and we're fighting against a federal government that's overreached," Bundy told the crowd of about 50 people.

Bundy became a hero to some conservatives in March when he was locked in an armed standoff with the federal government after allowing his cattle to illegally graze on government-owned land. His mainstream support, however, diminished after he made racist remarks.

Bundy's Reno campaign stop was the first of a four-city rural Nevada tour for tea party candidates.
