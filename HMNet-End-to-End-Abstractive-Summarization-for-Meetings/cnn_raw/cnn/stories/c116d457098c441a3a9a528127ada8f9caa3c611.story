(CNN)  -- Reigning Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund opened the new season with a convincing 3-1 home win over SV Hamburg Friday night.

Midfielder Kevin Grosskreutz scored twice with 19-year-old Mario Goetze grabbing the other goal with an impudent finish.

Hamburg, who were second best for most of the match played before a capacity 80,720 crowd at Signal Iduna Park, grabbed a late consolation from midfielder Robert Tesche.

"We played really well. We took the foot off the gas a little in the closing stages, but there is plenty to be positive about," Dortmund defender Mats Hummels told AFP.

Goetz, who has been rewarded by a call up to Germany's squad for Wednesday's international against Brazil, showed just why as he set up Grosskreutz for the opener on 17 minutes.

Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa hit the post for dominant Dortmund before it was Goetze who set the stadium alight as he played a one-two with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and chipped Jaroslav Drobny in the Hamburg goal for the second.

Grosskreutz sealed the three points with a 48th minute strike with Goetze again involved.

He played a one-two with Kagawa and when the ball came to Grosskreutz  he shot home at the second attempt.

Tesche headed home Hamburg's goal on 79 minutes after Kagawa had earlier cleared off the line.

But Dortmund comfortably held out for a deserved victory which sends a signal to their other title rivals that they will be difficult to dislodge after their runaway title win of last season.

Bayern Munich, deposed by Dortmund, open their campaign Sunday against Borussia Moenchengladbach.
