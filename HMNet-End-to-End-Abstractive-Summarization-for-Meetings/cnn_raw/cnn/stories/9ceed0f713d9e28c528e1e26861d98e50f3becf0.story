CHICAGO, Illinois (Reuters)  -- Grammy Award-winning R&B singer R. Kelly will go on trial September 17 on child pornography charges, five years after the accusations were first made, prosecutors said Wednesday.

Jury selection in R. Kelly's trial is scheduled to begin September 17.

Kelly, 40, whose real name is Robert Kelly, faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted of videotaping himself having sex with an underage girl. Prosecutors have said the girl could have been as young as 13, but defense attorneys have disputed her age and whether Kelly is on the tape. The underground videotape was widely circulated.

Kelly pleaded not guilty to the charges and in the interim has released hit songs, gone on tours, and released a DVD set of "hip-hopera" skits.

Cook County Judge Vincent Gaughan said jury selection would begin September 17.

The trial was delayed, in part, by arguments over when the video was made. It was also pushed back because the judge fell and broke bones and needed to recuperate. E-mail to a friend
