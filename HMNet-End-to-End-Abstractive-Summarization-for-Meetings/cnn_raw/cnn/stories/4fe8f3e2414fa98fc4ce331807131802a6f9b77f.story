(CNN) -- The odds turned against a bettor after police say he was caught on camera using special contact lenses to cheat at a Connecticut casino.

Bruce Koloshi, 54, of Summit, New Jersey, who was known in other casinos as a card marker, was observed by Mohegan Sun Casino surveillance playing at a "Mississippi Stud" table game, Connecticut State Police said in a statement. Upon reviewing the video footage, it was determined that Koloshi was marking cards with an ink-type substance that was made visible through special contact lenses that he was wearing, the statement said.

After he was arrested, Koloshi provided a false name, but his true identity was revealed through his fingerprints, police said. Koloshi had an outstanding warrant in Louisiana on gaming-related charges, police said.

Koloshi was charged in Connecticut with being a fugitive from justice, cheating, conspiracy and criminal impersonation. He was arraigned on Monday and did not enter a plea. He is currently being held on a $300,000 bond, according to the Norwich Superior Court.

Koloshi's attorney, John Maxwell, declined to comment. Koloshi is expected to appear in court on September 27.
