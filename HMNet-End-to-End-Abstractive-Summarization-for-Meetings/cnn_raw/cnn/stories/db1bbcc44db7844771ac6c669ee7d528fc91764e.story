(CNN) -- Adam Levine has a new title. "Sexiest Man Alive," according to People magazine.

It's the first time the Maroon 5 frontman and coach on NBC's "The Voice" has been named the magazine's "Sexiest Man Alive."

"As a musician, you have fantasies that you want to win Grammys, but I didn't really think that this was on the table," the singer told People.

"I was just amazed and stunned and it almost seemed like they were kidding, but they weren't, so that's cool."

In the People interview, Levine credited yoga and spinning with helping him keep up his stamina -- and physique.

The magazine hits newsstands Friday.
