Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Police in Indonesia have confirmed that a man arrested on Wednesday is one of the most wanted terrorists in the country.

He is Abdullah Sonata, an explosives expert with links to the late militant Noordin Top, responsible for terror bombings until he was killed last year by police.

Sonata was thought to have recently returned from the Philippines and started recruiting and training militants.

Police said they became engaged in a gun battle after they launched a raid in the central Javan district of Klaten. One person was shot dead and three were arrested, including Sonata.

Initially, police weren't sure the man in question was Sonata but said they intended to confirm his identity by fingerprinting him.

Noordin, killed in September, had been accused of involvement in July's twin suicide bombings at the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta, the 2002 Bali nightclub bombing and attacks on the same Marriott hotel in Jakarta

in 2003, as well as the Australian Embassy in 2004.

In the past year, police have launched a nationwide crackdown on militants, in which they have arrested or killed dozens of high-profile militants in the country, the most populated Muslim nation in the world.
