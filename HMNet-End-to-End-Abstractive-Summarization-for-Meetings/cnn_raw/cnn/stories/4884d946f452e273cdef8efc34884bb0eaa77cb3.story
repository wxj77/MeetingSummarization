As you would expect for a loyal caddie of 12 years, Steve Williams is backing Tiger Woods to bounce back from his slump in form as he prepares for the new season.

Woods' annus horribilis was completed when he relinquished his world number one status to England's Lee Westwood in October after a record-breaking 281-weeks at the top.

As the fall out from his divorce from ex-wife Elin Nordegren continued, Woods failed to win a single title and was even beaten to the tournament he hosts by U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell last week.

But after showing an upturn in form as the season neared its end, Woods' caddie Steve Williams is confident his man has what it takes to start winning again in 2011.

"Last week was the first time he's played three good rounds in succession this year," he was quoted as saying on New Zealand news website stuff.co.nz.

"It's been a difficult year and hard to focus on the task, but it's all started to come together so I'm excited for 2011."

Woods opted to remodel his swing after finishing tied fourth at The Masters in Augusta back in April and Williams says he knew then that the rest of the season would be a rebuilding process.

Williams added: "He's working on a new swing, and it takes time to be able to put that swing into play over an extended period. It's not easy to take it from the range to the course. He's just got more confidence with it."

But despite a rollercoaster year Williams says he has enjoyed the challenge of helping Woods to battle back to the top of the rankings.

And he says motivation isn't a problem for either of them as they target a much improved year in 2011.

"Tiger wants to beat Jack's [Nicklaus] record, so that's what makes you work hard and get up early and train in the gym," Williams said.

"You only get four tournaments a year to get those wins, so it's an easy job to get motivated in."
