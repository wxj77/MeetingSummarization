(CNN) -- If the word "club" conjures images of ear-shattering music, dense smoke and multiple charges of FUI (Flirting Under the Influence), consider this article an aspiration setter.

The private members club is an elite place, soaked in prestige and exclusivity.

Servicing only a small, select group of people, attaining membership isn't easy. And that's precisely the point.

"Most maintain their exclusiveness through an application process that begins with recommendations by at least two current members followed by an approval by the club's committee," says Vincent Lai, managing director of concierge service Quintessentially Lifestyle, Greater China.

"Those who are invited fulfill certain requirements, they usually have economic capital but most importantly they carry a lot of social clout," he adds.

"Membership allows one to dine, drink and play at a city's most exclusive addresses, with excellent facilities and usually a late license. The cache of knowing you've been let in -- that's always a big attraction," says Emyr Thomas, director of Bon Vivant concierge service.

There are more exclusive clubs than these, such as The Giga Society, a high IQ club that is, in theory, only open to one in 1 billion people.

But this is a selection of some of the world's most exclusive clubs that don't require mammoth brains, special educational histories or other fortuitous qualifications.

Though for some a fat wallet would be advantageous.
