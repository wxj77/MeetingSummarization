(CNN) -- American football is continuing its love affair with London.

The NFL announced Tuesday it will stage another regular season game in the British capital in 2014.

The Jacksonville Jaguars, Atlanta Falcons and Oakland Raiders will each host a home game at Wembley Stadium next season.

A regular season game was first played in London in 2007 but, for the first time this season, two games were scheduled on the opposite side of the Atlantic.

The Minnesota Vikings played to a sell-out crowd in September as they finally ended their season drought with victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Jackonsonville Jaguars face the San Francisco 49ers on 27 October. Both NFL games at Wembley Stadium sold out within hours.

"Our fans in the UK have continued to demonstrate that they love football and want more," NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said.

"Both of this year's games in London sold out quickly. The fan enthusiasm for our sport continues to grow.

"By playing two games in the UK this year, we are creating more fans. We hope that with three games in London next year we will attract even more people to our game."

The sport is hungry to increase its global profile and the appetite for American football in London suggests the feeling is mutual.
