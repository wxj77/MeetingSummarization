(CNN) -- Faith Hill will sing "America the Beautiful" during the pregame show at the Super Bowl next month, according to the National Football League.

Faith Hill is a Grammy Award-winning artist and the voice of "Sunday Night Football's" theme song.

The NFL announced Wednesday that singer-actress Jennifer Hudson will deliver the national anthem before the start of Super Bowl XLIII on February 1.

The NFL already had announced that Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band would perform at halftime at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.

Hill, a Grammy Award-winning artist and the voice of the theme song for NBC's "Sunday Night Football," delivered the national anthem before Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2000.

The only other artists who have sung "America the Beautiful" before a Super Bowl are Vikki Carr (Super Bowl XI), Ray Charles (Super Bowl XXXV) and Alicia Keys (Super Bowl XXXIX).

The 2009 Super Bowl will be broadcast in 230 countries and territories, the NFL said. More than 148 million American viewers watched the 2008 game, it said.
