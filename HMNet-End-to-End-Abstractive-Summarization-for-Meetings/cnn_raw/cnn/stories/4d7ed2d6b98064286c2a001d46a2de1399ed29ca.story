Washington (CNN)One New York City luncheon is getting more spice than usual and it has nothing to do with the menu.

Mitt and Ann Romney, along with Chelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky, will attend a New York City luncheon Friday for the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. News of the meeting was first reported by the New York Times.

Two sources familiar with the event confirmed to CNN that the Romneys would attend the luncheon and a spokesman confirmed that Clinton and Mezvinsky would also attend.

Mezvinsky, who married Clinton in 2010, is on the center's board, along with Spencer Zwick, a Romney confidant and his 2012 finance director.

The luncheon -- which was meant to be private, according to the hospital -- will come just days after Romney, who is floating a possible third run at the presidency, dinged Hillary Clinton, who is floating her own 2016 run, in a Mississippi speech.

"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cluelessly pressed a reset button for Russia, which smiled and then invaded Ukraine, a sovereign nation," Romney said about Chelsea's mother at Mississippi State University.

Romney later knocked Clinton for a comment she made -- and then amended -- in 2014 about business not creating jobs.

"How can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all," Romney asked, "if she doesn't know where the jobs come from in the first place."

Ann Romney was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1998, and said in an interview with CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger in 2012 that her husband was an important part of her efforts to regain control of her life. The Romneys founded the center at Brigham and Women's Hospital in 2014.
