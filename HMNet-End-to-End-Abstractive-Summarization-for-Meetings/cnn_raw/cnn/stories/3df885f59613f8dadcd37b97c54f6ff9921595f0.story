(CNN) -- Ladies and gentlemen, the Rolling Stones are back on tour.

The "world's greatest rock 'n' roll band" resumed its #StonesOnFire trek, part of its 50th-anniversary travels around the globe, with a show Monday night in Oslo, Norway. The group's tour had been put on hold since the March 17 death of Mick Jagger's girlfriend, fashion designer L'Wren Scott.

Scott's death, which was ruled a suicide, stunned Jagger, who had been with the designer and former model since 2003.

"I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way. We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me," he said in a statement two months ago.

Scott left her $9 million estate to Jagger, according to the late fashion designer's will. Though she had reportedly been having financial difficulties, a representative for Scott said, "The figures quoted in the media regarding the financial status of LS Fashion Limited are not only highly misleading and inaccurate but also extremely hurtful and disrespectful to the memory of L'Wren Scott."

The Stones were in Australia at the time of her death, and the band canceled seven shows there and in New Zealand. The shows have been rescheduled for October and November, according to the Stones' official site.

The Stones' Oslo set list included "Jumpin' Jack Flash," "All Down the Line," "Let's Spend the Night Together," "Emotional Rescue" and a version of "You Can't Always Get What You Want" accompanied by the Edvard Grieg Youth Choir.
