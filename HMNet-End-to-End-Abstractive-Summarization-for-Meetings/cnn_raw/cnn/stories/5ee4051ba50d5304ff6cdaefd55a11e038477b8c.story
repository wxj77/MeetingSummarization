(CNN) -- "Saturday Night Live," NBC's long-running sketch comedy show, has added three performers to its cast, the network announced Monday.

Aidy Bryant, Tim Robinson and Cecily Strong -- each a veteran of the comedy scene in Chicago -- will join the show for its 38th season.

All three performers have ties to the famed Second City improv troupe. Robinson and Strong were members of the group's national touring company and Bryant was an ensemble member of the Second City E.T.C Stage. She also performed in improvised musicals with the group Baby Wants Candy. All three also performed with the iO improv team.

They will have big shoes to fill. "Saturday Night Live" lost key cast members Kristen Wiig, Andy Samberg and Abby Elliott.

The new SNL season debuts this Saturday with host Seth MacFarlane and musical guest Frank Ocean.
