(CNN) -- A charter plane carrying county government workers crashed on the Hawaiian island of Lanai on Wednesday night, killing three people and injuring three more, Maui County spokesman Rod Antone said.

The pilot and two Maui County Department of Planning workers were killed when the plane crashed about 1 mile south of an airport of Lanai City, according to a news release from Antone.

The injured were taken to a hospital. Two of them, who also were planning workers, were in critical condition Thursday morning. The third, an attorney, was in serious condition, the county said.

No names were released. Information about what led to the crash wasn't immediately available.

The group had attended a planning commission meeting on Lanai earlier Wednesday, and the plane -- a twin-engine Piper PA31, according to the Federal Aviation Administration -- was to bring them back, the county said.

The plane took off from Lanai Airport at about 9:05 p.m., and one of the injured passengers called 911 to inform authorities about the crash at 9:23 p.m., the county said.
