(PEOPLE.com) -- Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber squeezed in some very public displays of affection at a hockey game in Canada on Saturday night, but just one day earlier, they made a decidedly more private outing to a local animal shelter -- and quietly adopted a dog.

Winnipeg animal rescue D'Arcy's A.R.C. got a surprise visit from the young lovebirds, who stopped by for some canine therapy.

"They spent a lot of time with the puppies," the rescue's chief executive officer, D'Arcy Johnston, tells PEOPLE. "I was told that [Gomez] was missing the dogs that she has at home."

Gomez, who is currently on tour and performed in Winnipeg over the weekend, owns five rescue dogs and has advocated publicly on behalf of animal rescue. During the hour she and Bieber spent at the shelter, they zeroed in on a 10-week-old husky mix and fell in love -- puppy love, that is.

"I wasn't expecting her to adopt a dog while she was on tour and has a busy schedule," Johnston says. Gomez went through the standard screening process and was able to leave with the puppy, which she named Baylor, that day.

"Baylor probably would have had a bad life or a very short life," Johnston says. "But he got rescued and brought to our shelter and is now going to live a very good life."
