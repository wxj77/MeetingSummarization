(CNN) -- Bayer Leverkusen regained second place in the Bundesliga on Sunday, with a 4-2 win at home to struggling Stuttgart.

Stuttgart twice battled back from behind, but goals in the last ten minutes of play from Stefan Reinartz and Stefan Kiessling ensured victory for coach Jupp Heynckes' side.

The 2007 German champions Stuttgart now find themselves joint bottom-of-the-table with Monchengladbach, who inflicted a surprise 2-1 defeat at home to Champions League side Schalke.

A goal from Peer Kluge gave mid-table Schalke a second-minute lead, but Gladbach leveled through Marco Reus before Mohamadou Idrissou scored to give his team their first home-win of the season.

Just five points now separate the bottom five teams in the Bundesliga, with Stuttgart and Monchengladbach level at the foot of the table with just 19 points.

Although up to second place Leverkusen still lie 10 points adrift of league leaders Borussia Dortmund -- who extended their lead with a home win over St. Pauli on Saturday -- but have a three point cushion over third-placed side Bayern Munich.
