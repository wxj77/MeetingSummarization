(CNN) -- Usain Bolt ended his season on a high note with a comfortable 100 meters victory at the final Diamond League meeting in Brussels on Friday.

The Jamaican sprint king, who said this week he wants to retire at the top after the 2016 Olympics, went close to his best time of 2013 as he clocked 9.80 seconds.

It was just 0.03s slower than the time he set in regaining his world title in Moscow last month.

"If I had got a better start it would've been 9.70," he said after the race.

"I can definitely run faster. I started my season pretty poorly and got injured at the start so it was not the perfect season or the best of my career. But the best thing is I finished on top and dominated."

Bolt is a popular figure at the Belgian event, where he set a meeting record time of 9.76 in 2011.

"I still enjoy doing this -- this is one of the best crowds and it gave me the energy," he said.

The 27-year-old was 0.1s quicker than second-placed American Michael Rodgers, whose 9.90 was his season's best.

Bolt's compatriot Nesta Carter was given third place after sharing a time of 9.94 with Moscow silver medalist Justin Gatlin of the U.S. while Jamaican Kemar Bailey-Cole was fifth in 9.98.

Gatlin, however, had the consolation of winning the $40,000 prize for being the overall Diamond League champion over the distance, with Bolt second.

Bolt's win completed a 100m double for Jamaica, as Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce consolidated her place at the top of the women's standings with victory.

The 26-year-old, who like Bolt won three golds in Moscow, set a meeting record of 10.72 to head off American Alexandria Anderson (10.92) and fellow Jamaicans Carrie Russell (10.99) and Kerron Stewart (11.19).

Fraser-Pryce's time was just outside her personal best of 10.70 and 0.01s behind her leading effort this year in Moscow. She added the 100m Diamond League crown to the 200m title she had already sewn up.

Bolt didn't enter the men's 200m in Brussels, which was won by his compatriot Warren Weir -- who clinched the overall title for the distance.

However, the country's on-track success was tempered by Friday's news that the five athletes who tested positive for prohibited substances in June have had confirmation that their "B" samples also showed the presence of the drugs.

The Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission has sent confirmation letters to the quintet, according to a report in the Jamaican Gleaner.

The group includes former 100m world record-holder Asafa Powell and ex-Olympic relay champion Sherone Simpson, who have both protested their innocence.
