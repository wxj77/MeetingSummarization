(CNN) -- Move over, Steve Rogers. Let the Falcon take wing.

The Falcon, aka Sam Wilson, is taking over as Captain America from Rogers, Marvel announced Wednesday.

The new hero isn't just far younger than Rogers, who "must surrender his blues for a sturdy cane," Paul Montgomery wrote on Marvel.com; he's also an African-American very much in tune with the modern world.

"While Sam shares many of Steve's beliefs in a general sense, he's also a very different person with a very different background," editor Tom Brevoort said on the website. "He didn't grow up in the 1930s, he's a modern-day man in touch with the problems of the 21st century. For most of his professional life, Sam has worked as a social worker, so he's seen the worst of urban society up close, and how crime, poverty, lack of social structure and opportunity can affect the community."

The Falcon debuted in 1969 in "Captain America" #117. He was Marvel's first mainstream African-American superhero.

Right away he found himself going against Captain America's nefarioius Nazi foe, Red Skull, when a trip to a tropical island pitted him against the "Exiles," a group of former Nazis who had been affiliated wtih the archvillain. Wilson triumphed in that adventure and became friends with Captain America.

Over the years, with the help of his faithful falcon friend, Redwing, Wilson has fought crime on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D. and other Marvel organizations.

In the 2014 movie "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," the Falcon was portrayed by Anthony Mackie.

Rogers isn't leaving the fold. He'll be a "remote strategic advisor," according to Brevoort.

This is the second time in a week that Marvel has changed up its universe. On Tuesday, the company announced that the new Thor will be a woman.
