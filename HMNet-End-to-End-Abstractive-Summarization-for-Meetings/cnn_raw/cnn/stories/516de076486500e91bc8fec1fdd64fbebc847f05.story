(CNN) -- Experience getting up early is about to come in handy to Savannah Guthrie.

The "Today" anchor gave birth Wednesday to a daughter named Vale Guthrie Feldman. It's the first child for Guthrie and husband Mike Feldman. Guthrie shared the news on social media and tweeted "My 3am wake up call sounds a lot different now. Sweeter."

Her co-anchor Matt Lauer revealed on the show Thursday that he was texting with Gutherie prior to the birth when she went silent. When he inquired as to why, she texted him a picture of her daughter's foot.

"It was Vale's foot...and I just sat there smiling," Lauer said.

Gutherie tweeted a picture of the new baby. She announced her pregnancy on air in March at the same time she announced that she and Feldman had tied the knot.
