(CNN) -- Unbeaten Juventus returned to the top of Italy's Serie A with a 1-0 win at third-placed Lazio on Saturday.

Midfielder Simone Pepe netted the only goal from close range in the 34th minute after a cross by striker Alessandro Matri.

It put the Turin club one point clear of Udinese, who beat Roma 2-0 on Friday, and three ahead of Rome side Lazio.

Juve, seeking a first league title since 2003 and 28th overall, can extend that lead to four points on Tuesday with victory away to Napoli.

Napoli moved up to seventh as striker Edinson Cavani netted a 90th-minute equalizer in the 1-1 draw at Atalanta.

The Uruguay forward followed up his match-winning double in the midweek Champions League triumph over Manchester City, but the Naples side now trail Juve by nine points.

Atalanta had taken the lead in the 64th minute through on-loan Udinese striker German Denis, who scored against his former club.

Catania claimed sixth place with a 1-0 win at second-bottom Lecce, as Pablo Barrientos scored in the last minute.

Novara moved out of the bottom three with a 2-1 win over Parma, as striker Raffaele and midfielder Marco Rigoni scored in the final 20 minutes after veteran captain Matteo Centurioni put through his own net in the first half.

Champions AC Milan can join Udinese on 24 points with a home victory against Chievo on Sunday.
