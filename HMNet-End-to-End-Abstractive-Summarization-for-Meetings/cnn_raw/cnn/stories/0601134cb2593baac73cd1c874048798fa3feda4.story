(CNN) -- A group of Columbus, Ohio, police officers hopped on the Powerball bandwagon, but unlike the majority of ticket buyers, the players will walk away from the frenzy $1 million richer.

The majority of approximately 20 officers work either in the department's forgery or auto theft unit, according to department spokesman Sgt. Rich Weiner.

"It's nothing anyone can really retire from, but a lot of people are going to have a nice holiday season," said Weiner, who was not involved in the pool that purchased the tickets.

The group's ticket had the five winning numbers, but their Powerball number was one off from the winning Powerball 6 -- a not-so-lucky number 5, according to Weiner.

The group planned to come forward late Thursday, according to the Ohio Lottery Commission. Once confirmed, they officers will share the winnings.

Wednesday night's drawing produced 58 $1 million tickets and eight $2 million tickets, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.
