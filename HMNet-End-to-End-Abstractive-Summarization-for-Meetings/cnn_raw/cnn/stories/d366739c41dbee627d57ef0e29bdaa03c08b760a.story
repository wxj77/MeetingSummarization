(CNN) -- Formula One's new tire provider Pirelli has simulated rainfall in the desert to test its wet-weather products ahead of the 2011 season.

The Italian company, which returns to the elite motorsport after a 20-year absence as official supplier in place of Bridgestone, coated the Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi in water for the unprecedented two-night session.

Pedro de la Rosa, who raced for Sauber last year, was at the wheel for the final test on Tuesday.

The 39-year-old Spaniard drove a Toyota TF109, the last car made by the Japanese manufacturer before it exited Formula One in 2009.

The tests, which took place between 6 p.m. and midnight local time, were designed to investigate how the tires handled hot and cold tarmac.

"We decided to do it this way because we want to challenge our rain tires with the most difficult and demanding of all situations," Pirelli's F1 team director Paul Hembery told the company's website on Monday.

"And who knows, perhaps it could be a good idea for a future grand prix? These tests will provide us with useful information to finalize our tire development process for Formula One.

"It is seven months since we started developing our tires and five since we started with the actual testing. We are very satisfied with the results so far."

De la Rosa took part in 14 races with Sauber last year before being replaced by Nick Heidfeld after the Italian Grand Prix in September.

Heidfeld, De la Rosa and former Renault driver Romain Grosjean have been testing Pirelli's range of tires over a period of nine sessions, from wet and intermediate rubber to super-soft and soft compounds.

The Yas Marina circuit has been the setting for the final grand prix of the racing calendar since 2009, and was the scene of Sebastian Vettel's maiden world championship triumph last November.

The 12 Formula One teams set to compete in the 2011 season should be present for the first official pre-season test in Valencia, Spain on February 1.
