(CNN)"Fraggle Rock," the long-in-the-works adaptation of the Jim Henson 1980s puppet TV show, is getting a shot in the arm with the help of Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

The actor has come aboard to star in and produce the feature adaptation. He joins New Regency and The Henson Co., who also are producing.

"Rock" was a Canadian series that became a hit internationally (it played on HBO in the U.S.). It followed the adventures of a group of cave-dwelling puppet creatures called Fraggles. In their world was a race of small, industrious creatures named Doozers, who lived in the caves, as well as the Gorgs, furry giants who looked at Fraggles as nuisances.
