Whether they get a charge out of lunching beside an Oscar-winning actress or are simply using her choice of venue like a glorified Yelp review, people love supping with celebrities.

Restaurants love them too.

Problem is, publicizing "celebs eat here" information only ensures that the guests of honor never return.

So you have to do more these days than examine the walls of a dining establishment for autographed photos to find out what kind of personage it attracts.

That's what we've done, scouring gossip sheets, shaking down publicists and pushing the outer limits of local harassment laws in pursuit of the eateries favored by celebrities.

And that term isn't limited simply to entertainers.

The word "celebrity" is a sliding one that shifts with changes in geography, subculture and industry.

They'll be happy to welcome Chris Pratt at the TGI Fridays in Palo Alto, but in most of Silicon Valley it's Larry Ellison who really gets jalapenos popping.
