The Clintons and Monica Lewinsky will be sharing the stage this summer, but probably not in the way you would expect.

"Clinton: The Musical" will make its U.S. debut at the New York Musical Theatre Festival in July.

"It's history. Sort of," the musical's tagline says on the festival's website.

The show's description reads, "It's hard enough being president by yourself. Bill Clinton's problem is that there are two of him. Literally. 'Clinton' follows two Bill Clintons and Hillary on their quest to save their presidency, change America and prove that 'politics is show business for ugly people.' "

The political satire by Australian brothers Paul and Michael Hodge was nominated for best new musical at the 2012 Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland.

The production was transferred to London's King's Head Theatre in 2013 before making its way to America.

The musical features two Bill Clintons -- W.J. Clinton as the smart and presidential man the American public knows well and the unruly, oversexed "Billy."

Karl Kenzler will play W.J. Clinton, while Duke Lafoon will be "Billy" Clinton and Alet Taylor is Hillary Clinton.

In addition to the Clintons, notable characters in the musical include Lewinsky, Eleanor Roosevelt and Newt Gingrich.

Performances will run July 18-20, July 22 and July 25 at the Alice Griffin Jewel Box Theatre in New York. Tickets are $25.

The former first family has no involvement with the production, and a representative for the Clintons did not immediately respond to CNN seeking comment.
