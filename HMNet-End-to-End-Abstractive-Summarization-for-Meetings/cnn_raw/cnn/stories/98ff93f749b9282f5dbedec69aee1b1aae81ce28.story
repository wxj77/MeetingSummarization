(CNN) -- After 18 months of waiting, users of Android phones and tablets can finally crash the Instagram party.

On Tuesday the fast-growing, photo-sharing network for the iPhone and iPad finally launched an app for Android devices. The free application works with Android version 2.2 and higher and is available for download at Google Play, Google's new online store for digital media.

"We've been meticulous about translating the Instagram experience to the Android platform," said a post Tuesday on Instagram's blog.

"The Android app offers an extremely familiar Instagram experience when compared to the iOS app. You'll find all the same exact filters and community as our iOS version."

Instagram lets users enhance their mobile photos with filters, share them with their friends or other people and comment on friends' pictures. Like Twitter, Instagram also allows people to follow other users.

Instagram has exploded in popularity since Apple honored it as its 2011 App of the Year. The app now has more than 30 million users, up from 15 million four months ago.
