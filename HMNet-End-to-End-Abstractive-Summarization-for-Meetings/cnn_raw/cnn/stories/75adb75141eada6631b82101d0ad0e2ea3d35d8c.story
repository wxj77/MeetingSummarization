(EW.com) -- Monday's Emmy tribute to Robin Williams will be presented by a fellow famed actor-comedian: Billy Crystal.

Executive producer Don Mischer announced the programming decision on Tuesday morning, having previously promised that the award ceremony would honor the late performer with "the proper and meaningful remembrance he so well deserves."

Williams will be honored during the "In Memoriam" portion of the show. Sara Bareilles will handle the musical accompaniment to the segment. Bareilles recently dedicated her song "Hercules" to Williams (though the song choice for the segment has not yet been announced).

Last year, Williams honored Jonathan Winters during the same Emmy segment.

The 63-year-old was found dead in his home on August 11.

The 66th Primetime Emmy Awards airs August 25 on NBC.
