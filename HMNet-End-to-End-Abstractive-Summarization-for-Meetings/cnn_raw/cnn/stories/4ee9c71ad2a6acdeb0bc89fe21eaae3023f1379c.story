New York (CNN) -- Whether evoking loss or hope, music performed Sunday at Manhattan's ground zero served as soothing support for family members still grieving 10 years after the 9/11 attacks.

A somber Paul Simon, wearing a 9/11 Memorial cap, performed "The Sound of Silence," a change from "Bridge Over Troubled Water" listed on the program.

People in the crowd cried, embraced or sang along. Others milled around the water memorials at the World Trade Center's towers. Many did paper rubbings of victims' names or left flowers.

Sixty bagpipers and drummers led a processional at the beginning of the ceremony. The Brooklyn Youth Chorus sang "The Nation Anthem" and cellist Yo-Yo performed a Bach selection.

As is customary, people who lost relatives that day read their names aloud.

Linda Spinella, 52, of Wayne, New Jersey, talked about her brother Mark Zangrilli, 36, who worked in the South Tower.

"Too many people lost too many people," said Spinella. Her brother's name was one of the last to be read. By then, many people had left the memorial service.

"He had a really contagious laugh," Spinella said. "He loved his kids and he was good to his parents."

Other musical performances included James Taylor's "You Can Close Your Eyes" and flutist Emi Ferguson's rendition of "Amazing Grace."

The service concluded with the chorus singing "I Will Remember You" and four trumpets playing taps.
