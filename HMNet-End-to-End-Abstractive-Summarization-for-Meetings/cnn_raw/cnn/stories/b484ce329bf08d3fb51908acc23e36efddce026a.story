(EW.com) -- Get ready for this: J.K. Rowling is in the midst of penning a "Harry Potter" encyclopedia, confirming the long-standing rumor on her official website.

"For a long time I have been promising an encyclopedia of Harry's world, and I have started work on this now," said Rowling in the FAQ section of the site. "Some of it forms the new content in Pottermore. It is likely to be a time-consuming job, but when finished I shall donate all royalties to charity."

If you aren't already having heart palpitations from the news, then I hate to break it to you, but there's a highly probable chance that you're actually a Squib.

Potter fans have been waiting for years for Rowling to revisit the magical world she created, and social website Pottermore has only managed to slightly quench our literary thirst. With this announcement, Rowling has unofficially revitalized the Potter fandom (not that it ever went away) with not just a book, but an entire freaking encyclopedia to look forward to. Even if we have to wait for that other book of hers to be completed first.

Shelf Lifers, how are you reacting to this news? Is this the greatest Potter-themed announcement since the final movie's release? Are you already planning your outfit for the midnight launch party? It's time to dust off the old Charity Burbage costume!
