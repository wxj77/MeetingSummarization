(CNN) -- A 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck Saturday in the Mediterranean Sea, some 50 miles (80 kilometers) south southwest of Avsallar, Turkey, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.

The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 32 miles (51 kilometers) in the seismically active region, it said.

Video shot in Antalya and aired by Turkish broadcaster DHA showed chandeliers shaking.

Turkey is no stranger to seismic events. A magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Izmit, Turkey, killed more than 17,000 people in 1999, according to the USGS. A magnitude 7.2 tremor in Duzce the same year killed 894 people, the USGS reported.
