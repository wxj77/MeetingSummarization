(CNN) -- Authorities arrested more than 100 members and associates of the street gang the Mexican Mafia in southern California as part of investigation into a wide range of offenses such as racketeering, kidnapping, attempted murder and drug trafficking, federal officials said.

The arrests were made primarily in San Diego County and were the culmination of three major investigations on gang activity in the area, U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said Wednesday.

In early morning raids, federal and local authorities rounded up 104 suspects.

The charges are detailed in 17 indictments and eight criminal complaints filed by the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego. In all 119 suspected gang members were charged and authorities were trying to track down the remaining fugitives, Duffy said.

The suspects are part of 20 major street gangs that were overseen by the Mexican Mafia, authorities said.

"Gangs were made to pay taxes in order to facilitate their trafficking and violent behavior," said San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore.
