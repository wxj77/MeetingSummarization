A woman shot by her former boyfriend in a Chicago Nordstrom store has died, the retailer said on its verified Facebook page.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends," the post read.

The bustling store was packed with holiday shoppers late Black Friday, when a man opened fire on the seasonal employee before turning the gun on himself, Chicago officials said.

He targeted "his girlfriend or ex-girlfriend" on the second floor, according to John Escalante, the Chicago police chief of detectives.

He died at the scene, and the woman was initially critically injured, said spokesman Larry Langford of the Chicago Fire Department.

She was taken to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

Panicked shoppers bolted when gunfire rang out.

"I'm a big guy, and people were knocking me over," shopper Scott Balloch told CNN affiliate WLS. "My feeling was just get the hell out of there."

Nordstrom said that store will remain closed until further notice, according to the affiliate.
