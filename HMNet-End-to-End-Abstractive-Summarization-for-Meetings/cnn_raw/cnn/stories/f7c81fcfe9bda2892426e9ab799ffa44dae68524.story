(CNN) -- The 2014 CMA Awards could turn into a very big night for Miranda Lambert.

The "Somethin' Bad" songstress leads this year's group of nominees with nine nominations, matching the number of nods she got in 2010. Before Lambert's 2010 windfall, no female artist in the history of the CMA Awards had received that many nominations in one year. (Alan Jackson holds the record for most CMA Awards nominations overall, thanks to the 10 he earned in 2002.)

Coming in behind Lambert is Dierks Bentley, who earned five nominations, and Eric Church and Keith Urban, who have four nominations each.

Urban and Lambert are both nominated for 2014's entertainer of the year award, along with Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton (Lambert's husband), and George Strait, who won the honor at last year's ceremony.

And that's not all: Lambert's June release, "Platinum," is nominated for album of the year, and her track "Automatic" is nominated for best single and best song of the year. For album of the year, she'll compete with Luke Bryan's "Crash My Party," Keith Urban's "Fuse," Eric Church's "The Outsiders" and Dierks Bentley's "Riser."

In the female vocalist category, Lambert's up against Martina McBride, Kacey Musgraves, Taylor Swift, and Carrie Underwood. Underwood is also hosting this year's show, alongside Brad Paisley.

The 2014 CMA Awards, which will be the 48th edition of country music's biggest night, will air live from Nashville on ABC on November 5.
