CNN Student News wraps up the week with reports on frigid temperatures in the U.S., a manhunt in France, and the search for a lost aircraft in the Java Sea. We bring in the subjects of medicine and science with news on the mumps. We cover a bit of history concerning the Gregorian calendar, and we show you what the first day back to work looks like in the U.S. Capitol.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
