(EW.com) -- The final season of "Mad Men" will be expanded to 14 episodes, but you'll only get half of it next year. AMC announced today that it will split the seventh season of the Madison Avenue-in-the-'60s drama into two parts, with the first half airing in spring 2014 and the second half debuting in spring 2015.

This programming move mirrors the network's strategy for doling out the final 16 installments of Breaking Bad. The crime drama unveiled eight episodes in summer 2012 and began rolling out the final eight in August to its highest ratings ever.

"This approach has worked well for many programs across multiple networks, and, most recently for us with Breaking Bad which attracted nearly double the number of viewers to its second half premiere than had watched any previous episode," said AMC president Charlie Collier in a statement. "We are determined to bring Mad Men a similar showcase. In an era where high-end content is savored and analyzed, and catch-up time is used well to drive back to live events, we believe this is the best way to release the now 14 episodes than remain of this iconic series."

Added series creator/executive producer Matthew Weiner: "We plan to take advantage of this chance to have a more elaborate story told in two parts, which can resonate a little bit longer in the minds of our audience. The writers, cast and other artists welcome this unique manner of ending this unique experience."
