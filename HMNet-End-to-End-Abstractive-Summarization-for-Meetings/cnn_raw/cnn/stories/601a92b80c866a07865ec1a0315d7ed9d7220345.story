New Zealand police are investigating three incidents of suspicious packages -- one containing a document referencing Ebola -- that arrived at Parliament, a newspaper and the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday.

The package that arrived at Parliament in Wellington was received in the mailroom and had, along with a document that mentioned the deadly virus, a small plastic bottle with a tiny amount of liquid in it, authorities said. An explosives squad was called in to secure the package.

Inspector Marty Parker with the police communication center in Wellington told CNN that the U.S. Embassy there also reported receiving a package "possibly" containing liquids. Parker said it's too early to tell whether that incident is related to the others.

The New Zealand Herald reported that the package it received in Auckland is a suspected hoax, but it has handed it over to police for investigation.
