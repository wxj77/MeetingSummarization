(CNN) -- A Polaroid picture of the late Dennis Hopper was stolen from a Los Angeles art gallery and the photographer, actor Jason Lee, is offering $25,000 to the photograph back.

"You've taken the one single physical document of the photographer's time with his subject. This is not a print, as there is no negative. There is only this single image," the gallery said in a letter on its website addressed to the thief. "There is no way that this Polaroid will ever have the same worth to you that it holds for Jason."

Lee, who starred in the TV show "My Name Is Earl," loaned the picture to the art gallery and is very sentimental about it, the gallery, which is called This Los Angeles, said.

The theft occurred on Feb. 4 when "someone stole a piece off the wall and bolted out the front door," the gallery said.

The gallery said Lee is offering a $25,000 reward for the return of the photo.

Lee's publicist said the actor was crushed about the loss of the large black-and-white portrait of the legendary actor.

"Jason is devastated and sickened by the theft," said Nancy Iannios. "It has great sentimental value to Jason."

Lee said Hopper also liked the photo.

"As a huge Hopper fan, I was honored to create my one-off large format Polaroid of him. And I was flattered that he liked it as much as he did. He was a great artist," Lee said.
