(CNN) -- AC Milan stayed just one point behind Serie A leaders Juventus with a convincing 3-0 win over Cagliari in the San Siro Sunday.

Juve had kept up the pressure with a 2-1 win over Udinese Saturday, but Milan responded in style.

Star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic set them on their way as he curled home a 20 meter free kick in the first half.

Antonio Nocerino doubled their lead before halftime and Massimo Ambrosini added a fine third in the 75th minute.

But Milan's city rivals Inter saw their seven-match winning run ended with a 1-0 defeat at strugglers Lecce.

Guillermo Giacomazzi scored for Lecce just before the break and they held out for a valuable win.

Lazio stayed in fourth, eight points behind the leaders, with a 3-0 win at Chievo.

Hernanes put them ahead in the first half with a late double from Miroslav Klose sealing the three points.

In Germany, Borussia Monchengladbach kept pace with the leading three in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-0 win at Stuttgart.

Star striker Mike Hanke gave the visitors the lead in the first half with Marco Reus and Igor de Camargo adding further goals after the break.

Valencia substitute Aritz Aduriz salvaged a point for his side in a 2-2 draw at Racing Santander in La Liga Sunday.

Both teams ended with 10 men after Pedro Munitis for Santander and Valencia's Ricardo Costa both saw red in injury time.

Aduriz then cropped up to score the leveler as his team stay third, five points ahead of Levante, who earlier lost 2-1 at home to Getafe.
