(CNN) -- Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak gave the Montreal crowd something to shout about by sealing a quarter-final place in the Rogers Cup tournament.

It was the first time in two decades that a native had got so far in the tournament and it sets up a commentator's nightmare as she takes on similar-sounding Caroline Wozniacki, the former world No.1.

Wozniak overcame American Christina McHale in straight sets 7-6 6-3 in her third round encounter on Saturday after rain prevented her from finishing the job on Friday night.

Meanwhile, Wozniacki overcame a problem with her right leg to beat American Varvara Lepchenko 4-6 6-3 6-4. At one stage, Wozniacki received treatment on court for the injury, but it didn't stop the Danish player completing the task.

It was a simple win for tournament second seed Agnieszka Radwanska, who secured a 6-2 6-4 win over Chanelle Scheepers, who has not won against top 20 seeds in the past 24 encounters.

Frenchman Richard Gasquet booked his place in only his second senior final by beating the service game of American John Isner.

The bronze-winning Olympian posted a 7-6 6-3 victory win Saturday. He is still waiting to find out who he will face in the final as rain hit the other semi-final between Novak Djokovic and Janko Tipsarevic.
