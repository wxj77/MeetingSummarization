(CNN) -- New fall comedy "Selfie" isn't done yet.

The ABC series was canceled in early November, but Hulu has stepped in to air the show's remaining episodes.

"Selfie" creator Emily Kapnek tweeted the news on November 20, telling fans, "Unofficially? All remaining episodes of #SelfieABC will soon be on Hulu, Hulu Plus & http://ABC.com Hugs to Peter Roth @warnerbrostv."

ABC initially ordered 13 episodes of Kapnek's updated take on "My Fair Lady" and pulled the plug around episode 7. The remaining six episodes will now roll out one by one each week on Hulu and ABC's websites.

The series, which starred John Cho as a marketing executive who helps a social media star (Karen Gillan) rebrand her image, never took off in ratings, but it did eventually find a devoted audience.
