(EW.com ) -- If you've ever had the burning desire to see one of the hottest film stars of the moment bray, "I am not an animal!" you're in luck. Bradley Cooper, who just received his second Oscar nomination in as many years for his fussy, conflicted G-man in David O. Russell's American Hustle, will be returning to Broadway after an eight-year absence, the actor's reps tell EW. (His last appearance was opposite Julia Roberts and Paul Rudd in 2006â€²s Three Days of Rain, for which he got very good notices.)

EW: See full stage coverage

The red-hot actor will headline a revival of Bernard Pomerance's The Elephant Man, playing John Merrick, the severely deformed, soulful figure memorably embodied on film in David Lynch's 1980 film version by John Hurt. The play, unlike the film, has the leading actor suggest deformity through physicality without the aid of makeup or prosthetics, so you'll get to see Cooper in all his golden-boy glory, just like in the large pic right here, which highlights Mr. Cooper's 2012 performance in the play at the Williamstown Theatre Festival. This marks the second Broadway revival of Pomerance's Tony-winning play, after a 2002 production starring Billy Crudup and Kate Burton, who were both nominated for Tonys for their work.

EW: Bradley Cooper, Patricia Clarkson join 'The Elephant Man' in Williamstown

No word yet on whether Patricia Clarkson (who played Mrs. Kendal, the actress who befriends Merrick) or Alessandro Nivola (who played Dr. Treves, and also happens to costar in Hustle with Cooper) will rejoin People's former Sexiest Man Alive for the Broadway run, but further details are promised at a later date.
