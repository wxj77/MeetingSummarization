(CNN) -- One person was killed and at least 20 homes destroyed after a weekend tornado that struck a town in eastern Kansas, state officials said.

The storm also damaged another 200 homes around Reading, about 100 miles southwest of Kansas City, said Sharon Watson of the Kansas Division of Emergency Management. She said the agency received a report of a tornado touching down at 9:15 p.m. Saturday.

The agency said five others were injured in addition to the fatality, and power was knocked out to much of the town of about 250. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback issued a disaster declaration for 16 counties on Sunday, a step toward getting state and federal aid for the affected areas.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim and everyone impacted by this storm," Brownback said in a statement issuing the declaration.

The National Weather Service said the storm was caused by an EF-1 tornado, which packs winds of 86-110 mph. It was among several storms that hit the area between 6 p.m. to midnight Saturday, authorities said.

"The first significant calls of damage came in about 6:30 p.m. local in Shawnee County," Watson said. "There was significant damage caused by large hail, which broke windows and broke tree limbs."

In Jefferson County, a mobile home was destroyed and an elderly couple was trapped inside, Watson said. She said first responders cleared the debris and rescued the couple, who was not hurt.
