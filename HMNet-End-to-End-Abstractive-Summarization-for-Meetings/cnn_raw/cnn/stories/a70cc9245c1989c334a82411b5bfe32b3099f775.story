Beyoncé has delivered the ultimate holiday surprise.

Just after midnight on the east coast, the singer suddenly dropped a brand new 14-track self-titled album on iTunes. That's right — without any pre-promotion.

As if this bombshell — which, in her Instagram announcement, she described as a "visual album" — needed anything else, each song also comes with a music video and a download of BEYONCÉ will also score you three additional videos.

Here is the full track list. Notably, there's a duet with husband Jay-Z and a cameo from daughter Blue Ivy:

1. Pretty Hurts

2. Haunted

3. Drunk in Love (feat. Jay Z)

4. Blow

5. No Angel

6. Partition

7. Jealous

8. Rocket

9. Mine (feat. Drake)

10. XO

11. ***Flawless (feat. Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche)

12. Superpower (feat. Frank Ocean)

13. Heaven

14. Blue (feat. Blue Ivy)
