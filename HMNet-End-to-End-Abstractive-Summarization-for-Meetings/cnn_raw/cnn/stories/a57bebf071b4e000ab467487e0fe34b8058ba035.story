(CNN) -- The 9-year-old boy who sneaked onto a plane for a trip to Las Vegas is back in his hometown of Minneapolis, a family spokesman said Saturday night.

Spokesman V. J. Smith would not provide details. He said he would speak with the boy's father Sunday.

Crew members aboard a Delta Air Lines flight October 3 became suspicious of their child passenger and then found that he had no ticket or boarding pass. He was placed in a foster home as authorities began an investigation.

The Transportation Security Administration has said the boy went through security at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, although it has not explained how he did so without a boarding pass.

An airport spokesman said video shows the boy chatted with a Delta agent when he reached the gate and moved toward the plane when the agent became distracted.

Father: 'No one stepped up to help'

'He's got a behavioral problem,' dad says
