(CNN)Talk about intense competition.

The award-winning cousin of President Obama's dog was in the mix. So was the famed pooch of kidnapped heiress, bank robber and actress Patty Hearst.

But in the end, a 15-inch beagle named Miss P strutted away with the Best in Show award at the 139th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on Tuesday night.

Miss P, full name "Ch Tashtins Looking for Trouble," is only the 2nd ever beagle to win the most prestigious award, beating out winners from six other dog groups.

Among the other finalists: Portuguese water dog Matisse, the cousin of Obama's dog Sunny. Matisse won the "working group" category for the third straight year.

Miss P also defeated Rocket, the shih tzu co-owned by Hearst. Rocket won the "toy group" category Monday.
