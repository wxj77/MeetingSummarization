The sixth suspect in the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old woman is a minor and will be tried in juvenile court, police said Monday.

The 17-year-old boy, whose name has not been released, was arrested by police in December and accused of taking part in the December 16 assault aboard a New Delhi bus.

Police said the suspects attacked the woman and her male companion on a bus, robbed them and dumped them by the side of the road.

The woman was badly injured in the attack. She died two weeks later after being flown to Singapore for treatment. The man survived.

The five adult suspects are being tried in a "fast-track" court designed to bypass red tape.

Hearings began last week, but details about what happens in court cannot be reported under a judge's ruling imposing restrictions on coverage of the case.

The case has gripped India and led to calls for stricter laws on sexual assault and changes in cultural attitudes toward women in India, where most women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations.
