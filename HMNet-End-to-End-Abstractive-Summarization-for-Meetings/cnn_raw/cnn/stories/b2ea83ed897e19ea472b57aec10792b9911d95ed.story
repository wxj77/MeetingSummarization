(EW.com) -- Fox has renewed its Sunday reality kingpin "Family Guy," as well as another Seth MacFarlane title, "American Dad."

But the broadcaster is postponing making a decision on "Family Guy" spinoff "The Cleveland Show."

"Family Guy" will be back for an 11th season, and "Dad" for an eighth (been that long? Wow...); both pickups are for the standard 22 episodes.

"Cleveland" is a more uncertain. Fox could be simply waiting until after the upfronts are over to quietly let its option to pick up the show lapse, or could simply be postponing the decision until it needs to be made. There's enough episodes in the pipeline to keep "Cleveland" on the air for a fourth season next year, so even with the long production time of Fox's Sunday night animated comedies, there's some wiggle room to delay the verdict.
