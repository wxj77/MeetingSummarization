Banjul, The Gambia -- A judge has sentenced to death eight men, including The Gambia's former army chief, for their parts in a coup plot in the western Africa nation last year.

The eight men are Lt. Gen. Lang Tombong Tamba, former chief of defense staff of The Gambia armed forces; Brig. Gen. Omar Bun Mbye, former deputy chief of defense staff; Col. Lamin Badjie,  former head of military intelligence at The Gambia armed forces; Lt. Col. Kawsu Camara, former head of Kanilai Family Farm; Modou Gaye, former deputy inspector general of police; Gibril Ngorr Secka, former head of mission at the Gambian Embassy in Guinea Bissau; and Abdoulie Joof and Yousef Ezziden, both of whom were businessmen.

"After going through the evidence of the prosecution and the defense, I find all the accused persons guilty and accordingly sentence them to death on all three counts," said Justice Emmanuel Amadi.

The men were convicted under Gambian law of treason-related charges.

The men have 30 days to appeal.

The men broke down in tears as the judgment was read, as did their relatives in the courtroom.
