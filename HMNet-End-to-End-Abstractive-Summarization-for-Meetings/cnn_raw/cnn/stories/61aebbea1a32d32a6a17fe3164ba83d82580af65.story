(CNN) -- Superstorm Sandy forced many residents along the East Coast to leave their homes, raising questions of what to do with their pets. After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, some began to suspect people were reluctant to evacuate and leave behind their pets.

The 2006 PETS Act made it mandatory for local and state governments to include plans for pets in their emergency procedures. It also opened the gates for FEMA funds to be put toward the welfare of animals in disaster zones.
