(CNN) -- The last of three prisoners who escaped from Indiana State Prison earlier this month has been captured, authorities said Thursday.

Lance Battreal, from left, Mark Booher and Charles Smith escaped from an Indiana prison July 12.

The U.S. Marshals Service captured Mark Booher, a  murderer, around 11 a.m., said Shannon Robinson, supervisor for a marshals service fugitive task force.

Booher was taken into custody without incident in a hotel room on the north side of Indianapolis, Indiana, she said.

He had been sentenced in 1999 to 65 years for murder and robbery.

Booher escaped on July 12 from Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Indiana, along with Lance Battreal, a rapist, and Charles Smith, also a murderer.

Battreal was serving a 50-year sentence for his convictions in 1998 for rape, criminal confinement and stalking.

Smith was captured the day after the jail break about eight miles away in southwestern Michigan. Battreal was captured Tuesday at his parents' home in Rockport, Indiana.

The inmates apparently escaped through underground tunnels, officials said. The prison was built around 1860, and the tunnels -- lined with brick and concrete -- carry pipe chases and sewer lines.

Two of the escaped inmates had worked in the tunnels as assistants to maintenance employees, said John Schrader, spokesman for the Indiana Department of Correction.
