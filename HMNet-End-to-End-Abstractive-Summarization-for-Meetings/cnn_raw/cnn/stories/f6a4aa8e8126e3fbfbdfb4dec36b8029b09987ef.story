(CNN) -- Emergency officials report at least 27 people in nine states have died as a result of Hurricane Irene.

North Carolina -- 6

Pennsylvania -- 5

Virginia -- 4

New York -- 3

Vermont -- 3

Connecticut -- 2

New Jersey -- 2

Maryland -- 1

Florida -- 1

Authorities are trying to determine whether an additional death reported in New York is connected to the storm.

Here is a state-by-state breakdown:

New York

-- A 50-year-old man was electrocuted Sunday while trying to aid a father and son who came in contact with a downed power line on a flooded street in Spring Valley in southern New York, police there said.

-- The body of woman who apparently drowned after she either fell or was swept into a storm-swollen creek was recovered Sunday near New Scotland, New York State Police said.

-- One man in Croton, New York, died Sunday while boating along with four others down the Croton River, said Lt. Russell Haper, a spokesman for the Croton police. The boat overturned in the strong rapids. The 53-year-old man was found dead after a three-hour rescue effort. The other men were pulled safely from the water.

-- Authorities are trying to determine whether the drowning death of a windsurfer whose body was discovered Sunday in New York's Bellport Bay is related to Irene, Suffolk County Police said. This death is not included in the fatality count until the determination is complete.

Pennsylvania

-- One person was killed in an overnight traffic accident in Carbon County, said Ruth Miller, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency.

-- In separate incidents, a man in a camper and a man in a tent were crushed when trees fell on them, Miller said.

-- A 64-year-old woman was found dead Sunday by Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, police after her family grew concerned when she did not show up for work. Her body was found a half-mile from where her car was abandoned in a deluged creek, police said.

-- Miller did not immediately have details on the fifth death, but said it was a storm-related fatality.

Connecticut

-- Gov. Dan Malloy told reporters that state police were reporting an apparent storm-related fatality "related to downed wires."

-- A man in Bristol, Connecticut, was killed Sunday when the canoe he and another man were riding in failed to clear a bridge on the Pequabuck River and flipped, Bristol Police Department spokesman Edward Spyros said. The man's death appeared to be an accidental drowning. The other man surfaced alive.

Florida

-- Witnesses spotted a 55-year-old surfer face down in the water Saturday off New Smyrna Beach, Florida, said Capt. Tamara Marris, a spokeswoman for the Volusia County Beach Patrol. He was nonresponsive and had a large cut on his head when emergency personnel examined him. Marris said the death was connected to the storm because "the surf that we had this morning was a remnant of Hurricane Irene."

Maryland

-- A woman in Queenstown, Maryland, died Saturday night after a large tree knocked a chimney through the roof of her home, crushing her, according to Kevin Aftung, the chief of emergency Services for Queen Anne's County.

New Jersey

-- A woman was killed when floodwater swept away her car, Gov. Chris Christie said Sunday. Christie had said earlier that a firefighter was killed while attempting a water rescue, but later said he was given "bad information." The firefighter remains in intensive care.

-- A 47-year-old Orange, New Jersey, man died after leaving his submerged car to wade through floodwater to reach the post office where he worked, Kearny police said. The man's co-workers said that shortly before the entrance to the building, the man stepped into a concealed drainage creek and disappeared. Despite a two-hour rescue effort and an attempt by one of his co-workers to save him, the man's body was found about 100 yards from his car.

North Carolina

-- One person was killed when a tree fell on a car driving down a highway in Sampson County, North Carolina, state emergency management spokesman Ernie Seneca said.

-- A child died in a car crash at an intersection in Goldsboro, North Carolina, where the hurricane had knocked out power to the traffic light, Goldsboro Police Capt. Anthony Carmon said. The crash occurred when a car carrying a family drove through the intersection and struck another vehicle, Carmon said. Several people inside the car sustained injuries.

-- A motorist died after he lost control of his vehicle and struck a tree in Pitt County, Seneca said.

-- A man feeding livestock in Nash County died when he was struck by a tree limb, Seneca said.

-- A man in Onslow County died of a heart attack as he put plywood over his windows in preparation for the storm, Seneca said.

-- A sixth person was killed in North Carolina, Gov. Bev Perdue said. CNN affiliate WITN reported that the man was found dead in Pitt County after winds from Irene toppled a tree onto his house.

Vermont

-- The body of a woman who was swept into the river in Wilmington has been found, the state's emergency management office said Monday.
