Washington (CNN) -- A new political ad against Republican Scott Brown could easily have been an attack ad against Mitt Romney in 2012.

One of the toughest spots to hit Brown this cycle, the 30-second ad paints the former senator from Massachusetts as a "yes man" to a large corporation that has outsourced jobs.

While the ad never mentions Romney, who campaigned for Brown this summer, the outsourcing attack was a key strategy used by Democrats two years ago when Romney, a former private equity executive, was running for president.

In the ad, released by Senate Majority PAC, the Democratic group highlights Brown's ties with Kadant, a Massachusetts paper company that named Brown to its board of directors last year.

Brown was ousted from Congress in 2012, but he's now fighting to reclaim a spot in the Senate, this time from New Hampshire where he's challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.

A $500,000 ad buy, the spot starts airing Tuesday on cable and broadcast and will run for two weeks. It's the group's fifth ad against Brown this cycle and comes as the Republican is in a dead heat with Shaheen, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll.

New Hampshire Republicans have made their own outsourcing attacks against Shaheen. They point out that when she was governor of New Hampshire, part of the state's food stamp program was outsourced to India.

Elizabeth Guyton, communications director for Brown's campaign, says the attack ad shows that "Shaheen is getting desperate" and "her D.C.-based special interest group allies have resorted to attacking Scott Brown with negative and false ads."
