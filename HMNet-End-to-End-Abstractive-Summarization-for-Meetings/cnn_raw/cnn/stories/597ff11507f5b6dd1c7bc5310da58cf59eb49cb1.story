(CNN) -- French international Karim Benzema scored twice for Real Madrid as Jose Mourinho's side defeated Racing Santander 3-1 in the Spanish Primera Liga on Sunday.

The away victory lifts Real, who were without top-scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, back to within seven points of leaders Barcelona at the top of the table.

Emmanuel Adebayor, who is on-loan from Manchester City, tapped home a simple goal to give the visitors the lead after 23 minutes, although the Togo striker was later to miss a penalty kick

Benzema, 23, scored his first of the match after latching onto a through-ball from playmaker Mesut Ozil in the 28th minute.

The home side then missed a penalty of their own before Kennedy Bakirciouglu got one back with 20 minutes remaining.

Real made sure of the win five minutes later, when Benzema scored his seventh league goal of the season after good work from Argentina winger Angel di Maria.

Elsewhere, Athletico Bilbao moved into fifth position after a 2-0 success over Sevilla at San Mames, a victory which ended a run of four successive defeats.

An own-goal from Argentine defender Federico Fazio put the Basque side ahead just after the hour mark, before a penalty from Andoni Iraola wrapped up victory with two minutes left.

Bilbao leapfrogged Espanyol, who went down 1-0 away to Levante thanks to a first-half goal from Felipe Caicedo.

Sporting Gijon earned another three points in their battle against relegation after a 2-0 triumph over Getafe.

The match was over by half time thanks to first-half strikes from Miguel de las Cuevas and Andre Castro.

Malaga are bottom of the table after a last minute goal from Sergio condemned them to a 1-0 defeat at home to Osasuna, who moved up to 14th position.

Meanwhile, Almeria moved above Malaga as they came from behind to win 2-1 at Hercules.
