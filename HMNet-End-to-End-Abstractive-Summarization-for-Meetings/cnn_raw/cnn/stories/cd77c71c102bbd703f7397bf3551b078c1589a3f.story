(CNN) -- The nominees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's class of 2013 have been announced, and for the first time ever fans will get a say in who will be inducted.

To be eligible for a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nomination, artists must have released their work at least 25 years prior to appearing on the ballot. That means this year's hopefuls released their first single in 1987 or earlier. Blues guitarist Albert King has been eligible since 1987, while 2013 marks the first year the seminal hip-hop acts N.W.A. and Public Enemy are eligible.

From today through December 5, fans can vote at several sites including Rockhall.com to boost their favorite artists' chances of making the cut. The top five acts selected by those votes will become part of a special "fans' ballot" that will be counted alongside the international voting body of more than 600 artists, historians and industry members.

The winners will be revealed in December and the 28th Annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony will be held in Los Angeles at the Nokia Theatre L.A. LIVE on Saturday, April 18, 2013. The show will be broadcast on HBO at a later date.
