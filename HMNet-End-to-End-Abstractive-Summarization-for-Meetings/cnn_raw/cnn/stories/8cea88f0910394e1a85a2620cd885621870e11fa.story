(CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, have left on their honeymoon, the royal family announced Tuesday.

But St. James's Palace would not say where they went.

William, the second in line to the British throne, married Catherine Middleton in London April 29, in a wedding that brought much of the United Kingdom to a flag-waving, street-partying, television-watching halt.

They spent the weekend after the wedding on vacation in the United Kingdom, according to the royal family.

They are due to travel to Canada this summer, their first official foreign trip since getting married.
