A suicide bomber killed two police officers when he detonated his explosive-laden car in an Afghan province Saturday, a government spokesman said.

The early morning explosion near the entrance of a police command in Nangarhar province wounded eight more people, said provincial spokesman Ahmadzia Abdulazai.

The Taliban, who took responsibility for the attack, claimed a higher death toll. They boasted that they had killed 10 officers and wounded dozens in the area near the border with Pakistan.

The Taliban and their Pakistani Taliban counterpart, Tehrik-e-Taliban, often carry out terrorist attacks in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

This week, a top-level Pakistani Taliban leader was captured by U.S. forces in a military operation, a State Department spokesman said Friday.

Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan confirmed its deputy chief, Latif Mehsud, was arrested in Afghanistan's Khost province in the border region.
