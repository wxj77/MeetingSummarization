(CNN Student News) -- December 4, 2014

Today's show explores what it's like inside a war-torn Syrian town, where Kurds and other ethnic fighters have been resisting attacks by the ISIS terrorist group. We incorporate a bit of astronomy when reporting on a NASA project. We explain why China has banned its media from using puns (!), and we feature a Character Study on a blind man who kayaked the Colorado River.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
