(CNN)Way to make us weep, Taylor Swift.

As if she didn't smash 2014 enough with a blockbuster album and dominance of the headlines, Swift had one final gift for the world on December 31.

The superstar posted a video of her gift-giving to fans, which has become known as "Swiftmas."

Here's how it worked: After the successful release of her "1989" album, Swift did some "Tay-lurking," in which she followed some fans on social media, taking in personal details including likes and dislikes.

The video features the singer wrapping gifts for some of her fans and shipping them to the adoring bunch. In one case, Swift personally travels to Connecticut to deliver gifts to the young son of one adoring fan.

As you can imagine, there are squeals, tears and total meltdowns over the generosity of a celeb who has become known for breaking down the wall of fame (she famously hosted tons of them in her various homes for private listening parties before to the release of her new album).

So cheers to you, Taylor Swift. We suspect that you are about to rock 2015 like no one's business.
