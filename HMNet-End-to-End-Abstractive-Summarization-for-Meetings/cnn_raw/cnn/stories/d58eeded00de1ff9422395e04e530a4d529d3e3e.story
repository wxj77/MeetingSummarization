(EW.com) -- Now that you've cast your ballot for the president of the United States, it's time to turn you attention to another, equally important competition: the People's Choice Awards. With categories ranging from "favorite movie" to "favorite music fan following," your voice needs to heard.

Maroon 5 frontman and "The Voice" judge Adam Levine leads the list of nominees with six nods in both the music and television categories, while Justin Bieber is the top individual nominee with five music nods. The two artists with will go head-to-head in the favorite album and favorite music video categories, forcing you to choose between the two men with the best head of hair and the highest pitched voice in the industry. Too bad Justin Timberlake isn't in the running.

People's sexiest man alive, Channing Tatum, leads the male actors with four nods and Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence are tied with three nominations in the exact same categories. Glee and The Avengers are the most popular TV show and film, respectively.

Voting begins today for all 48 categories and will end on Dec. 13. The show, hosted by The Big Bang Theory's Kaley Cuoco for the second year in a row, will be broadcast by CBS on Jan. 9, 2013.
