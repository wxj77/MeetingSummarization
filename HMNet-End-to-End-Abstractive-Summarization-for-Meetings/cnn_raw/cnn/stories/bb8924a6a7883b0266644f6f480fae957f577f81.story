(CNN) -- Defending motorcycle champion Marc Coma of Spain won Wednesday's 362km fourth stage of the Dakar Rally from San Juan to Chilecito, although the Spaniard still trails KTM team-mate Cyril Despres in the overall standings.

The 35-year-old finished over two minutes ahead of Despres, leaving the Frenchman still eight minutes and 10 seconds ahead of Coma in the overall standings.

The pair are already well clear of their rivals, with third-placed Helder Rodrigues of Portugal, who finished fourth on the day, nearly 27 minutes adrift.

Coma, who is playing catch-up after losing 10 minutes on Tuesday when he took the wrong route, told reporters: "I tried to drive at a very high pace from the beginning, but it was difficult.

"I was able to overtake a few drivers and gain some time on Cyril and I will keep on fighting every day."

Meanwhile, nine-time overall winner Stephane Peterhansel took the lead in the car section after coming home first in Wednesday's stage.

The 46-year-old Mini driver finished five minutes and 19 seconds ahead of Argentinian Orlando Terranova in a Toyota, while South African Giniel De Villiers was third, also in a Toyota.

Peterhansel leads De Villiers by 5:41 in the overall standings, but defending champion Nasser Al-Attiyah of Qatar is now over 30 minutes behind in seventh place after his Hummer broke down.
