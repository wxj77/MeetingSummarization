London (CNN) -- When he was a 15-year-old schoolboy, Paul Wallace joined his father to see an exhibition of the world's most ostentatious automobiles. Wallace was entranced, and pulled out his camera to take photos.

The visit, taking in Aston Martins, Ferraris and Lamborghinis, would prove the beginnings of his lucrative YouTube video channel. "I sort of fell on my feet in that sense," the entrepreneur told CNN.

Wallace, still too young to get a driver's license, began filming supercars around London, and uploading them to YouTube.

The street shots and low resolution videos brought the cars "to life" for fans unable to afford one, Wallace said.

Now, the 23-year-old university graduate earns up to Â£4,000 ($6,722) a month from the advertisements displayed on his YouTube video channel, Supercars of London.

His account has had almost 70 million views, with hits coming from all over the world.

Wallace is now making a living from the site -- one of a number of YouTubers building a business out of the video platform.

Wallace has used his earnings to indulge his passion: buying his own supercar. The purchase of a Â£55,000 Audi R8 enabled Wallace to return his mom's Ford Focus, which had been on loan.

"I'm very much at the early stages of where I want to be, say, in five to 10 years time," Wallace told CNN.

And his supercar ambition remains unchanged. "A Lamborghini is what I aspire to," Wallace said, standing next to one in the supercar servicing garage in Watford, where he works.
