(Mashable)  -- Apple has unveiled Final Cut Pro X, the newest version of its popular video-editing software.

Final Cut Pro X is a rebuild of the 12-year-old software, according to Apple's Peter Steinauer and Randy Ubillos. It's the first 64-bit version for the software, capable of utilizing all eight cores and more than 4 GB of RAM of the Mac for professional video editing.

Apple revealed the new version of Final Cut Pro at an event at the National Association of Broadcasters trade show in Las Vegas.

Final Cut Pro X comes with a slew of new features, including advanced people and shot detection, automatic audio cleanup and "range-based keywording," which gives video editors the ability to apply keywords to specific portions of a video.

The new Final Cut Pro also sports a feature that prevents audio and video tracks from being pushed out of sync by accident. Photography Bay also reports that Final Cut Pro X will come with feature that automatically matches color between two clips.

Final Cut Pro X will be available for download via the Mac App Store in June for $299, far less than the Final Cut Studio's $999 price tag.
