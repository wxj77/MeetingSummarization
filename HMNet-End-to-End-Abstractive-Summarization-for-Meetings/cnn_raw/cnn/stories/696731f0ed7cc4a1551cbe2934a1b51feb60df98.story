(CNN) -- After several delays, NASA said Friday that space shuttle Discovery is scheduled for launch in five days.

The space shuttle Discovery, seen here in January, is now scheduled to launch Wednesday.

Commander Lee Archambault and his six crewmates are now scheduled to lift off to the International Space Station at 9:20 p.m. ET Wednesday.

NASA said its managers had completed a readiness review for Discovery, which will be making the 28th shuttle mission to the ISS.

The launch date had been delayed to allow "additional analysis and particle impact testing associated with a flow-control valve in the shuttle's main engines," the agency said.

According to NASA, the readiness review was initiated after damage was found in a valve on the shuttle Endeavour during its November 2008 flight. Three valves have been cleared and installed on Discovery, it said.

Discovery is to deliver the fourth and final set of "solar array wings" to the ISS. With the completed array the station will be able to provide enough electricity when the crew size is doubled to six in May, NASA said.

The Discovery also will carry a replacement for a failed unit in a system that converts urine to drinkable water, it said.

Discovery's 14-day mission will include four spacewalks, NASA said.
