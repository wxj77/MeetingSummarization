(CNN)  -- Championship leader Sebastian Vettel claimed pole position for Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix as he edged out McLaren's Lewis Hamilton in final qualifying at the Hungaroring.

Vettel, only fourth behind Hamilton in last weekend's German Grand Prix, re-asserted his season-long dominance with a time of one minute 19.815 seconds in his Red Bull in the last few moments of the session.

Hamilton's McLaren teammate and 2009 world champion Jenson Button was third fastest and will occupy the second row with Felipe Massa of Ferrari.

Massa, who suffered a near fatal crash in Hungary two years ago, outqualified his teammate and two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, who was fifth fastest.

Mark Webber in the second Red Bull will join Alonso on the third row.

Germans Nico Rosberg of Mercedes, Force India driver Adrian Sutil and Michael Schumacher in the second Mercedes were next best.

Sauber's young Mexican star Sergio Perez completed the top ten.

But this was all about defending champion Vettel, who was claiming the 23rd pole of his short but glittering F1 career and his eighth in 11 starts.

By his standards below-par performances at the British Grand Prix won by Alonso and at the Nurburgring last week, had left some question marks hanging over him, but he answered in fine style.

"We changed a lot on the car overnight. The boys were working pretty hard and the boys didn't get much sleep but a result like this today is the best way to say thanks," he told the post-race press conference.

"I have the confidence back and I am feeling comfortable in the car. I am looking forward to tomorrow."

With overtaking at a premium at the circuit in Budapest, Vettel will be favorite to extend his 77-point championship lead over Webber, with Hamilton five further points adrift.
