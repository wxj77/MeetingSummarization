(CNN) -- South Korean union and civic groups are gearing up for large protests against the G-20, which plans a summit in Seoul in November.

About four dozen union and civic groups have joined to oppose G-20 efforts, such as globalizing financial systems, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions has announced. Businesses have maximized profits while eroding workers' job security and labor rights, said the trade union, which aims to highlight such issues.

Collectively, the Group of 20 accounts for about 85 percent of global economic output. The 1997 Asian financial crisis prompted creation of the group, which aims to stabilize the world financial market.

The G-20 includes industrialized nations and developing economies, which focus on economic issues and economic policy coordination. The Group of Eight continues to focus on issues such as global security.

The G-20 held its last summit in June in Toronto, Canada.

Hundreds of protesters were arrested as violence and vandalism broke out. Cars were set on fire, windows were broken and graffiti was sprayed.

Some protesters were tear gassed, though no serious injuries were reported.
