(EW.com) -- Anyone wanting to get a glimpse of the abhorrent behavior in the "Big Brother" house this week needs to seek out fansites.

Wednesday's telecast made no mention of the racist and homophobic behavior that was uttered by several house guests on the 24/7 Internet feed.

The next episode of Big Brother airs on Sunday.
