(CNN) -- African football has been left reeling following the tragic deaths of two players in two days over the weekend, both while appearing for their clubs.

On Saturday, Nigerian striker Endurance Idahor collapsed on the pitch and died on his way to hospital while playing for Al Merreikh against Al Amal in a Sudanese league match.

The 25-year-old fell to the ground after a minor collision with a rival player and local media later reported that the player had suffered a heart attack.

Idahor finished as top scorer during his first season in Sudan and scored 118 goals in 176 appearances for Al Merreikh.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, teenage central defender Bartholomew Opoku collapsed while playing for Ghanaian side Kessben in their league clash with Liberty.

The 19-year-old was rushed to hospital but passed away on Monday, with the cause of death still unknown.

"It's a massive tragedy and the whole club is in shock. There was no hint he was unwell," the BBC Web site quoted Kessben spokesman Fred Acheampong.
