(CNN) -- South African President Jacob Zuma has been admitted to the hospital for tests, his spokesman Mac Maharaj said in a statement Saturday.

"Yesterday President Zuma was advised to rest following a demanding election and transition programme to the new administration," Maharaj said.

"Doctors are satisfied with his condition," the statement read.

Zuma was re-elected to a second term last month despite economic woes, deadly mining protests and corruption allegations.

His party, the African National Congress, won the general election with 62% of the vote, which was lower than the previous election.

After a turbulent first term, Zuma said during his inaugural address that his government will perform better this time around and take responsibility for any shortcomings.

"We will ... ensure much tighter accountability, with firm consequences where there is a failure to deliver services to our people," he promised.
