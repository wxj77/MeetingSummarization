(CNN Student News) -- August 30, 2013

As CNN Student News wraps up the week, we examine the U.S. and U.K. governments' debates concerning possible action against Syria. We also report on a fast food workers' strike and a settlement between the NFL and some former players. Plus, we delve into the Farmers' Almanac forecast for a frigid winter, and we find out how a helmet can also be a necklace.
