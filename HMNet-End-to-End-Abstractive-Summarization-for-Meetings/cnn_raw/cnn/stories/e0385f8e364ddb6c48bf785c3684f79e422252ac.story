(CNN) -- The body of a 25-year-old northern California man swept out to sea while trying to photograph the tsunami's arrival from Japan last month has washed ashore about 380 miles away, in Oregon, officials there said Tuesday.

Dustin Douglas Weber of Klamath, California, was standing on a sand bar near the mouth of the Klamath River in Del Norte County, California, when he was swept away March 11, authorities said.

Tsunami's first moments

He was with two friends who also were carried off by the surge but were able to return safely to shore, authorities said.

Weber was identified by a forensic odontologist using dental records, said Eugene Gray, forensic administrator in the Oregon state medical examiner's office.

Tsunami trash headed for U.S.

His body was found on the shore south of the Columbia River in Oregon on April 2 by a person walking the beach, Gray told CNN.
