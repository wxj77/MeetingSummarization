(CNN) -- A North Carolina resident was found guilty Thursday on terrorism charges including conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure people overseas.

Anes Subasic, a 35-year old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Bosnia, also was convicted of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. He will face up to life in prison at sentencing in August.

Subasic is the seventh member of a North Carolina group of men convicted of terror activities. They were led by Daniel Boyd, who pleaded guilty in February 2011 to conspiring to kill people abroad and to provide material support to terrorists. Boyd's sentencing was delayed so that he could testify against three other co-conspirators who were found guilty last fall.

Two of Boyd's sons also pleaded guilty and are in prison.

According to the government, from November 2006 until at least July 2009, Subasic and the others worked to provide money, weapons training, transportation and personnel to "advance violent jihad."

"Subasic was part of a group of terrorists; some viewed their own country as the enemy," said M. Chris Briese, who heads the FBI's Charlotte field office.

"Subasic was part of a conspiracy to commit violent acts against U.S. service members and others abroad," said John Khin, an official with the Defense Criminal Investigative Service.

In a separate trial last fall, Subasic was convicted on two counts of illegally obtaining citizenship.

An eighth man, Jude Kenan Mohammad, also was charged in the terror conspiracy. He has never been arrested and officials believe he is in Pakistan or may have died.
