(CNN)Myanmar warplanes fighting rebels dropped a bomb at a sugarcane field in China, killing four civilians, the latter's state media reported Saturday.

In addition to the fatalities, nine others were wounded, according to Xinhua news agency.

Shortly after the incident Friday, China sent fighter jets to patrol over their shared border.

The jets are there to "track, monitor, warn and chase away" Myanmar military planes, China's air force told state media.

China summoned Myanmar's ambassador in Beijing after the incident in the border city of Lincang.

Liu Zhenmin, the vice foreign minister for China, called on Myanmar to investigate and bring those behind the attack to justice.

Myanmar forces have been battling ethnic separatist rebels in the rugged border region across from Yunnan province.

In recent incidents, stray gunfire has damaged property on the Chinese side of the border, prompting Beijing to warn Myanmar to ensure safety.

There was no immediate reaction from Myanmar.
