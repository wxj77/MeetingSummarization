The checkered career of scandal-hit former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is set to take another turn, with the news Friday that he is to become an economic adviser to the Serbian government.

The appointment will be announced next week, an official in the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister's Office told CNN. She was not named in line with government policy.

"The exact details still have to be worked out, but we will have more information on Tuesday," the official said. "Mr. Strauss-Kahn will come to Serbia from time to time, but I don't think he will live here."

Asked why the government had chosen Strauss-Kahn, she said, "Because he is an expert in the field of economics."

The government declined to give out any more details ahead of Tuesday's announcement.

Strauss-Kahn, once considered a likely candidate for the French presidency, resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund in 2011 after being charged with sexually assaulting a New York City maid.

All sexual assault charges against him related to the maid were later dismissed at the request of a prosecutor.

More than a year later, in December 2012, Strauss-Kahn reached a settlement with the maid, the terms of which were not released. He told CNN's Richard Quest in an interview in July that he had opted to "pay and go on with my life," rather than spend more in legal fees fighting the civil case.

The 64-year-old told CNN he sometimes gives advice for free to less economically developed countries and had recently been working with the government of South Sudan.

In France, Strauss-Kahn is among a number of people charged with aggravated pimping in an investigation into sex parties at the Hotel Carlton, in the northern city of Lille. CNN affiliate BFM-TV said a trial was likely to be held next year.

Strauss-Kahn did not deny attending the parties, his lawyers said, but he said he did not know that the young women at the parties were being paid for sex.
