(CNN) -- Tom Hanks doesn't need to bring a present to a wedding. His dance moves are the gift that keeps on giving.

As caught on camera by Justin Bieber, Hanks was clearly one of the best parts of a star-filled wedding reception over the weekend, unabashedly grooving to Montell Jordan's 1995 hit, "This Is How We Do It."

Or, as Bieber put it on Instagram: "Tom Hanks singing 'This Is How we do it' dressed like a Rabbi lol #thatdancetho."

Bieber and Hanks, who turns 58 on Wednesday, were celebrating the nuptials of Bieber's manager, Scooter Braun.

Braun tied the knot with cancer prevention activist Yael Cohen in Canada on Sunday and picked his young talent to serenade the couple with the Beatles' "All You Need Is Love" during the ceremony.

According to TMZ, other attendees included a "No Diggity"-singing Ed Sheeran; Sophia Bush; Hanks' wife, Rita Wilson; and Carly Rae Jepsen, who at one point joined Bieber in a rendition of "Call Me Maybe."
