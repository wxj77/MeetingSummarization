London (CNN) -- Ezekiel Kemboi, who won the Olympic steeplechase, is under investigation on suspicion of having tried to stab a woman on a date back home in Kenya before the Games, police there said.

Kemboi, who took gold Sunday, was arrested and charged in Kenya a week before he came to London for the Olympics, deputy police spokesman Charles Owino said Monday.

The director of public prosecution has withdrawn the charges pending further investigation, Owino said.

The woman accused Kemboi of making sexual advances, the officer said, without naming the alleged victim.

Kemboi is a policeman himself, according to Owino.

Kemboi said that he was the victim of attempted extortion and that police had not given him a fair hearing, Owino said.

Kemboi did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
