(CNN) -- Roger Federer strengthened his grip on the top spot in the world rankings with a crushing 6-0 7-6 victory over Novak Djokovic Sunday in the final of the Cincinnati Masters 1000 tournament.

The Swiss maestro needed just 80 minutes to clinch his fifth title at the hard court tournament and claim the 1,000 ranking points on offer, against 600 for Djokovic, the world number two.

Federer took ruthless advantage of claiming three of his four break point opportunities to sweep through the opener without dropping a game.

The second set was closer, but Djokovic was unable to force a single break point on the Federer service as it went to a lengthy tiebreaker.

Djokovic held a set point at 7-6 but Federer saved it with bold play and swept the next two points to clinch a morale boosting victory ahead of the final grand slam of the season in the U.S. Open at Flushing Meadows.

The scoreline was similar to the last time the pair met in the Cincinnati final in 2009 when Federer won 6-1 7-5 and he has extended his career lead over the Serbian to 16-12.

Federer, who claimed the Wimbledon crown and took silver in the Olympic singles to Andy Murray, has charged back to number one and reached the Cincinnati final without dropping a set.

"I've had a magical summer. I feel good about New York -- but I'm going to savor this one for a bit." Federer said in his post-match interview.

Djokovic, who took the season opening grand slam in Australia, will be defending his U.S. Open title when it starts in New York on August 27.

Federer's victory in the final gives him his 21st Masters 1000 title, drawing level with Rafael Nadal of Spain, who is sidelined by a knee injury.

Defending Cincinnati champion Murray made a shock early exit to France's Jeremy Chardy.

China's Li Na later won the accompanying WTA tournament with a 1-6 6-3 6-1 victory over Anqelique Kerber of Germany in the final.

It was the ninth seed's first title since her French Open triumph 15 months ago.
