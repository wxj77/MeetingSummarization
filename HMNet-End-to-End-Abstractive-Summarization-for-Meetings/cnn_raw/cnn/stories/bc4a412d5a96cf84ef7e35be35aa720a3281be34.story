(CNN) -- The National Football League is investigating whether draft prospect Nick Kasa was questioned about his sexual orientation during a recent scouting combine, a spokesman said Wednesday.

"Any team or employee that inquires about impermissible subjects or makes an employment decision based on such factors is subject to league discipline," said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.

League policy states that teams "neither consider nor inquire about sexual orientation in the hiring process," Aiello said. "In addition, there are specific protections in our collective bargaining agreement with the players that prohibit discrimination against any player, including on the basis of sexual orientation."

Kasa, who played tight end at the University of Colorado, told CNN earlier Wednesday that during the combine, he was asked: "Do you have a girlfriend? Are you married? Do you like girls?"

"Those kind of things, and it was kind of weird," he told CNN. "But like they would ask you with a straight face, and it's a pretty weird experience altogether." Kasa did not say who asked him those questions.

NFL.com said that NFL teams "try to catch prospects off-guard when they interview them at the NFL Scouting Combine." The combine is a skills audition for NFL scouts and coaches before the draft, which this year will be held April 25 to 27.

Three years ago, however, the combine experienced controversy when Miami Dolphins General Manager Jeff Ireland asked Dez Bryant, now a Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, whether Bryant's mother was a prostitute. Ireland was "roundly criticized," NFL.com said.
