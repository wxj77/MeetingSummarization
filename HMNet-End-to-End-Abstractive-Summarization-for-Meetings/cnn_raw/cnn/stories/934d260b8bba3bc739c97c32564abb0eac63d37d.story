(CNN) -- Angelina Jolie "absolutely" plans to give up acting one day -- but not just yet.

The actress gave her fans a scare on Wednesday when she said in an interview with DuJour magazine that she's ready to give up performing for directing.

"I've never been comfortable as an actor; I've never loved being in front of the camera," Jolie said. "I didn't ever think I could direct, but I hope I'm able to have a career at it because I'm much happier."

So, she's planning to leave acting behind? "Absolutely," Jolie responded.

But that certainty came with a caveat.

"I see myself moving into directing more and doing much less as an actor," Jolie later clarified to Entertainment Weekly. "I have a few more in me, ones I have been developing for some time, so I will do those before I step away."

Obviously, one of those movies she wants to see through is her 2015 film "By the Sea," which she wrote and directed, and also stars in with husband Brad Pitt.

"It's a heavy film, and it's not easy for us," Jolie told DuJour of her upcoming project. "But even as you struggle through it, you're in the trenches together and you don't expect it to be easy. We're challenging each other and that's a really good thing."
