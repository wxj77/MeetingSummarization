(CNN) -- Lindsey Vonn suffered a mild strain to her right knee, a partial tear to her right ACL, and minor facial abrasions as a result of a recent fall, her spokesman said Wednesday.

The U.S. ski queen crashed Tuesday during a training run at Copper Mountain in Colorado.

"She needs to rest for a few days and then will pursue aggressive physical therapy and will determine the next time she is able to compete after seeing how she responds to the treatment," said Lewis Kay, her spokesman.

Vonn also suffered scapular contusions from the fall, he said.

In February, she was airlifted to a hospital after she landed heavily on the opening day of the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria. She tore the ACL and MCL in her right knee, and underwent surgery for knee reconstruction.

Vonn was crowned America's snow queen when she became the first American woman to win the Olympic downhill title at the Vancouver Games in 2010.

She followed up her Vancouver victory with a stellar World Cup season in 2011-2012, winning 12 races and the overall title with a new record points haul.

A combination of illness and injury disrupted Vonn's dominance on the slopes last season. She had planned to return at the World Cup event in Beaver Creek, Colorado on November 29.
