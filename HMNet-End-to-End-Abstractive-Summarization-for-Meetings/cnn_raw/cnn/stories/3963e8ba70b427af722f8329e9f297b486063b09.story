(CNN) -- "The Wire" actor Anwan Glover says that "my flesh may be stabbed but my spirit is unbreakable" after he was attacked early Sunday at a Washington nightclub.

Glover, who began his career as a musician, had finished performing at the club and was watching another group's show when the incident happened, he said in an Twitter posting Sunday.

The police report said Glover fell to the ground when he was struck in the head "by an unknown object" at Cafe Asia in northwest Washington and was "kicked in the body" by two unidentified attackers.

"While defending myself, I was stabbed," Glover said. "I was hospitalized and have been released."

The actor's publicist told CNN that the "attack was a complete shock to Anwan, as there was no incident or argument of any kind leading to it."

D.C. police said an investigation will continue, but no one has been arrested.

Glover was taken to a hospital, where he was treated and then released, police said.

"I am not a stranger to adversity and when shown hate, I'm going to spread love," Glover said. "I am recovering and will be back soon. My flesh may be stabbed but my spirit is unbreakable."

Glover is best known for his role as Slim Charles in the HBO crime drama "The Wire." He also played Cape in the 2013 Oscar-winning movie "12 Years a Slave."
