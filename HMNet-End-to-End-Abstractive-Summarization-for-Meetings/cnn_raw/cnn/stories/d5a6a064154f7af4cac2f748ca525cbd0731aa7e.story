(CNN Student News) -- January 17, 2014

On the last day of the school week, we're reporting on a presidential push concerning college attendance. We also remember the "miracle on the Hudson," and we discuss the driving force behind auto shows. And when a twin gives up her spot on the U.S. Olympic team so that her sister can go, we find a great Character Study.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.
