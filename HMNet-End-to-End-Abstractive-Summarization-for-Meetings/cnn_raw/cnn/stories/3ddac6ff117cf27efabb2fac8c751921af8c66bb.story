LONDON, England (CNN) -- It runs on 100 per cent renewable biodiesel and holds the record for the fastest circumnavigation of the globe in a powerboat -- and now Earthrace is for sale.

For sale: The green powerboat Earthrace is on the market for $1.5 million.

The boat's owner, New Zealander Pete Bethune, listed Earthrace as for sale on the vessel's dedicated Web site last year, and he's now taking it on a tour of Australia and New Zealand in the hope of finding a buyer.

Bethune is asking $1.5 million for the trimaran, which holds the world record for the fastest time in circling the globe in a powerboat.

Earthrace achieved the feat in 60 days, 23 hours and 49 minutes; beating the old record by over two weeks.

Earthrace claims to have a net zero carbon footprint by running on renewable bio diesel.

Most of the fuel is believed to come from waste animal fats. The 1080 hp engine is kept cool with ducts which expel hot air and suck in cold air.

Bethune has said he hopes to pay off some debts with the sale of the boat.
