(CNN) -- Actor or actuary? What is the best job in the world?

According to U.S. job site CareerCast, it's the latter. The company has ranked a list of 200 jobs to find the "best" based on four criteria: work environment, income, hiring outlook and stress levels.

Most of the statistics used to create the rankings came from U.S. government agencies.

Dominating the top 10 spots are health-care sector jobs, which are expected to grow as the American population ages.

On the other end of the spectrum, the lowest ranked job is newspaper reporter, reflecting the continuing decline of print media, followed by lumberjack, enlisted military personnel, actor and oil rig worker.

Would you rather compile statistics than tread the boards? What do you think constitutes the "best" job? Have your say in the comments, below.
