(CNN) -- Casey Anthony's defense team is now six attorneys strong.

At a news conference held outside Anthony's lead defense attorney's office in Kissimmee, Florida, on Tuesday, Jose Baez introduced three new members to its "dream team."

Baez and fellow defense attorney, Cheney Mason, said Dorothy Clay Sims and Ann Finnell will now represent Anthony at her criminal trial. Charles Green of Orlando will take over Anthony's civil case.

When asked by reporters how many lawyers are needed, Baez quickly responded that he would "rather be accused of being over prepared than under prepared."

"You can't buy this type of dream team," Mason said. "Well, Bill Gates can buy it."

Baez said building the team has been no easy task. In March, a Florida judge ruled Anthony was indigent, despite having been paid $200,000 for her personal photographs by ABC News.

"It takes a lot to ask a lawyer to sign on," Baez said. "Many times they believe in the cause and that has been the one driving factor ... [we] all believe in the cause for justice."

Mason, a prominent Orlando attorney, said another hurdle has been the location of the murder trial. He said Florida is "probably the toughest state to try criminal cases."

"We're up against the State Attorney's office," he said. "They have a law firm of 150 people."

Casey Anthony is charged with capital murder in the death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee. The girl was reported missing in July 2008, and investigators found her body after five months of intense searches and speculation.

Anthony's murder trial is set for May 2011.
