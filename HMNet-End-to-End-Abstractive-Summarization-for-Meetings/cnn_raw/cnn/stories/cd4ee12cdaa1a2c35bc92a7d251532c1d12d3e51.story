(CNN) -- Pitcher Derek Holland restricted St. Louis Cardinals to just two hits in eight and a third innings to help Texas Rangers record a 4-0 win Sunday night to level the World Series at 2-2.

The Cardinals had hit 16 runs in a comprehensive victory in game three on Saturday, with Dominican Albert Pujols smashing three home runs, but Holland was instrumental as the Rangers scored a shut-out success.

"Our pitcher was in complete control of the game," Rangers designated hitter Michael Young told Major League Baseball's (MLB) official website. "That was the story of the game.

"Every game in the postseason is huge -- every game is massive, and rightfully so -- but Derek pitched a great game tonight."

Young's view was echoed by the Cardinals' designated hitter, Lance Berkman, who conceded Holland had been the difference between the two teams.

"He was on," said Berkman, 35. "The story of the game, for me, is Derek Holland was better than the St. Louis Cardinals tonight. He just was. He was great."

The Rangers' manager Ron Washington was full of praise for the left-hander, saying the 25-year-old showed his game-winning quality.

"We needed him to go out there and pitch well and he did," Washington said. "He showed the world what he's capable of doing."

The Rangers' first run came at the bottom of the first, with Elvis Andrus running in from first base to score off the batting of Josh Hamilton.

The game's deciding moment came at the bottom of the sixth, when Mike Napoli went deep off pitcher Mitchell Boggs to score three for Texas and cement their winning lead.

The Rangers are searching for the first World Series triumph with Game Five in the best-of-seven series Monday night in Texas.

Game Six is at the Cardinals' Busch Stadium Wednesday.
