(CNN) -- Filippo Inzaghi rescued a point for AC Milan as they drew 1-1 against Catania at the San Siro, Saturday.

The goal was Inzaghi's 123rd for the club and puts him just one behind the club record of 124 held by Dutchman Marco van Basten.

Milan, who opened their 2010 Champions League campaign with a 2-0 win over French side Auxerre in midweek, failed to spark in a disappointing display.

Ciro Capuano gave Catania the lead in the 27th minute before Inzaghi equalized just before half time.

Fiorentina lost for the second weekend running, beaten 2-1 at home by Lazio.

Nineteen-year-old Adem Ljalic handed Fiorentina the lead when he scored from the penalty spot in the 19th minute.

But goals from Argentine Cristian Ledesma in the 32nd minute Czech international Libor Kozak scored the winner after 67 minutes sealed Fiorentina's fate.

The result leaves them languishing near the bottom of the table in 17th place.

Meanwhile in Spain's La Liga, Michael Laudrup enjoyed his first win in charge of Real Mallorca as they beat Osasuna 2-0 at home on Saturday.

Mallorca registered their first goal of the season with a Chori Castro penalty after 25 minutes, awarded for a handball by Osasuna's Miguel Flano.

The islanders made sure of the win deep into injury time with a goal from by Dutch midfielder Jonathan de Guzman.

The result moves Mallorca up to seventh in La Liga.

Elsewhere, Espanyol moved up to third place in the table after they defeated Almeria 1-0, courtesy of a Jose Callejon goal after 47 minutes.

Athletic Bilbao came from two goals down to draw with Sporting Gijon.

Gijon were two nil up within 25 minutes thanks to goals from Miguel de las Cuevas and Argentine Gaston Sangoy.

But Bilbao responded with goals from Carlos Gurpegui in the 29th minute followed by an equalizer on the hour mark from Spanish international Fernando Llorente.
