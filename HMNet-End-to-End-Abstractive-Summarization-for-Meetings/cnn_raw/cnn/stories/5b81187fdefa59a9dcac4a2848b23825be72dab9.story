PANAMA CITY, Panama (CNN) -- A helicopter crashed into a building in Panama City on Thursday, killing 11 of the 12 people aboard, including Chile's federal police chief, a Panamanian government official said.

The incident occurred during the afternoon in a commercial zone of the city as the Panamanian helicopter was carrying several Panamanian police officials and six members of a group from Chile. They had been attending a regional forum in the city of Colon, the official said.

Witnesses said a rotor blade hit a three-story building, causing the helicopter to fall in a ball of fire.

Several people on the ground were burned, and the building -- which houses a clothing store -- also caught fire.  Watch emergency workers at the scene Â»

It took firefighters hours to control the flames and to keep the blaze from spreading to other buildings.

"The principal problem is the smoke and the toxic gases; that's what makes the work more difficult," said Cecilio Lasso, one of the firefighters.

Chilean police chief Gen. Jose Alejandro Bernales and his wife were among the dead, the official said.

A delegation from Chile was expected to arrive late Thursday to help identify the bodies.

No cause was immediately identified for the crash.

"It's an old but well-maintained helicopter," said Daniel Delgado Diamante, minister of government and justice. "It was in good shape. Of course, now there will be a process of validating that."

The Chilean government has declared three days of mourning.
