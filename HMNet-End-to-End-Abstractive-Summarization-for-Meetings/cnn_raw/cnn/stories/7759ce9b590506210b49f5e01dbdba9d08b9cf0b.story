(CNN) -- Burglars broke into Amy Winehouse's London home early Thursday and took away several valuable guitars, recording equipment and a flat-screen TV, according to her spokesman.

Winehouse is currently vacationing in the Caribbean.

It was an easy mark for intruders who may have known Winehouse has been away for weeks on a Caribbean vacation, spokesman Chris Goodman said.

"It's one of life's little ironies," he said. "Usually, hundreds of paparazzi are outside her home."

When the Grammy-winning singer is in town, "it's the safest street in London," he said.

Winehouse, who is on the island of St. Lucia, is "writing music with another guitar that didn't get burgled," Goodman said.

"She's doing very well and is enjoying her time away," he said, but she is thinking about returning to London soon.

London police have already recovered some of the electronics taken from Winehouse's home, according to a Metropolitan Police spokeswoman.

A neighbor called police to the home after two men kicked in the front door at 4 a.m. Thursday, the spokeswoman said. No arrests have been made, she said.

The burglary wasn't the only bad news for Winehouse during her vacation.

Husband Blake Fielder-Civil earlier this month asked his lawyer "to commence divorce proceedings on the grounds of Amy's adultery," said his lawyer, Henri Brandman.

That came after Fielder-Civil saw photos of her cavorting with another man in the Caribbean while he sat in a British jail.
