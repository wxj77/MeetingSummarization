(CNN) -- "We have a very big responsibility to show the true meaning and the true essence of Islam." That's what it means to be Muslim today, according to Nashwa Zakharia, a PR director from the United Arab Emirates.

She says it has been "distorted" and "misrepresented" by world events and the actions of some individuals.

For Mohammed Abuhijlieh, an Assistant Project Manager in Abu Dhabi, Islam is about what it's always been about: "Being faithful, being honest, supporting the poor and feeding the needful."

During the current month of Ramadan, observing Muslims across the world fast from sunrise to sunset, pray more and spend time with loved ones. They celebrate their faith in many other ways too.

"I celebrate my faith by staying away from all sins, not hurting anyone," said Qais Salman, a civil engineer from Baghdad, Iraq.

For Irfan Majheed, an accountant from London, celebrating faith is all about family getting together "with food and music."

While some elements of being a Muslim may not have changed, some things are different since the turn of the millennium.

Malisha Choudhary, a housewife from London told CNN: "[Islam] is more exposed now, people are aware of the religion."

Emirati media specialist, Hazem Al Arraj agrees: "It has now, of course, changed for the best. In 1990, Islam was not really understood [by] other nations."

Yasin Tahir Najy, a TV technician from Baghdad, said Islam has not changed, but some people have.

"From its beginning until this moment, Islam is the same," he said. "What [has] changed are some Muslim characters, that [use] religion for their own interest.

"All those who impose their opinions -- in the name of Islam and religion -- on others," he said.
