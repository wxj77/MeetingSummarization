(EW.com) -- Three Thursday night dramas were greeted with larger audiences for their final episodes of the season, but one NBC comedy tied its all-time low.

ABC's "Grey's Anatomy" delivered 11.1 million viewers and a 3.9 rating, up 11 percent from last week and marking its best rating in three months. Check out EW.com's interview with "Grey's" showrunner Shonda Rhimes about last night's two shocking exits here.

Bigger news: Rhimes' "Scandal" (7.5 million, 2.4) was up too, and not just a little. The political soap was up 26 percent, which is expected to mark a series high for the show (even after its rating is adjusted later today to account for some "Grey's" overrun). "Scandal" started its brief midseason run modestly but, as we've noted before, seemed like it had the potential to grow.

CBS' "The Mentalist" (13 million, 2.5) was also up a tick for its latest Red John-focused finale (our interview with creator Bruno Heller about the finale here). Lead-in "Person of Interest" (13.3 million, 2.5), however, was down a notch for its finale.

All four dramas return this fall, though "The Mentalist" will shift to Sunday nights.

Now, about that triple-header "Community" finale. Why is NBC moving this comedy to Friday nights? Ratings like this. "Community" (2.5 million, 1.3), given a shot in the 9 p.m. hour, tied its series low across two episodes, as well as its 8 p.m. episode (3 million, 1.3). At 8:30 p.m., "30 Rock" (2.9 million, 1.3) didn't fare any better. At 10 p.m., "Awake" (2.1 million, 0.7) was down 22 percent from last week.

Fox's "American Idol" (15.8 million, 4.2) was up 8 percent. "Touch" (6.3 million, 1.8), however, didn't take advantage of its boosted lead in, and fell 5 percent (Fridays!).
