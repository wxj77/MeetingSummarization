(CNN) -- Schalke joined Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday after a 3-1 win over Stuttgart at the Veltins Arena.

Schalke's 20-year-old Cameroon midfielder Joel Matip opened the scoring in the third minute with further goals coming from Greek defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos in the 57th minute.

Eighteen-year-old midfielder Julian Draxler added a third ten minutes from time.

Japan striker Shinji Okazaki scored a consolation goal for Stuttgart near the end but it couldn't deny Schalke the win which lifts them level on points with Bayern.

Goals from Alexander Esswein and Dominic Maroh earned strugglers Nuremberg a valuable 2-0 win against Hertha Berlin.

Wolfsburg also claimed three much-needed points with a 1-0 win at home to Cologne courtesy of a goal from striker Sebastian Polter 12 minutes from time.

The clash at the bottom saw Freiburg beat Augsburg 1-0, meaning the clubs swap places at the foot of the table.

The game between fifth-place Werder Bremen and Kaiserslautern ended goalless as did the mid-table match between Hoffenheim and Hannover.

Sunday's fixtures see fourth-place Borussia Dortmund travel to Hamburg while sixth-place Bayer Leverkusen host Mainz.
