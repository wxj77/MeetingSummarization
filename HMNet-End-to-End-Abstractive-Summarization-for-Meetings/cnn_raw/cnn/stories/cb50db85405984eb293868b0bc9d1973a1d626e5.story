Los Angeles (CNN) -- A month after Nadya Suleman took her clothes off for an adult video, the octuplets mom has accepted a job dancing topless at a Florida strip club, her representative said Monday.

"This is not a new career for her," Gina Rodriguez told CNN. "She is just promoting her new video."

Suleman revealed in April that she was so determined to build a future for her 14 young children that she would accept adult entertainment offers, although she would not touch another "human's flesh."

"I wouldn't even kiss somebody for money," Suleman told HLN's "Showbiz Tonight" correspondent Nischelle Turner. "I would not kiss somebody. I wouldn't touch somebody."

Suleman, 36, will perform two shows a night for four days at T's Lounge in West Palm Beach, starting July 11, Rodriguez said. "She will appear topless at some point during her show."

How much Suleman -- known in tabloids as "Octomom" -- would be paid will stay secret, Rodriguez said.

The Orange County, California, home she bought after she gave birth to octuplets three years ago was recently placed in foreclosure, but the auction to sell it last month was postponed.

Suleman, who collects food stamps to feed her 14 young children, filed for bankruptcy last month, but the case was tossed out of court because of paperwork issues.

The adult video Suleman recorded last month is set for release in June, Rodriguez said.

Suleman dreams of building a business "empire" that will pay for food, shelter and college educations for her 14 children, she told Turner.

She ultimately hopes to become a role model for other women facing major struggles, she said.

"In the future, and I've got to win the battle," she said. "But right now, people don't understand that."
