(CNN) -- Too bad the Drinking Jacket won't be ready in time for this New Year's Eve.

A Kickstarter campaign looking to fund the apparel made for booze aficionados was only seeking $50,000, and has instead netted more than $450,000.

According to the Kickstarter page, the drinking jacket features a bottle opener zipper, both a hidden flask and neoprene koozie pockets, drinking mitts, and a sunglasses holder -- we presume to deal with the potential hangover (Advil not included). There is also a pocket specifically for the ID and money needed for a night of bar hopping.

The jacket is the brainchild of Zane Lamprey ,executive producer and host of "Chug," a fan-funded television show about, you guessed it, drinking. A pledge of $85 or more secures the Drinking Jacket, while those needing a tall size or a big and tall will have to ante up $90 and $95 respectively.

For the big spenders, a pledge of $1000 or more includes two jackets, two travel flasks and two tickets to both a dinner and a VIP party hosted by Lamprey.

The jacket is scheduled to ship in March 2015.
