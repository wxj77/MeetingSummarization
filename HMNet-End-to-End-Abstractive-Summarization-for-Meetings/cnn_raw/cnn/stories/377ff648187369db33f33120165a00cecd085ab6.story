(CNN) -- Golf superstar Tiger Woods said Wednesday that he wishes ex-wife Elin Nordegren "the best in everything" after their divorce, acknowledging that "My actions led us to this decision."

"I've made a lot of errors in my life, and that's something I'm going to have to live with," Woods said in Paramus, New Jersey, where he was practicing for The Barclays tournament, this weekend's first round of playoffs for the FedEx Cup.

Woods and Nordegren were officially divorced Monday, nine months after a Thanksgiving-weekend incident outside the couple's home in Florida. It set in motion the crash of the golfer's once tightly controlled image, ultimately leading to his admission that he had engaged in multiple extramarital affairs during his nearly six-year marriage.

"I wish her the best in everything. It was a sad time in our lives," he said. But he added they were looking at how they could help their two young children, Sam and Charlie, "the best we possibility can." Under their settlement, Woods and Nordegren will share custody of their children.

Woods was the youngest player to win all four of golf's major tournaments in 2000. But the 34-year-old has struggled since returning to the sport he has dominated for more than a decade. He said Wednesday that going through the divorce was "a lot more difficult than I was letting on."

Nordegren, meanwhile, has told People magazine that she was blindsided by the breakup. In an interview scheduled for publication this week, she said, "The word 'betrayal' isn't strong enough."

"I've been through hell," she said. "It's hard to think you have this life, and then all of a sudden -- was it a lie? You're struggling because it wasn't real. But I survived. It was hard, but it didn't kill me."

Nordegren told the magazine that she is working on a psychology degree and that the interview will be her last. People is owned by Time Warner, the parent company of CNN.
