(CNN) -- Cranberries star Dolores O'Riordan was arrested Monday after allegedly assaulting a member of airline staff on a transatlantic flight and headbutting a police officer who tried to arrest her, Irish police say.

O'Riordan, 43, was removed from the plane by officers at Shannon Airport in mid-West Ireland following the alleged incident on board an Aer Lingus flight from New York to Shannon Airport.

Police said the singer was later taken to a local hospital but later discharged and released from custody.

A spokesperson said "investigations are continuing."

The Irish singer had allegedly headbutted the garda (police officer) while she was being arrested, officers told CNN. The officer's injuries are "not serious" and he did not require hospital treatment.

The female cabin crew member was reportedly taken to hospital with a leg or foot injury, local police said.

Aer Lingus said in a statement: "An incident took place on board flight EI 110 en route from New York to Shannon today, Monday 10th November. The matter is being investigated by An Garda Siochana. As this is a security matter we will not comment any further."

The Cranberries rose to global fame in the mid-1990s with a string of hits, including "Linger," "Zombie" and "Dreams." The group, from Limerick, has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide.
