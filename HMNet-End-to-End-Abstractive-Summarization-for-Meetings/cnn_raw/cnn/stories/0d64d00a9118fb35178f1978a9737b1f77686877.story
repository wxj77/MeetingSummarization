(CNN) -- No doubt, this has been a trying time for Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.

First, health care workers at the facility sent a feverish Thomas Eric Duncan home the first time he came to the emergency room, even though he'd informed the nurse he'd recently been in Africa.

Then, after Duncan was admitted and diagnosed with Ebola, two of the nurses who were closely involved in his care contracted the deadly virus.

Earlier this month, Barclay Berden, the CEO of Texas Health Resources, said the hospital had "made mistakes" and "we are deeply sorry."
