(CNN) -- Just another big name for Zach Galifianakis and his comic Web series, "Between Two Ferns."

In March, the actor and comedian had on President Barack Obama. Thursday, the guest was Brad Pitt.

In classic "Between Two Ferns" style -- that is, the style of an early-'80s public access show -- Galifianakis made Pitt awkward from the beginning.

The "Fury" actor was introduced as "Bradley Pitts" (and ID'ed as "Bart Pit" from "12 Years a Salve") and immediately asked how old he was when he lost his virginity and why he doesn't shower.

Pitt accepted most of the insults with a blank good nature, even when Galifianakis called his new movie "Furry."

At one point, Galifianakis brought him a tightly wrapped gift that looked suspiciously like a bong.

"It's a bassoon," said Galifianakis.

"You know I'm a dad now," Pitt responded. "We don't 'bassoon' in my house anymore."

Published Wednesday to comedy site Funny or Die, the clip had 3 million views by late Thursday afternoon.

Things turned ugly when Galifianakis asked Pitt about the focus on his looks and how it distracts people from realizing "that you're just a sh***y actor."

Pitt's reaction was full of, um, spit and vinegar.

The actor did get a chance to put in a plug for Make It Right, his charity. But he was quickly interrupted by Galifianakis, who ushered comedian Louis C.K. onstage for a cameo standup routine.
