LONDON, England (CNN)      -- Up to 1,000 human rights campaigners demonstrated Saturday in front of No. 10 Downing Street, the official residence of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, calling on the British government to demand that full democracy be restored in Pakistan.

Jemima Khan, center, ex-wife for former Pakistani cricket star Imran Khan, joins protesters in London.

Protesters waved placards and chanted in support of the resignation of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, a week after he imposed a state of emergency in the country.

The crowd of demonstrators massed behind barriers and included Jemima Khan, the ex-wife of former Pakistani cricket star turned politician Imran Khan.

The demonstrators carried placards saying "Free the innocent" and "End Musharraf's Regime" and waved Pakistani flags.

Imran Khan, who heads the the Movement for Justice Party, has been under house arrest since the emergency declaration.

His ex-wife delivered a petition to a doorman at Downing Street, calling on Britain to use its influence to ensure that all institutions are in place well in advance of Pakistani elections originally scheduled for early next year. The petition also demands that Pakistan restore democracy and the judiciary and calls on Musharraf to release all political prisoners, including lawyers, journalists and opposition politicians.
