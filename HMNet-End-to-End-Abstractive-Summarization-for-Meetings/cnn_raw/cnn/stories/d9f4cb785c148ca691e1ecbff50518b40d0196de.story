LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Singer Natalie Cole underwent kidney transplant surgery at a Los Angeles, California, hospital Tuesday, according to a statement from her publicist.

Natalie Cole holds one of the Grammys she received in February for "Still Unforgettable."

Cole, daughter of legendary singer-actor Nat King Cole, has been receiving kidney dialysis three times a week since September, the statement said.

Cole was "resting comfortably" at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, it said.

"Ms. Cole's physicians have advised her to postpone her summer tour dates as she recuperates for the next three to four months," it said.

Rescheduled concert dates will be announced soon for Cole's tour, which is in support of her current double-Grammy-winning CD, "Still Unforgettable."
