(CNN) -- Formula One isn't due to touch down in New Jersey until the inaugural Grand Prix of America next year, but it didn't stop the Red Bull team from heading over early to unleash a car on some well-known landmarks.

The double constructors' champions let former Red Bull driver David Coulthard take the title-winning RB7 for a rip-roaring tear through the Lincoln Tunnel at speeds of up to 190 miles per hour, before heading over to Liberty State Park, with the famous statue looking on across the Hudson River.

In a bid to further endear the team to potential new fans stateside, Coulthard revved the engine to perform a Red Bull rendition of "The Star Spangled Banner."

It was Red Bull's second visit this year, after double world champion Sebastian Vettel tested out the New Jersey race circuit.

The U.S. is already on the this year's F1 calendar. Austin, Texas is to make its debut as a grand prix host in November, as the elite division of motorsport returns to the country for the first time since 2007.

The championship is in the middle of an annual midseason break, with Belgium the next stop on the sport's world tour on September 2.

Ferrari's Fernando Alonso heads the drivers' standings with 164 points, ahead of the Red Bull duo of Mark Webber in second and Vettel in third place.

McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, the last driver to win an F1 race in the U.S., is fourth ahead of 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen.

Red Bull, bidding for a third consecutive team crown, top the constructors' championship. The Austrian-owned marque are 53 points ahead of Ferrari in second with McLaren one point further back in third.
