(CNN) -- A mother and eight children were killed in a Kentucky house fire early Thursday, authorities said.

Two people -- the children's father, Chad J. Watson, 36, and an 11-year-old child -- survived. Both were taken via air ambulance to a hospital in Nashville, Tennessee and were listed in stable condition.

The mother was identified as 35-year-old LaRae Watson. The children who died ranged in age from 4 to 15.

Investigators have ruled the fire at a rural home in Greenville accidental, according to Kentucky State Police.

"It appears that an electric baseboard heater located in a bedroom ignited some nearby combustibles," they said in a statement.

The fire was reported at about 2 a.m. Thursday. Aerial video from CNN affiliate WTVF showed the house's charred exterior and blackened debris scattered around it.
