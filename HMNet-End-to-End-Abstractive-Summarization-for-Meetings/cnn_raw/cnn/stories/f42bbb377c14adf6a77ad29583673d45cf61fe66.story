(CNN) -- The death toll from last month's landslide in rural Washington state has risen to 33, the Snohomish County medical examiner's office said Monday.

That count is up from 30, which was the number given late last week. Twelve people are still missing, the county sheriff's office said.

A square mile of wet earth and rock rushed into the outskirts of the town of Oso in the North Cascade Mountains on March 22.

The slide came from a rain-saturated hillside along the north fork of the Stillaguamish River.

Bodies were found in the debris, which is 70 feet thick in some places and an average of 30 feet over the disaster zone.

Crews have been searching for people listed as missing.

Of the 33 recovered bodies, 30 have been identified. The medical examiner's office on Monday released the 30th name: Bill L. Spillers, 30, of Arlington.

CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.
