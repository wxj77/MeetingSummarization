Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- An FBI official has arrived in Aruba to assist with the investigation into the disappearance of a Maryland woman during a vacation there, an island official said Tuesday.

In addition, investigators plan to mount another search for 35-year-old Robyn Gardner in the coming days, Solicitor General Taco Stein told CNN. The efforts will be focused on the southern tip of the Dutch Caribbean island, Stein said, with police, firefighters and Dutch troops taking part.

FBI agents have already been involved in the case, searching the Gaithersburg, Maryland, home of the man now being held in connection with Gardner's disappearance. A judge in Aruba ordered Monday that the suspect, Gary Giordano, be held for another 16 days while police continue their investigation.

According to Aruban prosecutors, the missing woman and the suspect arrived on the island July 31 from the United States. She was last seen August 2 near Baby Beach, on the west side of the island.

Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office. He said Gardner was nowhere to be found when he reached the beach, according to prosecutors.

Giordano's lawyer, Michael Lopez, argued unsuccessfully Monday that there was not enough evidence to keep his client behind bars.

CNN's Tristan Smith and Martin Savidge contributed to this report.
