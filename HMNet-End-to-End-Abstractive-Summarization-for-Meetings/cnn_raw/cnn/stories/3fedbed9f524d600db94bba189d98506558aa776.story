Washington (CNN) -- Bernie Sanders is headed back to Iowa and New Hampshire for a handful of events that are sure to stoke more presidential speculation in the independent senator.

Sanders, according to his spokesman, will hold three events in the Hawkeye State this weekend, followed by one event in New Hampshire later in the week.

The Vermont senator will headline an Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement town hall meeting in Davenport, Iowa on Saturday.

On Sunday, Sanders will headline the Johnson County Democratic Party barbecue in Iowa City and keynote an Iowa Citizens Action Network meeting in Coralville.

Later in the week, on October 10, Sanders will hold a town hall meeting at the University of New Hampshire with, according to his office, "students and community members" from the university.

These events come less than a month after Sanders held a three-event tour of Iowa, where the senator spoke to audiences in Des Moines, Dubuque and Iowa City.

"We need a political revolution in this country," Sanders said in Dubuque. "Politics is terribly important, and what happens in Washington and state capitals is also enormously important."

Sanders has been open with the fact that he is considering a run at the presidency, but has not committed to the race and has been reluctant to openly take on Hillary Clinton, the prohibitive favorite for the Democrat's nomination in 2016.

In an interview with CNN last month, Sanders broke with that reluctance and challenged Clinton to talk about campaign finance reform, public funding of elections and other liberal issues.

"Now is Hillary Clinton going to say that," the senator asked after talking about his platform.
