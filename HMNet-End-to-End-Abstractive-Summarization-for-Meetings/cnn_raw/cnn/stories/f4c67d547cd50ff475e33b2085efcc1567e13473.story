(CNN) -- Dr. Rick Sacra, an American missionary doctor infected with the deadly Ebola virus, has improved slightly while being treated in Omaha, Nebraska, his wife said.

"Rick is very sick and weak, but slightly improved from when he arrived yesterday," Debbie Sacra said Saturday in a press release issued by SIM, the Christian mission organization for which Sacra works. "He asked for something to eat and had a little chicken soup."

Debbie Sacra and the couple's 22-year-old son visited him for 25 minutes by a video link at Nebraska Medical Center, according to the press release.

Sacra landed Friday morning in Omaha.

Sacra, the third American with Ebola to return to the United States for treatment, was stationed in Liberia when he was exposed to the virus.

Debbie Sacra said she and her husband want to keep the focus on the Ebola crisis in West Africa.

"We don't want this story to be about Rick," she said. "The story is the crisis in West Africa. That is what is most important. The world is coming to this fight late."

Ebola is a highly infectious disease that can kill up to 90 percent of the people who catch it. The CDC estimates there have been more than 3,000 cases of Ebola and more than 2,000 deaths since 1976.
