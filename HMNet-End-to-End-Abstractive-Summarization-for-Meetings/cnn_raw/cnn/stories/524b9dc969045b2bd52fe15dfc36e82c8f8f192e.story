Los Angeles (CNN) -- Superman and Batman fans will have to wait another two years before the two superheroes meet on the big screen.

Warner Bros. Pictures decided to delay the release of the so-far untitled movie until May 6, 2016, to give "filmmakers time to realize fully their vision, given the complex visual nature of the story," the studio said Friday.

The Zack Snyder-directed production had been scheduled for release on July 17, 2015.

"We know that there is already great anticipation building for the next super hero film from Zack Snyder, and we are equally eager to see what he has in store for Superman and Batman as they share the big screen for the first time ever," said Veronika Kwan Vandenberg, president of Warner Bros. Pictures' international distribution.

Henry Cavill will reprise his Superman/Clark Kent role, while Ben Affleck will step into the Batman/Bruce Wayne character. Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne and Diane Lane will also be in the film, with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince.

It may not be much consolation to those fans, but Warner Bros. also announced that a new Peter Pan adventure film will take the July 17, 2015, release slot vacated by Superman and Batman.

"Peter Pan has delighted people of every generation for more than a century, so we are thrilled to bring him back to the screen next summer for today's moviegoers," said Dan Fellman, president of Warner Bros. Pictures' domestic distribution.
