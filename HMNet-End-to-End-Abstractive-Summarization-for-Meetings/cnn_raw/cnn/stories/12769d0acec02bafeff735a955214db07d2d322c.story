Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor underwent surgery for the removal of a blood clot Friday night, a complication relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, her publicist said.

Gabor was rushed to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles after her husband called an ambulance to their Bel Air, California home, spokesman John Blanchette said.

Gabor, 93, is expected to remain in the hospital for several days, Blanchette said,

The actress had returned home on Wednesday, three weeks after undergoing surgery to replace a hip broken in a fall from her bed.

Gabor has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, said her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.

The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders.

Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, "Moulin Rouge," "The Story of Three Loves" in 1953, "The Girl in the Kremlin" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, "Touch of Evil."
