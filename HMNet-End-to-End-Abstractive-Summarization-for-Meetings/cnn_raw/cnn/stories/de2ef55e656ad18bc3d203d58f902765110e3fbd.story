(CNN)I know you are excited about the new Pee-wee Herman film, but what am I?

Netflix announced Tuesday that it will begin production next month on a new film starring the popular 1980s TV character, titled "Pee-wee's Big Holiday." No release date has been announced.

According to the Netflix news release, the on-demand movie will be produced by Paul Reubens, who plays the title character. Judd Apatow, of "Anchorman," "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" and "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" fame, will co-produce. John Lee, who has directed episodes of "Inside Amy Schumer" and "Broad City," will make his feature-film directorial debut.

It will be Herman's first feature film since 1988's"Big Top Pee-wee."

The 1985 feature film "Pee-wee's Big Adventure" became a cult classic, and from 1986 to 1990, television viewers tuned in to the absurd and infectious adventures of "Pee-wee's Playhouse."

Reubens retreated from show business for most of the 1990s, after he was arrested for indecent exposure at an adult movie theater in 1991. Despite some subsequent brushes with the law, Reubens and his alter ego have experienced a comeback in recent years, including a Broadway show and many television guest appearance spots.

"Judd and I dreamt up this movie four years ago. The world was much different back then -- Netflix was waiting by the mailbox for red envelopes to arrive. I've changed all that. The future is here. Get used to it. Bowtie is the new black," Reubens said in the statement.
