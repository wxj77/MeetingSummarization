(CNN)  -- Let the countdown begin. Not to stress you out (ok, maybe a little!) but you officially have eight days to finish your holiday shopping -- less time if you have to ship your gifts, and even less if you're reading this the day after it was published.

Ready for some help? So are we. We asked our holiday etiquette experts for their favorite piece of gift giving advice and they shared some great tidbits. But we're looking for more. Read their tips and then offer up yours in the comments below. We might just feature them in the article!

Jodi Newbern, author of "Regifting Revival: A Guide to Reusing Gifts Graciously"

There is no such thing as a bad regift. There are only bad regifters! Almost anything can become a meaningful and well-received gift if it is gifted -- or regifted -- appropriately.

Peggy Post, great-granddaughter-in-law of Emily Post

Get in the spirit of selecting the gift for somebody by trying to match it up with something they -- not you -- would enjoy. Don't overthink it!

Sherri Athay, author of "Present Perfect: Unforgettable Gifts for Every Occasion"

My brother once told me that he learned early in his marriage never to give his wife a gift with an electrical cord attached. Though there are exceptions to every rule, it's generally sound advice that I've shared with others over the years.

Anna Getty, author of "I'm Dreaming of a Green Christmas"

Enjoy the process and have fun. If it all turns into a hassle then what's the point?
