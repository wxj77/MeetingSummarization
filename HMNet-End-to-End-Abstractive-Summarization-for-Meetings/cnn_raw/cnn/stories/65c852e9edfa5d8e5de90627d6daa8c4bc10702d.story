Los Angeles (CNN) -- Ashton Kutcher teased Twitter followers Thursday night about reports that he'll join the "Two and a Half Men" cast to fill the gap left by Charlie Sheen's departure.

The actor tweeted this riddle to his 6,659,567 followers: "what's the square root of 6.25?" The answer is 2.5, as in "two and a half."

Kutcher's posting may the best clue amid silence from CBS, the network that airs the hit sitcom, and Warner Bros., the studio where the show is produced. They've both responded with "no comment" to CNN calls about a Kutcher contract.

Entertainment industry publications, including The Hollywood Reporter, are calling it a done deal, citing unidentified sources close to the negotiations.

Hugh Grant almost replaced Sheen on 'Men'

Kutcher, who gained his early fame on a TV sitcom -- "That '70s Show" -- has more recently been seen on the big screen. His last film was "No Strings Attached," which hit theaters in January.

He's also made his mark as a TV executive producer, most notably for MTV's hidden camera show "Punk'd."

While Kutcher gives fans a math quiz, the equation he's watching could involve his paycheck. Sheen, who is embroiled in a lawsuit over his sudden dismissal from the show, was earning a reported $2 million for each episode.

Producers have been scrambling in recent weeks to find a replacement for Sheen to keep one of TV's highest-rated sitcoms on the air for another year.
