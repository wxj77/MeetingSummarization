(CNN) -- A 27-year-old Tunisian man who set himself on fire to protest unemployment has died, officials said Wednesday.

Adel Khodri succumbed to his wounds early Wednesday morning, a day after he set himself ablaze, Tunisia's national civil protection and defense authorities said.

His fate parallels the iconic death of Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor who set himself on fire in December 2010.

Bouazizi's death was widely credited for spurring Arab Spring uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East.

The fruit vendor's fatal protest unleashed a wave of regional dissent against oppression, government corruption and stifled freedoms.

Self-immolation has since become more common in the Arab world, with people setting themselves on fire in Tunisia, Jordan, Bahrain and Morocco.

Although Tunisia has toppled a longtime ruler and held historic elections since Bouazizi's death, the country is still mired in  political unrest.

Khodri died the same day Tunisia's National Constituent Assembly is set to vote on a new government.

In a speech before Wednesday's vote, Prime Minster-designate Ali Larayedh explained a series of proposals for the new government, the country's official news agency TAP said.

Larayedh vowed to protect against excessive inflation, develop the economy, fight crime and boost development.
