British police want to question Robert Murat, a British man living in Portugal, in connection with the disappearance of Madeleine McCann at a Portuguese resort in 2007, a source close to the investigation told CNN.

Police also want to question Murat's wife and several others, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Madeleine was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family's holiday apartment on May 3, 2007.

Her parents had left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings asleep while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother raised the alarm when she checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing.

Portuguese police named Murat as an "arguido," or official suspect, some 10 days into the investigation.

Murat denied the allegations and insisted he was innocent. The suspect status was subsequently withdrawn and no charges were ever brought.

Murat received an apology and damages from several UK newspapers after reaching an out-of-court settlement with them over libel claims.

British police had been expected to travel to Portugal next week, but that trip was delayed for reasons unknown, the source said.

Murat's lawyer told CNN his client has not been informed of any British police request; Murat himself told ITV News he had been told of the development by Portuguese media.
