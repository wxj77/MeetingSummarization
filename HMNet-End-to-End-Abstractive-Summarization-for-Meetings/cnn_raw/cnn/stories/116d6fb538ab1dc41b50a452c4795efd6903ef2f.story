Feature films

From the award-winning producers of 2012's hit "Nairobi Half Life," comes a new crime thriller set around the khat -- a mild narcotic crop -- industry in Kenya. "Veve" sees popular actress Lizz Njagah take on the character of Esther, the lonely wife of a corrupt local politician who falls for the town's bad boy, Kenzo. Unbeknownst to her, Kenzo is at the heart of a scheme to bring about the downfall of Esther's Khat kingpin spouse.

Difret -- dir. Zeresenay Berhane Mehari, Ethiopia, 2013

A film from Zeresenay Berhane Mehari and executive producer Angelina Jolie, the 99-minute feature is based on a true story which deftly examines the issues faced today by women and girls in rural Ethiopia. Protagonist Hirut is a teenager kidnapped as she makes her way home from school. Tension mounts as she faces the increasing prospect of rape by her male kidnappers. Luckily, the astute young woman manages to steal a rifle and escape, but not before killing one of her would-be rapists. As local justice falls on the side of the male perpetrators, only one person, the head of a local not-for-profit, fights to save the young teen's life.

The Two of Us -- dir. Ernest Nkosi, South Africa, 2014

South African film "The Two of Us" makes its world premiere at this year's DIFF. First-time filmmaker Ernest Nkosi tells the story of a tempestuous sibling relationship between Thulas and Zanele and their lives in the Alexandra township. Burdened by a childhood of observing his sister's abuse, Thulas develops an overprotective need to help his sister which comes to a head when Zanele falls in love with an older man. Themes accessible to an international audience but with a distinctly local flavor, it is a strong directorial debute from Nkosi.

Grappling with intense loneliness, the young girl withdraws into an imaginary world making friends with "Bersie."
