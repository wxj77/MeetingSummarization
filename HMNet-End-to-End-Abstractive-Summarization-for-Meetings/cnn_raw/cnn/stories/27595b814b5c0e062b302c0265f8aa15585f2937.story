(EW.com ) -- Another "Harry Potter" star is coming to Broadway.

Rupert Grint, best known for playing Ron Weasley in the blockbuster "Harry Potter" film franchise, will make his Broadway debut this fall in Terrence McNally's starry comedy It's Only a Play.

Grint joins an A-list cast that includes Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, Stockard Channing, Megan Mullally, F. Murrary Abraham and newcomer Micah Stock. Jack O'Brien will direct the limited 17-week engagement, which opens at Broadway's Schoenfeld Theatre on October 9.

The British star will play Frank Finger, the wunderkind director of a new play by an anxious writer (Broderick) whose career is on the line as he eagerly awaits the reviews on opening night. As the show roars onward, the playwright passes the time with his TV star best friend (Lane), his producer (Mullally), the show's leading lady (Channing), an infamous critic (Abraham), and a fresh-faced coat check attendant (Stock). The play first premiered in New York in 1986 at the Manhattan Theatre Club; the 2014 production is a newly revised adaptation by McNally, the four-time Tony-winning scribe whose recent premiere Mothers and Sons marked his 50th year on Broadway.

On the theater acting front, Grint followed up the smashing success of the "Potter" films with his West End stage debut in the revival of Jez Butterworth's Mojo (alongside Skyfall's Ben Whishaw and Downton Abbey's Brendan Coyle).

Grint's "Potter" co-star Daniel Radcliffe recently returned to Broadway in The Cripple of Inishmaan, but their stints on the New York stage won't overlap (Radcliffe's engagement ends this July).
