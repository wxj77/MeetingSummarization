(CNN) -- All passengers aboard a passenger train that fell into a river in southwest China's Sichuan ProvinceThursday got out alive, state-run CCTV reported Friday.

The accident occurred in Guanghan at about 3:20 p.m. Thursday on the Shi-ting-jiang Bridge, part of the railway line that links Chengdu and Baoji, in northwestern Shaanxi Province.

Floods caused the bridge piers to collapse, which forced the train from its track, local officials said. It was not immediately known how many passengers were inside the carriages, which a firefighter said were swept 200 meters downriver.

Hundreds of people aboard five other carriages were taken to safety.

The train was traveling from Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi, to Kunming, the capital of southwestern Yunnan Province.
