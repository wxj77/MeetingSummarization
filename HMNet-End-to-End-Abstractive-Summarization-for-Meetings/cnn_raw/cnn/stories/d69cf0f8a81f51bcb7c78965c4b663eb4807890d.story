(CNN) -- Severe flooding in the Pacific island nation of Fiji has killed four people and left 800 people seeking shelter in evacuation centers, a government official said Monday.

Tropical Cyclone Daphne has lashed Fiji's largest and most populous island, Viti Levu, with strong winds and heavy rain.

The Fiji Meteorological Service said Monday that it was maintaining its severe flood warning for "all major rivers, streams and low lying areas" on the island.

Sharon Smith Johns, the Fiji government's information secretary, said she was touring the affected areas with the prime minister, Voreqe Bainimarama. She said some people had started to try to move back to their homes.

The extreme weather has disrupted both internal and external travel. Authorities on Sunday suspended inbound flights to Nadi International Airport because nearby roads were flooded. The suspension was lifted Monday but remained subject to review.

The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised its country's citizens planning to fly into the airport "to reconsider their need to travel."
