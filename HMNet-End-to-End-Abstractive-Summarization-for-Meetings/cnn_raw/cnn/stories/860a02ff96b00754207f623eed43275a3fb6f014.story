A body found along a river in suburban Seattle is that of "August: Osage County" actress Misty Upham, a Washington coroner said late Friday.

The cause of her death is still under investigation, the King County Medical Examiner's Office said.

According to the medical examiner's office, the 32-year old actress died October 5.

A member of Upham's family found her body during a search for the actress, according to police in Auburn, Washington. It lay at the bottom of a steep embankment near the White River.

Even before her body was identified, a purse containing Upham's ID had been found with the remains, police said.

Upham, 32, was last seen October 5 walking from her sister's apartment in Muckleshoot, Washington, according to a statement sent to media outlets by her father, Charles Upham. She was reported missing the following day.

Her father said she had bipolar disorder and bouts of depression and anxiety, but he didn't think she was suicidal.

"The truth is Misty is not stressed over money or career. Her career is going great," he wrote Sunday. "As her father I do not fear she committed suicide. I feel that she has been hurt by accident or someone has put her in harm's way."

Upham had small roles in "Django Unchained" and "August: Osage County," and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for her performance in 2008's "Frozen River." She's also had roles in the TV series "Big Love" and the TV movie "Skinwalkers."

She was currently shooting a film called "Crawlspace," according to the Internet Movie Database.
