(CNN) -- While millions of Americans were at home celebrating Thanksgiving Day, Lindsey Vonn was out on the slopes early doing what she loves most.

The champion skier raised hopes she will soon be fit to return to action after testing her re-injured knee Thursday at her home piste in Vail, Colorado.

"First day back on snow since my crash and it was awesome!" Vonn wrote on her Facebook page.

"I'm very thankful for many things this year (family, loved ones, great fans) but at this moment I'm happy to be on the mountain doing what I love -- skiing!! Happy thanksgiving everyone!"

Vonn, who revealed that the resort staff opened the lifts early for her, has yet to make a World Cup appearance this season.

She decided to skip the opening events in Austria and Finland, while last week's training crash has ruled her out of this weekend's three races at Beaver Creek, Colorado.

The 29-year-old is recovering from new damage to the knee ligament that required major surgery after an accident on the opening day of the world championships in February.

However, U.S. ski team women's head physician Bill Sterett said Vonn's first session since her tumble nine days ago went fine and there were "no issues."

Next February Vonn is hoping to defend her downhill title at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, while she is also just four race wins away from a new World Cup record.

The next opportunity for Vonn -- who made her relationship with golf star Tiger Woods public in March -- is likely to be at the Canadian resort Lake Louise next weekend.
