An attack by suspected ISIS militants on a border guard base near the Syrian border left at least 16  killed and four others seriously wounded according to Faleh al-Issawi, the deputy head of the Anbar provincial council in Iraq.

The militants slaughtered the 16 border guards, including their commanding officer, in a surprise early morning attack on Monday, al-Issawi said.

Four others are in critical condition, he said.

The base attacked is near al-Waleed border crossing, the only crossing Iraq has with Syria that is still controlled by Iraqi forces. ISIS maintains control of almost all of Anbar -- Iraq's largest province.
