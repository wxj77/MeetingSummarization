(CNN) -- Andrea Pirlo has ended speculation that he will join Chelsea by announcing that he has been taken off the transfer market by AC Milan and hopes to stay with the Serie A side for the rest of his career.

Andrea Pirlo hopes to help AC Milan overcome the loss of Paolo Maldini and Kaka this season.

The Italy midfielder has been linked with a move to the big-spending English Premier League club since coach Carlo Ancelotti quit Milan at the end of May and agreed to take over from Guus Hiddink at Stamford Bridge.

The 30-year-old revealed on the Milan Web site that new team boss Leonardo was happy to keep him at the San Siro.

"Today is a great day, I'm very happy to be able to end my career here," Pirlo said on Thursday.

"This is thanks to president Silvio Berlusconi, Adriano Galliani and Leonardo who have given me the possibility to end my career here by taking me off the market.

"When they communicated this news to me, we were all happy. Finally this story ends and I can continue my adventure with the Rossoneri.

"There was a possibility of changing teams, but in the end the club and I agreed to continue together and we're all happier. It was an eventful summer with many doubts, but in the end my family are happy to stay in Milan."

Pirlo, who joined Milan from city rivals Inter in 2001, said that as a senior player he felt responsibility for maintaining the club's momentum following the retirement of legendary defender Paolo Maldini and the sale of star player Kaka to Real Madrid.

"Milan's history must continue to be winning. Us older players must take more responsibility and give everyone great satisfactions. The President has talked to us and he wants the story to continue, so we restart with great enthusiasm," he said.

"Leonardo is a very good person and he will show in time he is a great coach thanks to everyone's help because he deserves it and we will certainly reap the benefits."
