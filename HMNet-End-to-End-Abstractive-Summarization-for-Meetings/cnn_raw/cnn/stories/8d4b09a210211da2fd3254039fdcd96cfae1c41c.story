(EW.com) -- The "CSI" team is going to the Big Apple.

CBS is planning "CSI" and "CSI: NY" cross-over episodes for February sweeps.

Across two hours, Detective Mac Taylor (Gary Sinise) will visit the "CSI" team in Las Vegas, while D.B. Russell (Ted Danson) will head to New York City.

"CSI" will kick things off on Wednesday, Feb. 6, with Taylor arriving in Las Vegas to surprise his girlfriend but learns she is missing. With her hotel room now a crime scene, he joins forces with Russell and his Vegas team in an effort to find her.

The action continues on Friday, Feb. 8 on "CSI: NY," where, according to the network, "the search for Mac's girlfriend continues as Russell heads to New York to help Taylor, but even after apprehending one of the men responsible for Christine's kidnapping, they still need to determine the motive and whether she is still alive. The case gets personal for Taylor as he wrestles with breaking police protocol in an effort to find the kidnappers."

The strategy is the latest in a series of CBS crossovers, such as last season's "NCIS: LA" crossover with "Hawaii Five-0." Previously CSI had a crossover where then-star Laurence Fishburne appeared on all three of the franchise's shows.
