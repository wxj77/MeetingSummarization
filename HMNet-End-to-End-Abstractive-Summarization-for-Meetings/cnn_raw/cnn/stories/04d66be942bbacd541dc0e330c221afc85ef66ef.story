(CNN) -- Mila Kunis is living the dream.

The actress has a thriving career and baby on the way with fiance Ashton Kutcher. But according to a recent interview with W Magazine, it's even more of a fairy tale, as Kutcher was her first kiss.

"My first real kiss ever was with him on the show," Kunis said of "That '70s Show," the 1998-2006 series in which the pair co-starred.

Calling Kutcher the "love of my life," Kunis shared how they shared in a tradition of many high school couples -- even if, for them, it was make-believe.

"And when That '70s Show had a prom, my date for the prom turned out to be my fiance," she said. "We can honestly say that we went to prom together! I do think that in that episode I went home with someone else. We don't talk about that part."

It appears that Kunis can totally relate to those of us who once fantasized about that dreamy celeb, though she actually snagged her star.

"We all get movie star crushes," she said. "I'm marrying mine."
