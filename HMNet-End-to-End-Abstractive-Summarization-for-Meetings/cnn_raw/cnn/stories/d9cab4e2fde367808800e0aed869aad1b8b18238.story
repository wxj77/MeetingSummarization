(CNN) -- While the nation followed the election numbers for Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, some readers were keeping track of a particular issue: marijuana legalization. Referendums passed in Washington and Colorado, but not in Oregon.

There are still federal hurdles to overcome for the two states where the referendums passed, and plenty of debate is sure to arise in the next few weeks. But some of our readers are hailing the legalization votes as a milestone comparable to ending Prohibition, or suggesting this could be a big boon for state economies. Still other readers are worried about the consequences of legalizing pot or the ways in which laws will be enforced.

Check out what some readers had to say both in story comments and with social media posts.
