(CNN) -- The rivalry is so intense that Barnes & Noble actually spoke its competitor's name:

"Kindle Fire is deficient for a media tablet," Barnes & Noble CEO William Lynch said as he unveiled his company's Nook Tablet on Monday. "Content will render better on Nook than on Kindle Fire."

That jab essentially re-opened the fight between Barnes & Noble and Amazon over customers looking for digital-book-reading devices. Round I in this donnybrook was between the Nook and Kindle e-readers.

Next week, however, both companies will put their next-generation tablets on the market, setting up a new battle for holiday shoppers looking for gadgets that are good for reading books, watching videos and browsing the Internet.

Here's a quick comparison of the devices, which are called the Nook Tablet and Kindle Fire. (The gist, in case you're in a hurry, is that they're pretty darn similar; the Kindle costs $50 less, while the Nook has twice the storage space and a longer advertised battery life).
