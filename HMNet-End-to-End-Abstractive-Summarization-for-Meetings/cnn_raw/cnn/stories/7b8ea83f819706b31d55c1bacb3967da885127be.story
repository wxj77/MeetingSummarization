(EW.com) -- First thing's first: TLC's new ratings release for "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" is now calling the Thompson clan "America's favorite family." Did we all agree to this? Was there a vote I missed?

The reality show is getting more popular, however. The Georgia pageant brood's third week premiere on Wednesday night delivered 2.3 million viewers, a season high.

The plot: Six-year-old Alana was forced to part ways with her beloved pet pig, Glitzy. Yes, that was the story!

Meanwhile,Thursday night's broadcast ratings were dull. Do you want to know that CBS' "Big Brother" had 6.4 million viewers and a 2.2 in the adult demo, the same as last week?

Is fall here yet?
