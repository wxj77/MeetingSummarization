(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund began the defense of their Bundesliga title with a 2-1 win over Werder Bremen at the Westfalenstadion on Friday.

New signing Marco Reus opened his account for the reigning champions with a sweet strike in the 11th minute to send Jurgen Klopp's men a goal up at the break.

"I think the opening goal was really important for the team," said Reus, who joined from Moenchengladbach in the summer.

"I had goosebumps when I ran out and I am happy that I am now a Dortmund player," he added.

Efforts to put the game beyond the reach of the visitors in the second half were initially repelled as Bremen goalkeeper Sebastian Mielitz palmed defender Mats Hummels' header over the bar.

Other chances came and went before Bremen drew level with a headed effort of their own from defender Gebre Selassie -- who arrived from Czech champions Slovan Liberec in June -- in the 75th minute.

But the home side were not to be denied as Germany international Mario Goetze came off the bench to score the winner six minutes later.

The win extends Dortmund's incredible undefeated run in the league to 29 matches and they are now only seven games short of the Bundesliga record set by Hamburg in the 1982-83 season.

The team's last league defeat -- a 2-1 defeat at Hanover -- came on September 18th last year.

Bayern Munich's quest for a 23rd league title begins at newly-promoted Greuther Fuerth on Saturday, while last season's third-placed team, Schalke start their season on Sunday with a trip to Hanover.
