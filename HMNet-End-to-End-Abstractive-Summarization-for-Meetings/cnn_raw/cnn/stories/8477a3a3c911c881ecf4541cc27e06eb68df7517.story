(CNN)Drew Peterson, the imprisoned former Chicago-area police sergeant found guilty of murdering his ex-wife, was charged Monday on two counts of murder solicitation.

Between September 2013 and December 2014, Peterson allegedly hired someone to try to kill Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow, the prosecutor who won a conviction in 2012 that sent Peterson away for 38 years, according to the Illinois Attorney General's Office.

It was unclear from court documents whether the alleged murder solicitation resulted in any attempt on Glasgow's life. Glasgow remains the state's attorney in Will County.

In a statement, he said that he has "absolute faith in law enforcement and our criminal justice system to handle this case appropriately."

"It is unfortunate that prosecutors sometimes must deal with allegations of this nature. However, in no way will a threat to my personal safety deter me from the important work I perform as the State's Attorney on behalf of the citizens of Will County," said Glasgow.

Peterson is imprisoned at Menard Correctional Center in Illinois' Randolph County.

He made an initial appearance at the Randolph County Courthouse on Monday on one count of solicitation of murder for hire and one count of solicitation of murder.

A call for comment to Peterson's attorney was not immediately returned.

A preliminary hearing is set for March 3 at 10 a.m. local time, the attorney general's office said. The case will be jointly prosecuted by that office and the Randolph County state's attorney's office.
