(CNN) -- Food and water were being dropped by helicopters on Monday to residents in rural Indonesia cut off after a 6.6 magnitude earthquake struck, triggering landslides, according to the National Disaster Management Agency.

At least 6 people were killed and 43 wounded when the earthquake struck Sunday near the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of the National Disaster Agency said.

About 471 homes and buildings have been destroyed, Nugroho said. Many of those displaced are staying in shelters or government buildings that were undamaged by the quake.

Rescuers have been unable to reach several village because landslides triggered by the quake are blocking the roads. Heavy equipment and bulldozers are helping clear the way.

Disaster, health and social welfare officials, including the Red Cross, are headed to the area to provide emergency assistance, trucks and ambulances.

Indonesia is on the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
