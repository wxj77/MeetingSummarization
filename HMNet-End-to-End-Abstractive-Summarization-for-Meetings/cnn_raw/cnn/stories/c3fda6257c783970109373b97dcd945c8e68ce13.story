Seven-time grand slam winner Venus Williams has pulled out of the forthcoming Rogers Cup tournament in Toronto with a viral illness.

The American was due to face Serb Ana Ivanovic in a first round clash on Tuesday, but will now be replaced in the draw by Chinese qualifier Zhang Shuai.

The extra berth created by the 31-year-old Williams' withdrawal has been given to Spain's Lourdes Dominguez Lino.

"I was really excited to play Toronto," world number 34 Williams told the tournament's official web site.

"I came here ready to go and was practicing. I wasn't feeling very well and had to see the doctor today. I was diagnosed with a viral illness and unfortunately am unable to play. I am extremely disappointed. I'm very sorry to the fans and tournament."

Williams has struggled with injury in recent years and has not played competitively since Wimbledon in June and July.

Her last WTA Tour title came at the Dubai Tennis Championships in February 2010.

Despite Williams pulling out of the event, the Rexall Centre tournament still boasts a top-level field including world number one Caroline Wozniacki, the number two ranked Kim Clijsters and Venus' sister Serena.

Elsewhere, Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska upset the odds to beat top seed Vera Zvonareva in the final of the WTA tournament in Carlsbad, California.

Radwanska, a beaten finalist at the same event in 2010, scored a 6-3 6-4 win to defeat world number three Zvonareva for the first time in her career and land her fifth WTA Tour title.

"I really wanted to win this tournament," the world number 12 told the WTA's web site.

"So I was really focused from the beginning. Winning a tournament with a lot of great matches against top players is very special.

"Last year I came pretty close, and even if I lost today, I would have been happy to be in the final again. But to take the title is better, of course - I had that in the back of my mind."
