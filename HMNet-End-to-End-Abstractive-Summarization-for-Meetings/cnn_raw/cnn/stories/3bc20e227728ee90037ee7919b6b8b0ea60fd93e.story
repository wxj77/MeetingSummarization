Today on CNN Student News, we report on an important vote facing Congress, with different messages circulating around the U.S. We also step inside a Syrian refugee camp to get a sense of the challenges facing the displaced. And we explain how Tokyo won the opportunity to host the Olympics for the first time since 1964.
