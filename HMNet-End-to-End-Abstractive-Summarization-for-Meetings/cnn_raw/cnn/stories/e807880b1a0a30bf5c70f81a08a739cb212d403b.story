(CNN) -- Colombian rebels say they are ready to start the unilateral release of five hostages, according to a message posted Wednesday on a former Colombian senator's website.

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, said in the message that "we hope to disseminate security protocols that surround the operation to unleash the dynamics of the releases."

The message was posted on the website of former Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba, who has a history of negotiating the release of FARC hostages.

The FARC message, dated Monday, said that the Colombian army has intensified its preparations for the release.

In December, the FARC announced its plans to release the five hostages -- a police major, two military service members and two municipal politicians -- as a humanitarian gesture.

In the December statement, the FARC criticized Colombia's attorney general for removing and disqualifying Cordoba from serving in the legislature.

The attorney general cited her close ties to the group as the basis for her removal from the Senate.

The hostages to be freed were identified in December as police Maj. Guillermo Solorzano, Army Cpl. Salin Sanmiguel, Marine Henry Lopez Martinez, and mayors Marcos Vaquero and Armando Acuna.
