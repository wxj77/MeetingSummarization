(CNN) -- Former "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and wife Kayte Walsh Grammer are expecting twins, the actor said Sunday.

He made the announcement backstage at the Golden Globes after winning the award for best actor in a TV drama series for his roll in "Boss."

"I'm really looking forward to meeting these new arrivals in our lives, I really am," he said.

Grammer, 56, married the 32-year-old former flight attendant in February in New York, just after Grammer's divorce became final from his third wife, Camille Donatacci, who appears on "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."

He predicted Sunday that Kayte will be an "extraordinary" mother.

"She's one of the most loving, amazing, warm human beings I've ever met," he said.

Grammer currently portrays Chicago Mayor Tom Kane in the Starz series "Boss." He closed his Globes acceptance speech by thanking his wife "for the future and what a magnificent year it's been."

Grammer and Donatacci had two children -- Jude, now 7, and Mason, 10. Grammer also has daughters Spencer, 28, and Greer, 19, from previous relationships.

He told CNN's Piers Morgan in October that "I think (Donatacci) married me because I was Frasier."

Grammer also told the CNN host that his "parting gift" to his third wife was her role in the reality series "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."

"Whether or not it worked well for her doesn't matter," Grammer said. "It was my way of saying, 'Look, you always wanted to be famous. Here you go.' "
