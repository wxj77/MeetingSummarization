(CNN) -- A Portugal player embarrassed himself Monday with his crazy decision to use his head the wrong way and he got panned for the way he lashed out at an opponent.

That, and Portugal's play in a humbling 4-0 loss, were two of the lowlights on the fifth day of play in Brazil. As was a 0-0 draw that produced very little excitement.

But then there was the stunning goal by a U.S. player whose inclusion in the game was a surprise to many.

Here are a few of the day's big developments.

That's not nice

Pepe, Pepe, Pepe. Bad boy!

It is generally frowned upon to headbutt anyone, anytime -- unless it's Wrestlemania!

But if you're gonna do it -- and again, shame on you for thinking about it -- at least do it right.

That's not us, that Twitterazzi, who slammed the Portuguese player after he tapped German forward Thomas Muller in Monday's match with the crown of his head.

"The only man that can pull of a headbutt with class is Zinedine Zidane," wrote @YusufBambi, referring to the memorable 2006 World Cup incident in which the French great slammed his head into the chest of an Italian player.

"I'll rate that headbutt 1 #Zidane out of 5 #NeverGoFullPepe #WorldCup2014," said @MrNewports.

"Calling that a head-butt by Pepe is an insult to Zizou..... and (boxer Evander) Holyfield," wrote â€
