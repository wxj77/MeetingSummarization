(CNN) -- Freddie Prinze Jr. and Kiefer Sutherland have very different memories of working together on "24."

The two actors co-starred on the Fox series in 2010, and according to Prinze the experience was so bad it left him wanting to change careers.

"It was terrible," Prinze told ABC News of his stint on "24." "I hated every moment of it. ... I just wanted to quit the business after that. So I just sort of stopped."

Prinze didn't leave acting -- he was at San Diego Comic-Con over the weekend promoting his Disney XD series "Star Wars Rebels," and has worked on TV series "Bones" and "Witches of East End" within the past year. But according to Prinze, it was Sutherland in particular who made him want to throw in the towel.

"Kiefer was the most unprofessional dude in the world," Prinze said of the "24" star. "That's not me talking trash, I'd say it to his face. I think everyone that's worked with him has said that."

Well, it doesn't seem that way. In a statement to ABC News, Sutherland's rep said that Sutherland didn't know Prinze wasn't his biggest fan.

"Kiefer worked with Freddie Prinze, Jr. more than 5 years ago, and this is the first he has heard of Freddie's grievances," Sutherland's rep said. "Kiefer enjoyed working with Freddie and wishes him the best."
