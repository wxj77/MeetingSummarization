LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A lot of people like Adam Sandler.

Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen star in "Funny People," the new film from Judd Apatow.

The box office earnings for many of his films are testament to his drawing power. Sandler's biggest comedic blockbusters include "Big Daddy," "The Waterboy" and "The Longest Yard," each of which has earned well over $150 million domestically.

He has seven other titles that have also passed the coveted $100 million mark.

The thing all these films have in common is that they are all comedies. So, it's likely safe to assume there are more than a few Hollywood execs nervously biting their knuckles right now, wondering how Sandler's latest big-screen offering, the dark comedy "Funny People" -- written and directed by his longtime friend Judd Apatow ("The 40-Year-Old Virgin") -- will fare.

Though hilarious at times, the film's overall story of a world-famous comedian's brush with a terminal illness is decidedly serious.  Watch Apatow and Sandler react to a doctor with an accent Â»

Much of the movie's personality can be summarized in one scene in particular in which Sandler and co-star Seth Rogen are sitting in a doctor's office receiving very bad news that they somehow turn into laughter. Sandler and Rogen talked to CNN about what went into creating that scene.
