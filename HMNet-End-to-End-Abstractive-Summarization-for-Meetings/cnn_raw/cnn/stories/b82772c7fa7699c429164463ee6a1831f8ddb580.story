Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Al Goodman, who sang baritone on such soul classics as "Love on a Two Way Street" and "Special Lady," died Monday, his family told CNN.

Goodman, 67, died of heart failure during surgery to remove a tumor at Hackensack Medical Center in New Jersey, according to his daughter, Rhonda Goodman.

Goodman was "joking and laughing" before his surgery, she said.

"There's mourning all over the world -- in England, in Germany and in Japan," said Marshall Thompson, leader of the Chi-Lites, on Tuesday. "We're all mourning for Al Goodman."

Goodman was a member of the Moments -- an R&B group that formed in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1968 -- along with Harry Ray and William Brown.  They topped the soul charts in 1970 with "Love on a Two Way Street" and again in 1975 with "Look at Me (I'm in Love)."

Last year, rapper Jay-Z sampled "Love on a Two Way Street" for his hit, "Empire State of Mind."

In 1978, the trio renamed itself Ray, Goodman and Brown.  A year later, they hit No. 1 with "Special Lady."  The group made regular appearances on the soul charts into the 1980s.  Their last Top Ten single was in 1986.

Goodman is survived by his wife of 34 years, Henrietta, five children and one grandson.

A funeral is planned for Monday at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in Englewood, New Jersey.
