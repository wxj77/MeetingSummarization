(CNN) -- Want to surf 4-foot waves or snorkel in coral reefs as the summer sun shines bright?

There's no need to book your flight to Hawaii or Palau. The top 10 water parks in the United States have waves, reefs, tubing and water slides.

Disney water parks came in first and second place for attendance among North American water parks on the 2013 Theme Index, which tracks theme park and water park attendance around the globe. Nearly 11 million people headed to the top 10 water parks in the United States in 2013, and about 4 million headed to two Disney World water parks in Florida.

The index, released this month as part of the TEA/AECOM Global Attractions Attendance Report, tracks water park attendance in North America, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and the Middle East.

On the global list, Chimelong Waterpark in Guangzhou, China, ranked No. 1 in the world for water park attendance, followed by two Disney World parks in second and third places. Parks in South Korea, Brazil and Australia joined other Orlando, Florida, parks to round out the top 10 most visited parks globally.
