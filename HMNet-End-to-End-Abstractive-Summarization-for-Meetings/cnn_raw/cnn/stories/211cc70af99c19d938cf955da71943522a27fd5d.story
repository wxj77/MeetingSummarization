(CNN) -- Deposed Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, appeared in court Sunday as his retrial resumed on charges involving the killing of hundreds of protesters during the popular 2011 uprising that led to his ouster.

Mubarak was convicted on the charges last year and sentenced to life in prison, but appealed the ruling and was granted a retrial.

A court ordered Mubarak released last week and placed under house arrest while he awaits a retrial.

The 85-year-old Mubarak had been held since shortly after he was removed from power.

The ousted autocratic leader's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration. He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had said that he was physically unfit to stand trial.

Opinion: What Mubarak's release means

Muslim Brotherhood trial

The spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood was also to appear in a Cairo courtroom Sunday to face charges of inciting violence that took the lives of eight protesters in the wake of former President Mohamed Morsy's ouster from power. Morsy was elected after Mubarak was toppled.

But Mohamed Badie did not appear in court.

Last week, the military arrested Badie, the group's supreme guide, and Safwat Hegazy, a preacher and hardline supporter of the movement. They were among about 100 members of the Muslim Brotherhood taken into custody on Tuesday.

Morsy, who was deposed by the military amid widespread protest over his rule, has been held since early July.

Egypt has been in turmoil since Morsy's removal from office, with the military battling Muslim Brotherhood members and other Morsy supporters.

This month, about 900 people -- citizens as well as members of security forces -- were killed. The deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo.
