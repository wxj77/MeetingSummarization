(CNN) -- A man wearing an Afghan military uniform attacked members of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in eastern Afghanistan Saturday, an ISAF spokesman said.

The gunman was killed and there were no ISAF casualties, the spokesman said.

So-called "green on blue" attacks killed dozens of coalition troops in 2012, prompting the U.S. command in Kabul to stop some joint operations with Afghan security forces.
