(CNN) -- Easter is upon us and, like clockwork, hordes of brightly wrapped chocolate bunnies and eggs have begun their domination of supermarket aisles.

While these sugar-filled options are sure to please the average eater, the true cocoa connoisseur might be left with a craving for something more.

Something better.

This list of the most unforgettable chocolate escapes across the world -- from soothing chocolate spa treatments to a chocolate molding masterclass -- guarantee a delicious Easter getaway.

The Chocolate Boutique Hotel (Bournemouth, UK)

Widely acclaimed as the planet's first chocolate-themed hotel, this heritage home-away-from-home has 15 unique rooms done up in rich mocha and caramel hues.

Events include everything from chocolate-shoe molding workshops to sleepovers with chocolate and wine pairings, do-it-yourself chocolate artwork (with white, dark and Belgian milk chocolate serving as paint material) and an in-room chocolate fountain.

Complimentary chocolate is delivered to each room daily.

We suggest packing pants with an elastic waistband.

The Hotel Hershey (Pennsylvania)

Proclaiming itself "the sweetest place on earth," Hershey, Pennsylvania, is the headquarters of The Hershey Company, the popular Hersheypark amusement center and, of course, the official Hershey Hotel.

Dedicated to all things chocolate, the property's activities include family s'mores roasts, chocolate bingo and plenty of sugary seasonal events such as an annual Easter egg hunt.

The on-site Chocolate Spa offers treatments like the Whipped Cocoa Bath, the Chocolate Bean Polish and the Chocolate Fondue Wrap.

Hotel Chocolat (St. Lucia)

This picturesque luxury retreat is located along the verdant cocoa groves of the Caribbean island's oldest plantation.

Guests can enjoy beautiful views, a top-notch spa, plush four-poster beds and plenty of desserts made from on-site beans.

What sets the place apart as a chocolate-lover's haven is the unique Tree-to-Bar experience.

The excursion includes a tour through the estate's cocoa groves and a tutorial on how to select and pick ripe cocoa pods.

It culminates in a chocolate bar workshop and tasting.

Three Ways House Hotel (Gloucestershire, UK)

This charming boutique hotel is home to the Pudding Club, an organization whose weekly meetings consist of a "Parade of Seven Puddings" and a vote-off for the top dessert.

In addition to several pudding-themed rooms, the inn caters to chocoholics -- there's a chocolate suite where even the pillows are designed to look like bonbons.

The real sugar rush comes from the Three Ways' special chocolate indulgence package, which includes a box of handmade chocolates, a chocolate-featured snack, dinner and breakfast, a chocolate treasure hunt and, finally, a chocolate cookery demonstration and tasting.
