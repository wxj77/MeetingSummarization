Economics, international politics, rocket science and careers are four subjects explored this Tuesday on CNN Student News. First up: U.S. cities like Boston are strapped for cash when it comes to their snow-removal budgets. Then, we examine why approval ratings are high for Russia's president despite the strains on his nation's economy. We'll explain the big goal of an upcoming rocket launch and look at the salaries of photographers and helicopter pilots.
