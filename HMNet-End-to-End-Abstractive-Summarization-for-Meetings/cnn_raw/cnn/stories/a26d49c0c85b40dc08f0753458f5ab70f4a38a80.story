(CNN) -- The annual sporting jamboree is the highlight of the social calendar for rugby fans who flock to the Hong Kong Stadium in their thousands.

Fancy dress and beer-fueled boisterousness are the order of the day for many of the 40,000-strong crowd as a party atmosphere descends on the city for three days at the end of March.

On the pitch, 28 teams will battle it out in a total of 71 matches with defending champions Fiji looking to repeat their recent success at the Japan Sevens.
