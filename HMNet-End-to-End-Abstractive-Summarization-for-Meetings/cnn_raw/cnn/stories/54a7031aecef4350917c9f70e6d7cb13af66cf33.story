(CNN)Can anything stop Pep Guardiola's irresistible Bavarian machine?

It doesn't look likely on this form.

Five separate players scored as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich thrashed a woeful Hamburg 8-0 at the Allianz Arena Saturday.

Thomas Muller, Mario Gotze, Arjen Robben, Robert Lewandowski and Franck Ribery did the damage with Muller, Gotze and Robben each scoring twice.

Bayern returns to Champions League action on Tuesday night against Shaktar Donetsk of the Ukraine but refused to rest up against its struggling northern opponents despite being three goals up at half time.

The reigning German champions rolled in a further five goals after the break, maintaining its eight point lead atop the table over second placed Wolfsburg who were involved in a high scoring affair of an entirely different nature Saturday.

A 93-minute goal from Bas Dost ensured Die Wolfe claimed a dramatic 5-4 victory over sixth-placed Bayer Leverkusen.

The late strike was the Dutchman's fourth goal of a pulsating game in which Wolfsburg had led 3-0 at half time before being pegged back at 4-4 in the closing stages.

Leverkusen's Heung-Min Sun also grabbed a hat-trick although the Korean's star-showing was somewhat overshadowed by Dost's match-winning heroics.

In Saturday's other Bundesliga fixtures, Borussia Dortmund's mini-revival continued with a 4-2 victory at home to Mainz.

The result lifts Jurgen Klopp's men up to 16th position and clear of the relegation and playoff places where it has found itself in recent weeks.

There was no such joy for VFB Stuttgart, however, which remains rooted to the foot of the table after going down 2-1 to HGV Hoffenheim.

Elsewhere, an injry-time header from Borussia Moenchengladbach's Granit Xhaka sealed a 1-0 win over regional rivals Cologne.

However, the goal sparked scenes of anger among a group of Cologne fans dressed all in white who invaded the pitch and briefly clashed with police before order was restored.
