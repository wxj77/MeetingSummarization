(Cover Media) -- Alyssa Milano doesn't think every child actor is bound to get in trouble with the law.

The 40-year-old actress appeared on screens as a preteen in the 1980s sitcom "Who's The Boss," and thinks her genuine gift of being an actress has kept her from going off the rails.

"I hope it's talent," she told Maxim magazine. "That was an era when TV child actors just didn't work after their show was over."

The "Mistresses" star believes that only certain people have been able to hold on to regular jobs while maintaining their wholesome image.

She counts "Married With Children's" Christina Applegate, 41, as another actress who has done well out of starting work early in life.

"I think Christina Applegate and I are the only two who maintained some sort of career path past the shows that launched us," she confessed.

Milano welcomed her first child with her CAA agent husband David Bugliari in 2011.

She thinks that troubled stars like Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Bynes didn't have much chance of have a healthy career and personal life to begin with.

"I have a great family, and I look at a lot of these kids who struggle in the industry and think they'd have struggled no matter what they did," she admitted.
