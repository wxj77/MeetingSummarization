New York (CNN) -- Amtrak Northeast Corridor service between New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, continued to be affected by ongoing signal problems Wednesday in New Jersey, Amtrak said in a 10 a.m. statement. In addition, while New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor service improved as the morning progressed, the line was still suffering delays into the afternoon, the railroad's website said in a 12:24 p.m. update.

The outage was caused by a downed tree that fell into the overhead wire system near Hamilton, New Jersey, Amtrak said.

As a result, Amtrak trains were moving at greatly reduced speeds, with some trains canceled due to associated congestion.

Amtrak said its personnel were working to repair the problem, but passengers should expect westbound/southbound delays of 90 to 120 minutes and 60 to 90 minute eastbound/northbound delays.

No trains were stranded between stations, and passengers were being re-accommodated on other trains where available, Amtrak said.

Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole couldn't say how long trains would be traveling with reduced speed and frequency before service would be completely restored.

New Jersey Transit Northeast Corridor service between New Brunswick, New Jersey, and New York was back on schedule or close to on schedule in both directions, according to the transit website.

However, 30- to 45-minute delays plagued the Northeast Corridor line into the afternoon because of signal problems, the website said.

Service was suspended most of the morning in both directions between Trenton, New Jersey, and New Brunswick, because of the signal problems. Passengers were advised to get on the 11:17 a.m. train departing from Trenton.

Transit and suburban buses were accepting rail tickets and passes for fares Wednesday morning, the website said.
