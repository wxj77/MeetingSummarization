(CNN)Everything was going to plan for Cowdenbeath during its Scottish Championship clash with table-topping Heart of Midlothian Saturday.

The game was 25 minutes old and the relegation threatened-side, ironically and lovingly nicknamed the Blue Brazil by Scottish football fans, had managed to shut-out their hosts and in-form opponents.

Then, the goals began to arrive.

Minutes 26, 27 and 29 saw Hearts Dutch striker Genero Zeefuik grab a quickfire hat-trick, the third after a penalty and red-card to Cowdenbeath defender Lewis Toshney.

A brief lull followed before Hearts scored again in minutes 33 and 39 through Sam Nicholson and Jamie Walker respectively.

And while half-time provided Cowdenbeath some brief respite, another torrent of goals was to come when play resumed.

By the end of the 90 minutes, Hearts had scored five more times to ensure an astonishing 10-0 victory.

Morgaro Gomis, Alim Ozturk Danny Wilson and substitute Osman Sow (twice) did the second-half damage.

"I've never been involved in a result like that in my entire career," said Hearts head coach, Robbie Neilson after the game.

"I spoke to the players at half time and told them to keep going, try to score more," he added.

The result matches Cowdenbeath's heaviest ever loss, an 11-1 reverse to Clyde way back in 1951.

But that's still nowhere near the record of the biggest defeat ever recorded in senior Scottish football.

That distinctive honor remains in the possession of wonderfully named Bon Accord who were trounced 36-0 by Arbroath in 1880.

It might be little consolation to Cowdenbeath tonight, but at least they were along way off Bon Accord levels of ineptitude.
