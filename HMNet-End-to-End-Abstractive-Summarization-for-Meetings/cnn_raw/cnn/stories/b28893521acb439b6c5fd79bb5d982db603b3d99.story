(CNN)  -- Sea The Stars showed a blistering turn of pace to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and confirm his status as one of the greatest race horses in history.

Sea The Stars finishes clear of the field to win Europe's top horse race.

It was the fifth consecutive win for the three-year-old colt, including the 2,000 Guineas and English Derby, as he claimed Europe's premier flat race on Sunday.

Trained in Ireland by John Oxx, Sea The Stars was boxed in approaching the final furlong, but jockey Mick Kinane found a gap before bursting clear of the field.

He relegated Youmzain, ridden by the returning Kieren Fallon, into second place with seven-time Arc winning trainer Andre Fabre's Cavalryman, under Frankie Dettori, in third.

Breeders Cup Turf champion Conduit was finishing fast but could do no better than fourth.

Sea The Stars started as a 4-6 favorite and was supported by a huge following, being cheered to the rafters in the ring even prior to the race.

But the Aidan O'Brien-trained Set Sail and Grand Ducal set a blistering pace with the former leading by 15 lengths entering the home straight of the mile and a half (2,400 meters) race.

Unbeaten French filly Stacelita then hit the front before 50-year-old Kinane and the superstar Sea The Stars worked their magic to emulate his dam (mother) Urban Sea who won the race in 1993.
