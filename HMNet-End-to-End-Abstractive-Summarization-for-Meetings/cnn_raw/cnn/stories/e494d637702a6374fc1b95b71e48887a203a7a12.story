(CNN Student News ) -- April 14, 2014

This week begins with a report on wildfires in Chile and an update on an Ebola outbreak in West Africa. We take a look at how journalists prepare to work in areas hit by disease or disaster, and we explore the religious significance of Palm Sunday and Passover. Finally, we examine technology that's intended to protect ice hockey players from head injuries.

Discussion Questions:
