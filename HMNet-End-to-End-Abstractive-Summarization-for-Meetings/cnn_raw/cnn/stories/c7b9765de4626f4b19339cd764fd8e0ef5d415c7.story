(CNN)  -- Lionel Messi netted a double as Barcelona moved ever closer to retaining the Spanish league title with a 4-1 win over Tenerife at the Nou Camp on Tuesday night.

The strikes were the 30th and 31st for the La Liga top scorer and the victory puts the pressure on arch-rivals Real Madrid for their tricky trip to Real Mallorca on Wednesday.

It left Barcelona four points clear of Real, who must win their game in hand to keep their own title hopes alive.

Argentina ace Messi put Barcelona ahead after 17 minutes and added a second in the final minute to seal victory against relegation-threatened Tenerife, who stunned the champions by equalizing just before half-time through Roman Martinez.

It followed a mistake by home captain Carles Puyol, but Barca upped the pace after the break with goals from Bojan Krkic just after the hour mark and substitute Pedro Rodriguez giving them a comfortable cushion.

Messi's late goal gave the scoreline a flattering look in a match played in driving rain, as Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes conceded.

"It was a difficult night due to the weather and the fixture list is already taking its toll but we gave our all," Valdes told AFP.

"It is a very competitive league and we have won our game and now we just have to wait."

Barcelona will be hoping Mallorca can come up trumps with their strong home record because they face a tough trip to Champions League hopefuls Sevilla on Saturday.

Meanwhile in other action on Tuesday, Valencia clinched their place in the Champions League qualifying round, by clinching third spot, with a 3-1 home win over bottom club Xerez.

Spanish international Juan Mata equalized a first half goal for Xerez with a superb free kick then added a second after the break.

Mata then set up David Silva for Valencia's third.
