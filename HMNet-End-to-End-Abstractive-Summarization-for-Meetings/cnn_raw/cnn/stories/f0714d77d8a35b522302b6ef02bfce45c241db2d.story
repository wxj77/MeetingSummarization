(CNN) -- A tour bus transporting Willie Nelson's band spun out of control in a storm and crashed into a Texas bridge pillar before dawn Saturday, injuring three of five band members, according to police and the band.

Willie Nelson wasn't on the bus, the musician's website said.

The three band members were hospitalized, and Willie Nelson and Family postponed the tour's four remaining dates in November and will resume the tour as scheduled in December, the website said.

"No one suffered serious injuries. Paul English injured his ankle, Billy English suffered a bruised hip and crew member Tom Hawkins has a cracked rib. The other family members on the bus are sore but everyone is expected to recover fully," Nelson's website said.

Authorities had earlier reported that English broke his hip.

The crash occurred on Interstate 30 outside Sulphur Springs, and the bus driver was trying to negotiate heavy rains and winds, said Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Sylvia Jennings.

The crash occurred 80 miles east of Dallas.

Nelson's website said the band believes the accident occurred "due to icy conditions on the road."

The bus was swept off the road and crashed into a bridge pillar, Jennings said. The bus was carrying five band members and the driver.

Willie Nelson and Family was scheduled to perform in Robinsonville, Mississippi, on Saturday, and in Jackson, Mississippi, on Sunday, the band's website said.
