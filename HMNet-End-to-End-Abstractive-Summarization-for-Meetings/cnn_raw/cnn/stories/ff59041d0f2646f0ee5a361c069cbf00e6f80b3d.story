(CNN) -- After a rocket landed late Saturday in its territory, Israel retaliated by going after "two terror activity sites in the southern and in the central Gaza Strip," its military said.

Israel Defense Forces said on its blog that the rocket fired out of Gaza landed in Sdot Negev Regional Council around 11 p.m. (6 p.m. ET), spurring sirens to go off there.

The military subsequently tweeted that there were "no injuries." An IDF spokesman told CNN that the rocket caused no notable destruction, having landed in an open area.

That led to Israel's retaliatory strike against targets that IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said are "part of the terrorist support network, enhancing terror capabilities against Israel and it civilians."

"As long as Hamas enables its henchmen to attack Israel, these sites will not be immune from our watchful eye and operational strike, while they are used to formulate, train and develop malicious terrorist intentions," Lerner said in a statement.

CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.
