(CNN) -- It may be a case of wishful thinking, but a British tabloid is reporting that Kim Kardashian may be pursuing a music career again.

According to The Sun, the newlywed has enlisted the help of husband Kanye West as well as vocal and songwriting coaches to help her break into the industry.

Now, we say wishful thinking because embarking on such a venture would just give folks the opportunity to write even more about Kardashian (raising our hands over here, too). That's the whole point, isn't it?

Still, it's not that she hasn't tried before.

Remember the reality star's single, "Jam (Turn It Up)," from 2011? Most people probably don't. The song gained practically no traction.

In 2012 Kardashian was quoted as saying that she would never try to launch a singing career. "No, I'd never (make another single), that was just for fun, and for charity," she said at the time.

Proceeds from her single, which failed to make the charts, reportedly went to fund St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital.
