(CNN) -- The Cumberland River in Nashville, Tennessee, is predicted to be at flood stage overnight Friday, and flood levels should begin to fall after daylight, according to the National Weather Service.

Flood warnings have been issued along the river .

Flash flood warnings were in effect Thursday for parts of middle Tennessee after heavy rain battered the state overnight. The rain has subsided in and around Nashville, but more is in the forecast for the end of the week, the National Weather Service said.

Heavy rain in parts of the state this week caused rivers and creeks to crest, and sent flood waters into the streets.  Dozens of roads were closed and some schools in middle Tennessee were closed or starting late Thursday, the Macon County (Tennessee) Times reported.

Some areas, like the town of Red Boiling Springs, were pounded with as much as eight inches of rain in a 12-hour stretch Wednesday.

Flood waters rushed into the town causing officials to close the entire downtown, police told CNN-affiliate WKRN.

"There were so many places that were dangerous to attempt to cross," said Jacob Jordan, an officer with the Red Boiling Springs Police Department. "I have no idea where the road was. This was all one big body of water."

The rain comes as some Tennessee residents were still recovering from the devastating floods that hit the area in May.  Dozens of people died in those floods. The federal government declared 42 counties disaster areas and the flooding was blamed for more than $1.5 billion in property damage in the Nashville area.
