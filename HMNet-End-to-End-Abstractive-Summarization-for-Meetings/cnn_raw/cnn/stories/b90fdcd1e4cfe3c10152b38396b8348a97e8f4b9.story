(CNN) -- A Canadian woman accused of stalking Alec Baldwin began sending "a series of annoying and unsolicited communications" to the actor after having dinner with him in fall 2010, according to a criminal complaint filed Monday.

Genevieve Sabourin, 40, was arrested by New York police Sunday on five misdemeanor counts of harassment and stalking after she appeared at Baldwin's Manhattan home.

A judge released Sabourin on her own recognizance after a court appearance Monday, but ordered her to return for a May 14 hearing. Until then, she must keep away from Baldwin, 53, and not send him any e-mails or text messages, the judge ordered.

Their encounters, including an incident Friday night, during which she showed up at a Lincoln Center movie screening hosted by Baldwin, has caused him to suffer "anxiety, annoyance and fear," the court filing said.

She sent Baldwin a dozen e-mails last week that added to his stress, the complaint said.

"I NEED TO START MY NEW LIFE, WITH MY NEW NAME, WITH MY NEW CARRIER IN MY NEW COUNTRY HELP MY NEWLY HUSBAND, YOU!" an April 4 e-mail said.

"I NEED YOU NOW, PLEASE ALEC COME AND PICK ME UP NOW. I AM LESS THAN 10 MIN AWAY FROM YOU TONIGHT. SAY I DO TO ME," another message the same day read.

"I'M EXISTED ABOUT THAT PORTION OF THE PROCESS, CREATING GENEVIEVE BALDWIN AND GET ALL OF WHAT I WANT IS THE BEST PART," she wrote, according to the court document.

Two days later, Baldwin got this e-mail:

"I HOPE I DID GOOD ENOUGH LAST NIGHT FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS. I HOPE I DID NOT RUIN EVERYTHING BY MY LACK OF FREEDOM AND PASSIVE ACTIONS...IHATE MYSELF FOR BEING SO PASSIVE. BUT I AM EXHAUSTED AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO, THEN PROTECT MYSELF, I AM VERY WEAK NOW AND VULNERABLE...AND SO, I PLAYED DEFENSIVE INSTEAD OF GOING FOR IT. I AM SO SORRY, I DID NOT KNOW."

A e-mail sent to Baldwin Saturday read in part:

"THERE ARE VERY CRUCIAL/VITAL THINGS I NEED HERE AND TODAY, I WANT YOU TO BE THE ONE GIVING THEM TO ME. I NEED TO SEE YOU NOW."

The complaint described Baldwin's previous relationship with the woman as limited to their meeting "briefly for dinner in the fall of 2010."

However, she served as a unit publicist for the 2002 Eddie Murphy movie "The Adventures of Pluto Nash," in which Baldwin had a cameo role. It was not immediately clear whether Baldwin and Sabourin met on the set.

Sabourin is described in several media reports as an actress; however, her online LinkedIn resume lists her current occupation as a film producer in Montreal. Police confirmed she is from Montreal.

The stalking suspect's acting resume is sparse, with a handful of small roles in Canadian TV productions, the last in 2007, according to the Internet Movie Database.

Her biggest film acting credit appears to be in Tom Sizemore's "Swindle," a 2002 crime thriller, according to the IMDb.

"As you know, stalking is a serious issue, so we've turned this matter over to the New York Police Department," Baldwin's publicist told CNN on Monday.

Baldwin is engaged to marry Hilaria Thomas, a 27-year-old yoga instructor.
