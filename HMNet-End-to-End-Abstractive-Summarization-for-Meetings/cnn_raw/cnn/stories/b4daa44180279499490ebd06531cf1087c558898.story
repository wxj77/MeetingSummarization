(CNN) -- A goal from Liverpool's forgotten man Stewart Downing helped Brendan Rodgers' side beat Russian outfit Anzhi Makhachkala in the Europa League and go top of Group A.

The winger, who signed for a reputed $32 million back in 2011, grabbed only his fourth goal for the club to see off Anzhi, led by veteran Dutch coach Guus Hiddink.

It could have been a more comfortable margin for Liverpool but Daniel Agger had a goal ruled out when he headed the ball out of Anzhi keeper Vladimir Gabulov's hands and fired home. The defender was yellow carded for his efforts.

The Russian side, who boasted four time African Player of the Year Samuel Eto'o among their ranks, failed to threaten regularly.

Victory represented perfect preparation for Liverpool as they head into one of their biggest games of the season, against Merseyside neighbors Everton on Sunday.

"Great credit to the players after that," Rodgers told match broadcaster ITV. "I haven't even thought about the derby, with our squad it's one game at a time.

"We had good control of the game and when we had to dig deep they put their bodies on the line for us.

"Stewart Downing scored a brilliant goal. He is a wonderful technician off either foot. He has had a rough ride here, it's been a tough time but he is a good guy and an important member of our team and he got a good reception from the Kop."
