(CNN) -- It wasn't a typical day on the set of the hit game show "Family Feud" on Monday.

Alana Thompson, the 7-year-old star of "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo," and her family faced off against "Cake Boss" Buddy Valastro and his family.

The casts of the TLC reality shows put their vivacious and raw personalities to the test. Deep country accents and trash talking from both sides filled the Atlanta Civic Center, where the show was taped.

Each family clearly had a competitive nature, but it was all for a good cause on Monday.

The winning clan brought in $20,000 for a charity they chose before the game.

The "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" bunch played for Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders.

The "Cake Boss" crew competed for the Momma Mary Foundation, a charity dedicated to creating awareness about and finding a cure for ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

Comedian Steve Harvey hosted the episode.

Since the premiere of "Family Feud" in 1976, the show has been one of television's most popular and enduring game shows.

Honey Boo Boo's 13-year old sister, Lauryn "Pumpkin" Thompson, was starstruck. She stumbled over her words when she met Harvey, but she was able to clearly articulate "I'm Pumpkin, and I'm a huge fan" about five times.

The "Cake Boss" family members ribbed Valastro several times for being such a spoiled husband -- particularly about how his mother clipped his toenails for him until he was married. Harvey picked up on this theme and kept the jokes going at Valstro's expense.

Both families exhibited huge personalities. "You better redneckognize," said Honey Boo Boo in an interview with CNN before the show taping began.

So who won? You'll have to wait until the new season begins in September.
