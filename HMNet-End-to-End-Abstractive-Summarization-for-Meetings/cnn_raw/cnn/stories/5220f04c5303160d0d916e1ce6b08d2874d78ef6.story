(CNN) -- Guess who's back? Back again? Shady's back! Tell a video game fan!

There hasn't been new Eminem music in a while, though he did announce that he'd have a new album out in 2013 thanks to a hat he was selling. Now comes a brand new track called "Survival," which will not only appear on said upcoming album but also on the soundtrack to "Call of Duty: Ghosts," the latest entry in the massively successful fist-person shooter franchise.

When we last heard Slim Shady, he was teaming up with his old pal Royce Da 5'9â€³ for the return of the team Bad Meets Evil, and they scored hits with "Fast Lane" and the Bruno Mars-assisted "Lighters." The last time Marshall Mathers rapped solo, it was for 2010â€²s "Recovery," which yielded the chart-toppers "Not Afraid" and "Love the Way You Lie."

More details about Eminem's new album, including a release date and a single, will be forthcoming. For now, give "Survival," a guitar-heavy banger cut from the same cloth as "Won't Back Down," a listen.
