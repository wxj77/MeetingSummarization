(CNN) -- For the past decade, millions of Americans have passed on the biggest football game of the year to watch something way cuter -- "Puppy Bowl." By now it's an established fact: Television doesn't get much more adorable than puppies.

"Puppy Bowl," Animal Planet's alternative programming to the NFL's Super Bowl, is the sublime result of pairing a bunch of wiggly puppies -- 66, in fact -- with squeaky toys and a mini-stadium set. Add a "rufferee" and a kitty-filled halftime, and every floppy tackle or slobbered-on football inspires an unintelligible burst of baby talk and giggles. That's the power of puppies!

Ahead of this year's most big game, we take a look at Puppy Bowl 2014, by the numbers.
