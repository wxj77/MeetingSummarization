(CNN) -- Actress Emma Roberts and boyfriend Evan Peters "are working together to move past" an incident that resulted in her domestic violence arrest in Canada last week, their representative said.

Roberts, 22, was arrested after police were called to a Montreal hotel July 7, according to police.

"It was an unfortunate incident and misunderstanding," the rep said in a written statement to CNN. "Ms. Roberts was released after questioning and the couple are working together to move past it."

Roberts -- the niece of Julia Roberts and daughter of Eric Roberts -- was in Montreal with Peters to film an episode for the FX series "American Horror Story."
