(CNN)  -- Ida has been downgraded from a tropical storm to a tropical depression as it lost momentum during its approach to the U.S. Gulf Coast early Tuesday.

But the storm is still spreading plenty of rain across the Southeast, generally 3 to 6 inches with isolated maximum storm totals of 8 inches. This could continue through Wednesday evening from the eastern Gulf Coast into the Southern Mid-Atlantic states.

"Ida has lost tropical characteristics and its winds are expected to slowly diminish during the next day or so," according to a 10 a.m. ET advisory from the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center.

Ida made its initial landfall at 6:40 a.m. ET at Dauphin Island, Alabama, which is located five miles off the Alabama coast, the center said. Ida made another landfall around 8 a.m. ET just northwest of Bon Secour, Alabama, an advisory said.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph with higher gusts, the center said. Ida is moving toward the northeast near 9 mph.

The storm was about 30 miles east-southeast of Mobile, Alabama, and about 25 miles west-northwest of Pensacola, Florida, the latest advisory said. The hurricane center said the tropical depression advisory is the last one they will issue on the storm system.

The storm's heavy rains have flooded some roads and washed up debris in parts of Alabama and Florida, and the storm knocked out power to about 2,000 people in the western part of the Florida panhandle.
