(CNN) -- CNN has been awarded one of the highest honors in international journalism -- a Golden Nymph -- for its coverage of the earthquake in Haiti in the 24-hour news program category.

The award was presented Thursday at the Monte Carlo Television Festival. Other nominees included BBC News, Sky News, France 24 and Russia Today.

CNN International Executive Vice President and Managing Director Tony Maddox said: "This award comes as CNN marks 30 years of journalistic enterprise. Our coverage of Haiti stands among the many proud moments of CNN's history in covering the stories that help shape our world.

"It is an honor to be recognized by our industry peers at this prestigious festival."

Within minutes of January's Haiti earthquake, which killed more than 200,000 people, CNN began covering the story.  Within 24 hours, and before most military and relief organizations arrived, CNN had eight reporting teams -- 34 people -- on the ground, with more on the way.

Once on the scene, CNN quickly established itself as a vital missing link -- helping worried relatives reach their loved ones in Haiti, while helping Haitians communicate word of their survival, their needs, and their despair.

The Golden Nymph accolade comes in the wake of an exceptional year for the international news channel.

CNN revamped its schedule launching 10 new European prime time programs; opened its fourth international production center in Abu Dhabi; brought in-house the production of its award-winning documentary strand "World's Untold Stories"; relaunched its international and domestic Web sites and introduced new graphics, music, studios, and a tagline: "Go Beyond Borders."

CNN has continued to invest beyond breaking news in intelligent and compelling newsgathering, sports, feature and documentary programming across all digital platforms, putting audience connectivity at the heart of its output through initiatives such as iReport.
