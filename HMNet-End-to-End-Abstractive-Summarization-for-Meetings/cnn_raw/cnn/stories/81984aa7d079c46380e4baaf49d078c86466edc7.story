Georgetown, Guyana (CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Guyana is warning American citizens against flying out of the country on Caribbean Airlines flights bound for the United States for the next two days.

The embassy said it received unconfirmed threat information about such Caribbean Airlines flights -- but did not offer specifics.

"Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy advises all U.S. Citizens in Guyana traveling on Caribbean Airlines (CAL) to the United States from Monday, February 10, through Wednesday, February 12, 2014, to make alternate travel arrangements," the embassy said in a statement.

Late Sunday night, the government of Guyana announced that it had activated emergency security plans and raised the terror threat level at the country's main international airport in wake of threats to Caribbean Airlines flights.

Caribbean Airlines has added additional security measures and is cooperating with authorities, the company said in a statement Monday. It said all flights are operating as scheduled.
