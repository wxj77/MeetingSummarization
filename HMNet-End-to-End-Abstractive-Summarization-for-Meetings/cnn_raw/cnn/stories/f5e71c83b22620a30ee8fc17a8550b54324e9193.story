(CNN) -- One U.S. Army soldier was killed Thursday and two others wounded when one soldier shot another, then turned the gun on himself at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, authorities said.

All three soldiers were from the 525th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade, the installation said in a statement. The shooting occurred during a unit safety brief, said Fort Bragg spokesman Col. Kevin Arata.

The suspected gunman was injured and was taken into custody, Arata said. A third soldier nearby suffered slight injuries from the shooting, which occurred in a unit area, he said.

"We don't yet know the reasons for the shooting, but are working with the unit and the affected families to help them through this difficult period," he said.

Notification of next of kin was under way, he said. Special agents from the Army Criminal Investigation Command were on the scene and investigating.
