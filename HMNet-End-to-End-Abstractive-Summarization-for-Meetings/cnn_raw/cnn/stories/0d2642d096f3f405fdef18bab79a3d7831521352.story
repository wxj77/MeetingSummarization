(CNN) -- A morbidly obese Saudi Arabian man has lost 330 pounds (150 kilograms) since the Saudi king ordered him hospitalized three months ago, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.

In August, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia ordered Khalid bin Mohsen Shaari, who then weighed 1,345 pounds (610 kilograms), to undergo treatment in the capital, Riyadh. Shaari, estimated to be in his late teens, was unable to move by himself and was transferred from Jazan in southern Saudi Arabia.

His weight loss followed an intense nutritional and surgical treatment program a team of 21 specialists developed at the King Fahd Medical City, the agency said.

"The patient is responding well to treatment and is continuing to improve, especially the psychological aspect, " Dr. Aa'ed al-Qahtani, head of the medical team, told the news agency.

Shaari's most serious health issues are being managed, including heart and lung problems, diabetes and swelling and lack of mobility in the legs, according to al-Qahtani.

Al-Qahtani told the agency that Shaari is scheduled for one more "surgical phase" after which, if successful, he could return to normal life.
