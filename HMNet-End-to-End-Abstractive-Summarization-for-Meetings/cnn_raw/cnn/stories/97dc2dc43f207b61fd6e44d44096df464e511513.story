(CNN) -- Kate Hudson's ex, Black Crowes rocker Chris Robinson, is going to be a dad again, a representative for the band confirmed in a statement Tuesday.

Chris Robinson and girlfriend Allison Bridges will be having a child in early 2010.

Robinson and girlfriend Allison Bridges, who have been dating for two years, are expecting their first child in early 2010, the statement said.

The baby will be the 42-year-old frontman's second child --Â­ he and Hudson have a 5 1/2-year-old son, Ryder Russell, together.
