(CNN)Here's one reboot that would be out of this world.

TV Wise is reporting that Fox is very close to pushing the button on a new season of "The X-Files," which aired from 1993 to 2002. The original stars, Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny, are said to be on board for the revival of the hit show about a pair of FBI agents who investigate the paranormal.

If social media are any indication, fans really want to believe.

It appears that timing will play a crucial factor in whether the project gets off the ground, as both Anderson and Duchovny have other commitments. Anderson stars in the hugely popular BBC drama "The Fall," while Duchovny's NBC series "Aquarius" is set to debut in May.

Both actors are fully aware that fans really, really want to see them back as professional partners/lovers Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. In February, Duchovny said during an appearance on CBS' "The Talk" that bringing the show back was a very real possibility.

"It looks good; that's all I'll say," the actor said. "It looks very good."

Fox has confirmed that it is eyeing a reboot. Series creator Chris Carter is reportedly also on board for the new project.

The show was so popular that it spurred two feature films, a spinoff series about Mulder's nutty sidekicks the Lone Gunmen, a comic book series and a board game.
