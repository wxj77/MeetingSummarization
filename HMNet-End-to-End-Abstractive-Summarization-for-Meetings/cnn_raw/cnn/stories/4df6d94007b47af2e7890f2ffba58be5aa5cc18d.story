(CNN) -- An Ohio man accused of killing three women and wrapping their bodies in trash bags in East Cleveland pleaded not guilty in the case Wednesday, the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court said.

Michael Madison, 35, pleaded not guilty to 14 counts in the deaths of Angela Deskins, 38, Shetisha Sheeley, 28, and Shirellda Terry.

The first pretrial hearing is set for August 6. Madison is being held with bail set at $6 million.

The three bodies were found near Madison's East Cleveland apartment -- at different sites within a few blocks from one another -- on July 19 and 20, police said.

More questions than answers in Cleveland's run on high-profile crime

The indictment charges Madison with two counts of murder for each woman: one alleging murder and the other alleging murder while kidnapping. He's also charged with three counts of kidnapping, three counts of gross abuse of a body, one count of rape, and one count of having a firearm despite being a convicted felon.

Madison is a registered sex offender, having been convicted of attempted rape in 2002.

New charges accuse suspect of rape

A grand jury indicted him on the 14 counts Tuesday. When his bail was set on July 22, Madison had been charged only with three counts of aggravated murder and three counts of kidnapping.

The bodies were discovered after someone noticed a foul odor coming from a garage he leased, police said.

One body was found in the garage; another was found in the basement of an empty home; and another was discovered in a field, police said. The decomposed bodies were wrapped similarly in plastic garbage bags and taped up, authorities said.

Madison was arrested after a standoff at his mother's Cleveland house.
