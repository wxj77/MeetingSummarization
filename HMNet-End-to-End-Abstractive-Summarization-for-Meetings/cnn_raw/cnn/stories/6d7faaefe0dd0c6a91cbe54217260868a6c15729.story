Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Indian authorities Tuesday slapped a curfew on Srinagar and other towns after the arrest of a major separatist leader in an attempt to stave off violence that has killed over 100 people in the last four months.

Masarat Alam Bhat, the general secretary of the hard-line All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) group and a close aide of the octogenarian separatist leader, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, was arrested Monday evening in a Srinagar suburb.

Bhat has been evading arrest since June when he launched the so-called "Quit Kashmir campaign" which set off a sequence of shutdowns, protests, marches and curfews that have virtually brought life in Indian administered Kashmir to a standstill for over four months.

The accompanying clashes between pro-independence protesters and Indian security forces have left 108 dead and hundreds others wounded, some of them crippled for life.

"We arrested him yesterday evening," said police officer Muzaffar Ahmad.

Bhat was immediately taken to an undisclosed location in Srinagar for questioning. Authorities described Bhat's arrest as "a major success."

The hard-line separatist leader, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, reacting to Bhat's arrest said, "Arrests and detentions are part and parcel of the freedom movement. The arrest is painful but the struggle will continue."

Fearing trouble in the wake of his arrest, authorities imposed a curfew in Srinagar and other major north Kashmir towns and deployed police and paramilitary forces to prevent violence, according police.

The mountainous Kashmir region is divided among Pakistan, China and India. In the past, India has poured thousands of security forces into its part of Kashmir to fight what India called a Pakistan-inspired insurgency. However, since the defeat of the insurgency, Indian forces have found themselves fighting Kashmiris who say they have suffered oppression and want independence from Hindu-dominated India.
