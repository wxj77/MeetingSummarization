(CNN) -- Former Serb international midfielder Sinisa Mihajlovic has been sacked as coach of Serie A side Fiorentina following a 1-0 defeat by Chievo on Sunday.

The 42-year-old Mihajlovic, who played for Roma, Sampdoria, Lazio and Inter Milan in a sparkling playing career, has been relieved of his duties with the club lying 11th in the Italian league table.

Mihajlovic had been under intense pressure this season and Sunday's defeat prompted the club's board to act, with Delio Rossi already being named as his replacement.

Rossi, 51, is best known for two spells as coach of Palermo, guiding them to the Europa League on both occasions.

However, Rossi fell out with controversial Palermo owner Maurizio Zamparini, who refused to renew his contract in the close season after sacking him following a 7-0 thrashing by Udinese, only to re-appoint him again a month later.

As well as a distinguished playing career in Italy, Mihajlovic had also coached Serie A clubs Bologna and Catania, before being named Fiorentina coach at the start of last season in succession to Cesare Prandelli, who left to coach the Italian national side.

Mihajlovic, who led Fiorentina ninth place last season, is the sixth Serie A coach to lose his job this season after Roberto Donadoni (Cagliari), Stefano Pioli (Palmero), Gian Piero Gasperini (Inter Milan), Pierpaolo Bisoli (Bologna) and Marco Giampaolo (Cesena).
