(CNN) -- A Brazilian journalist detained by authorities while reporting from Libya was released Thursday and will leave the country Friday, Libyan authorities said.

The whereabouts of Andrei Netto, a correspondent for Brazil's Estado do Sao Paulo newspaper, were unknown since Sunday, the last time he communicated with his newspaper. He is staying at the home of the Brazilian ambassador in Libya pending his removal, the newspaper reported.

Netto was detained for entering the country illegally through the Tunisian border, the Libyan Embassy in Brazil said in a written statement. Another reporter, Ghaith Abdul-Ahad of Britain's Guardian newspaper, was with Netto at the time of his detention, but officials gave no information on him.

"His detention was for his own protection, given the large concern of the government for the safety of the foreign media," the Libyan Embassy said.

Before Thursday, the last that Estado knew about its reporter was that he was around the city of Zawiya, a scene of fighting between opposition forces and forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. That was around the last time The Guardian heard from Abdul-Ahad, the newspaper reported.

The British newspaper has been in contact with Libyan government officials in Tripoli and London regarding his disappearance, the newspaper reported.

Abdul-Ahad, an Iraqi national, has been a staff correspondent for the paper since 2004, the newspaper said.

On Wednesday, three BBC journalists who had also been detained outside of Zawiya told of beatings and mock executions that they and other detainees were subjected to by their captors.

The three -- Feras Killani, Goktay Koraltan and Chris Cobb-Smith -- said that Libyan authorities took them into custody and seized their cameras and other equipment Monday at a checkpoint six miles south of Zawiya.
