(CNN Student News) -- October 16, 2013

As we hit the mid-point of the week, CNN Student News reports on a diplomatic meeting to discuss Iran's nuclear program, and we cover the impact of a powerful earthquake in the Philippines. We also share the story of the newest Medal of Honor recipient. Plus, after a report about a restaurant where diners eat in silence, we ask students to consider whether they could make it through a mute meal.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, Maps pertaining to today's show, and a place for you to leave feedback.
