(CNN) -- Britain's Prince William is going back to school to prepare for when his father becomes the king.

The Duke of Cambridge will attend a 10-week agriculture management course at the University of Cambridge starting in January, Kensington Palace announced Monday.

What William, 31, learns during the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership could help him when he takes over responsibility for the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate that includes farmland, from Prince Charles.

The seminars, lectures and meetings are a "bespoke programme," meaning they are customized for William.

"The course has been designed to help provide The Duke with an understanding of contemporary issues affecting agricultural business and rural communities in the United Kingdom," the palace announcement said.

Prince Charles is the patron of the Cambridge program, according to his website.

Prince William's active military service came to an end in September after more than seven years.

He is in the middle of a transitional year during which the Duke "is considering a number of options for public service," Kensington Palace said.
