(CNN) -- Famed boxer Manny Pacquiao prepared to square off Saturday against Juan Manuel Marquez, hoping to retain his championship and affirm his supremacy after controversy surrounded their first two bouts.

Pacquiao, who also serves as a representative in the Filipino Congress, is regarded by many as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world and has won 53 of his 58 career fights.

Marquez, though, insists he should have been declared the winner in their two clashes to date.

The two look to settle the score Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.

The Filipino entered the bout having won 10 titles at eight different weight divisions in his glittering career, from flyweight (for boxers between 108 and 112 pounds) up to super welterweight (148 to 154 pounds).

The Ring magazine, among other publications, ranks Pacquiao as the world's best pound-for-pound boxer.

That said, there's some doubt about his supremacy over Marquez. The first bout in 2004 was scored as a draw, while Pacquiao won a split decision in the rematch four years later.

The Mexican has been seen sporting a T-shirt that says "Marquez beat Pacquiao twice!!" and claims he will put the record straight when they step into the ring for the third time.

"Everyone, including many of my countrymen, believe he (Pacquiao) really won those fights," Marquez said through an interpreter.

Pacquiao though, said prior to Saturday's contest that the third chapter will resolve the debate once and for all.

"He kept on saying he got robbed in the first two fights. This fight will answer all the doubts and all the questions," he said at a news conference in Las Vegas.

If Pacquiao defeats Marquez, the next big fight for the General Santos City native could be a long awaited showdown with Floyd Mayweather Jr., the other superstar of his boxing generation.
