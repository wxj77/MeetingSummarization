(CNN) -- Mexican authorities said Friday that they have not arrested the son of drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, contrary to what they had said a day earlier.

The nation's navy announced Thursday that it had arrested Alfredo Guzman Salazar in western Mexico.

A day later, after doing more identification tests, it said it had not arrested Guzman's son.

El Chapo, who oversees the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel, is considered the most wanted man in Mexico.

In 2009, Guzman Salazar was indicted in Illinois, together with his father, on various drug trafficking charges.
