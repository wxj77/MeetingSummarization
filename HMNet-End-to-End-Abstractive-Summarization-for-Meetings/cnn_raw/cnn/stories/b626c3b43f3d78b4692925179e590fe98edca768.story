(CNN) -- Oklahoma City Thunder guard DeAndre Liggins was in jail early Sunday morning on charges of domestic abuse.

Liggins, 25, was booked into the Oklahoma County jail Saturday night where he's being held on an $8,000 bond.

According to jail records, authorities charged Liggins with domestic abuse in the presence of a minor child -- a felony.

No additional details were immediately available. But police told CNN affiliate KOCO, that the victim is believed to be Liggins' girlfriend.

In a statement to NewsOK.com, the team said it was aware of the arrest.

"We are aware of the situation and take this matter seriously," the statement read. "We are in the process of gathering more information and have no further comment at this time."

Liggins was signed by the Thunder last year after playing his rookie season with the Orlando Magic. He has averaged 1.6 points and 7.2 minutes a game for his career, and has been used almost exclusively as a substitute.
