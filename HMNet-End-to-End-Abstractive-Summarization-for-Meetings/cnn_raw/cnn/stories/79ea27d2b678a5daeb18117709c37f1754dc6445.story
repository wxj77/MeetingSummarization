(CNN) -- Denmark and the Czech Republic drew 0-0 in their opening World Cup Group B match at the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen on Saturday.

The home side created a number of chances but couldn't capitalize on their dominance and missed suspended striker Nicklas Bendtner -- who is serving a one-match ban for revealing branded underpants during a goal celebration against Portugal at Euro2012.

Michael Krohn-Dehli shot wide and Dennis Rommedahl headed wide in the first half while Christian Eriksen went close with a free kick in the second half.

Winners and losers in the transfer window

Denmark were unlucky not to be awarded a penalty when defender Daniel Wass was brought down in the penalty box, but German referee Wolfgang Stark rejecting their appeals.

Armenia currently top Group B after they beat Malta 1-0 on Friday with Bulgaria and Italy lying second and third respectively after they drew 2-2 in Sofia.

Earlier, Scotland started their World Cup qualifying campaign in uninspiring fashion, also being held to a goalless draw against Serbia at Hampden Park.

The result leaves Craig Levein's team in third place with one point after the opening round of matches in Group A. Serbia are fourth.

The Scots host FYR Macedonia -- who lost to 1-0 to Croatia in their opening tie -- next Tuesday, while Serbia return home to Novi Sad where they will play Wales, who lost 2-0 to current group leaders Belgium in their opening match.
