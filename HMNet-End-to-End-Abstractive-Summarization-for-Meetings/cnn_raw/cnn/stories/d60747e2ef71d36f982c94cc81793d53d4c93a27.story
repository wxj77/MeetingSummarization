(CNN) -- When opposition rugby teams line up against the New Zealand All Blacks, there's a common game plan: Get Carter.

New Zealand rugby player Dan Carter is on course to be the country's top points scorer.

Playing as number 10 in the fly half position, Carter is the All Blacks' creative talisman and the one player that can catch the eye with his skill and control a match with his reading of the game.

He made his debut for the All Blacks in 2003 at just 21-years-old, but really burst onto the international scene in 2005 during the British Lions tour of New Zealand.

It led his opposite number, English fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, who won the World Cup with England in 2003, to call Carter the most complete player in that position, combining great natural talent with an excellent work ethic.

As well as the accolades from journalists and fellow players he also picked up the International Rugby Board's Player of the year award in 2005.

Growing up around Christchurch on New Zealand's south island, he's been an integral member of the Crusaders team since 2002 and helped to make them the most successful team in the Super 14 competition, the southern hemisphere's top club league.

Having been courted by numerous British club sides for years, he's now taking the opportunity to play on pastures new, but with French club Perpignan.

He'll be in the Catalan city for six months, and regardless of how well he does on the field, he'll set new records by becoming the best paid player in club rugby.

He's set to earn an estimated $50,000 per game, which in a sport that lags far behind football or American sports in terms of finance is big money.

Find out what he thinks about playing his club rugby abroad for the first time, his view on the All Blacks and what it's like to be a rugby-playing pin-up on Talk Asia this week.
