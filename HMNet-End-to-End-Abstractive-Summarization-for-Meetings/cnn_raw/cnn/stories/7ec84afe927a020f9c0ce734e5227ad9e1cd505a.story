(CNN)England footballer Adam Johnson has been suspended by his club Sunderland until a police investigation has been completed, the Press Association reported Monday.

Sunderland's statement made no mention of why Johnson had been arrested, but earlier on Monday, a northeast England police force confirmed a 27-year-old man was in custody "on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16," though Durham Constabulary would not confirm if the individual in question was the Sunderland player.

"He remains in police custody and is helping officers with their inquiries," added the statement, referring to the 27-year-old man.

"Sunderland AFC has confirmed that Adam Johnson has been suspended from the club, pending the outcome of a police investigation. No further comment will be made at the present time," the club told the Press Association.

English Premier League club Sunderland refused to comment when contacted by CNN over the arrest of the 27-year-old Johnson.

The last of his 12 international appearances for the senior England team was in August 2012.

He started his career with Sunderland's local rival Middlesbrough, making his debut at the age of 17, and was sold to Manchester City for a reported fee of £7 million ($10.8 million) in early 2010.

Johnson helped City to win the 2011-12 Premier League title but was bought by his hometown team Sunderland for a reported £10 million ($15.3 million) at the start of the following season.
