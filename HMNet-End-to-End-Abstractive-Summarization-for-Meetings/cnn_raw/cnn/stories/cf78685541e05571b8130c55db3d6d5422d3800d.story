(CNN) -- Mitchell Guist, a star of the reality TV show "Swamp People," died Monday in Louisiana.

He was aboard a boat near Belle River Landing in the southern part of the state when he appeared to have a seizure, said Assumption Parish Sheriff Mike Waguespack, citing an unidentified man who was with Guist.

The reality show star then fell on the boat.

The man who was with Guist towed both his boat and Guist's boat back to the landing, called 911 and performed CPR, said Waguespack.
