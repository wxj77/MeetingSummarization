SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN)  -- Two light rail transit cars collided Saturday in San Francisco, causing multiple injuries, but none appeared life-threatening, a rail system spokesman said.

Medical personnel treat the injured Saturday at West Portal Station, where a light rail car hit another.

"Apparently the conductor for one of the trains miscalculated a turn. It's still under investigation right now," a police officer told CNN. He would not provide his name.

At least 44 people were injured, a fire official said.

None of the injuries was extremely serious, said Leslie Dubbin, administrator for operations at San Francisco General Hospital.

"There were no fatalities and everybody looks good."

The cars are part of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, commonly called Muni.

Initial reports indicated a one-car train traveling at low speed collided with a stopped one-car train, Muni spokesman Judson True said in a written statement. The accident occurred on the outbound platform of West Portal Station, he said.

As of 2:57 p.m. (5:57 p.m. ET), all Muni Metro light rail service that travels through West Portal Station in either direction was halted, he said.  Watch scenes from the collision site Â»

"There are reportedly multiple injuries as a result of the collision, but none of the injuries have yet been described as life-threatening," Judson said.

Shuttle buses were providing substitute service between West Portal and Castro stations and West Portal Station and western destinations for the K/T, L and M Muni Metro lines.

There was no estimated time for the resumption of normal Muni service.
