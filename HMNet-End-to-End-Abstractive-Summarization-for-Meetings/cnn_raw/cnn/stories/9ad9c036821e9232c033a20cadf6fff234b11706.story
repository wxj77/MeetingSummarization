(EW.com) -- Another 2013 movie is on hold.

George Clooney told the Los Angeles Times Tuesday that his World War II drama "The Monuments Men" would not meet its scheduled December 18 opening and will instead hit theaters in early 2014.

A representative from Sony Pictures, who is distributing the film, confirmed the news to EW and stated that the film would be released sometime in the first quarter of 2014, but no release date has been set.

George Clooney talks 'The Monuments Men'

"We just didn't have enough time," Clooney told the paper.

The movie, which Clooney directed, produced, and stars in, boasts an all-star cast including Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman and Cate Blanchett and was considered an awards hopeful. According to the report, when Clooney arrived in London to work with composer Alexandre Desplat on the score, he and producing partner Grant Heslov realized they were in trouble.

"If any of the effects looked cheesy, the whole movie would look cheesy," Clooney told the Times. "We simply don't have enough people to work enough hours to finish it." He added: "All we've ever said, from the very beginning, is that we wanted to make a commercial, non-cynical piece of entertainment."

"The Monuments Men" isn't the first film to drop out of the late 2013 release schedule â€” others have included Sony's "Foxcatcher" and The Weinstein Company's "Grace of Monaco," both of which have been pushed to early 2014 as well.
