(CNN) -- A powerful magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck off the coast of El Salvador late Sunday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported

The epicenter of the quake was about 177 kilometers (110 miles) southeast of the capital, San Salvador, and took place nearly 33 miles underground.

Some minor shaking was reported. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.

A tsunami warning was issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center for El Salvador and the neighboring countries of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Panama and Mexico.

A small wave caused by the quake was recorded at Acajutla, El Salvador, measuring about 10 centimeters (4 inches).

El Salvador is on the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

CNN's Jessica King, Merlin Delcid and Norman Powell contributed to this report.
