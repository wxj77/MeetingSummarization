(CNN) -- England and Sri Lanka drew their third and final Test at the Rose Bowl on Monday, a result that saw hosts England take a 1-0 series victory.

A century from Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara, the 25th of his career, ensured the tourists escaped defeat in a match that saw 155 overs lost due to bad weather in its first three days.

A final downpor during the tea interval prevented any further play, with Sri Lanka on 334 for five in their second innings -- having lost just two wickets on the final day.

This meant Sri Lanka had a lead of 141, in reply to England's first innings total of 377 for eight declared.

England won the first Test in Cardiff by an innings and 114 runs before a draw in the second Test at Lord's, and Sangakkara -- who made 119 -- told reporters his side were ultimately made to pay for collapsing to 82 all out inside 25 overs in that first Test match.

"None of us were really switched on for Cardiff, we could have had a 0-0 Test series if we were," said Sangakkara.

"There is a lot of regret but lessons were learned. There were various situations that could have played out today but we batted with our heads held high and walked away with a good result."

England captain Andrew Strauss added: "We got ourselves in a position to go on and win the game but fair play to Sangakkara, the Sri Lankans blunted our attack -- we didn't make the inroads we needed to make."

"I think we got ourselves into good positions in all three Test matches and in a way that two-hour session in Cardiff was good enough to get us one result."

England remain third in the ICC Test rankings behind leaders India, their next Test opponents, and South Africa.
