Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- An Aruban magistrate ruled Wednesday that a Maryland man, detained in connection with the disappearance of an American woman, will remain in custody for another 60 days.

A detainment hearing was held Wednesday morning for Gary Giordano, 50. Giordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner, 35, also of Maryland, was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island.

The magistrate's brief order did not elaborate on the decision beyond saying the suspect, identified by his initials of G.V.G., was "suspected of involvement in the possible drowning of the American woman," and that the custody extension "was done on request of the Prosecutor's Office."

On August 15, a judge ruled that there was enough evidence to keep Giordano detained for another 16 days as police continued to investigate the death.

The missing woman and the suspect arrived on the island July 31 from the United States, according to Aruban prosecutors.

Giordano, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, told authorities that he was snorkeling with Gardner and signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, he allegedly said.

According to a transcript of a police interview, obtained by CNN, Giordano told police that he feared for his life when he signaled for Gardner to turn back and didn't look for her as he swam for shore.

"I only looked back when I hit a rock," the document quotes Giordano as telling investigators. "Before that, I did not look back. I was only busy saving my life."

Gardner has not been found, although search efforts are ongoing.

Giordano also told authorities that he is the beneficiary of a $1.5 million accidental death insurance policy tied to Gardner, a local official told CNN.
