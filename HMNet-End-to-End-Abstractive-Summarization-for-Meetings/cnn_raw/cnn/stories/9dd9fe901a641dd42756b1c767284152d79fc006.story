New York (CNN) -- Whew!! Something stinks! But before you run to take out the trash, check the stack of mail you just carried inside.

A few thousand New York household received an odoriferous gift in the mail from Carl Paladino, the Republican nominee for governor - and it doesn't smell like roses.

Paladino's campaign mailed out garbage-scented fliers declaring "Something Stinks in Albany" and featuring photos of seven New York Democrats whose political careers were marred by scandal.

"It's basically a folder and then when you open it, when the oxygen hits the card the stink starts," Paladino explained to Anderson Cooper on "AC360" Thursday night.

"The longer you keep it open the worse the stink gets. That's our analogy of Albany," he added.

Paladino claims no one has complained about the pungent mailings and they have been well received.
