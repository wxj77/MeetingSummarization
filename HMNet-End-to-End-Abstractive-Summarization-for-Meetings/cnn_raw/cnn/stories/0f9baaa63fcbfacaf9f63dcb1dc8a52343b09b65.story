(CNN) -- Roll out the red carpet: America's favorite prima donna pig is on the way to the Smithsonian.

Miss Piggy, the beloved Muppet character known for flaunting her fashion sense and karate-chopping her way out of trouble, will go on display in March, the National Museum of American History said Tuesday.

She won't be alone. Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy's longtime love interest, is already at the museum.

Miss Piggy was among more than 20 puppets and props donated Tuesday by the family of famed Muppets creator Jim Henson.

Other characters donated included the Swedish Chef from "The Muppet Show," Cookie Monster, Elmo, Bert and Ernie from "Sesame Street," and Red Fraggle and Traveling Matt from "Fraggle Rock."

"We don't want these puppets in boxes," daughter Cheryl Henson said at a ceremony announcing the donation, according to the Smithsonian.

Jim Henson, who died in 1990, would have turned 77 on Tuesday.

"No American artist has appealed to and affected as many people in different age groups and cultures the way Jim Henson has," said John Gray, director of the museum.

CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.
