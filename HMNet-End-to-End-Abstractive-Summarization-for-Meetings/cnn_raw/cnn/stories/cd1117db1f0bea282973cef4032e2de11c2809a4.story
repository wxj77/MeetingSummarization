NEW YORK (CNN) -- Paul McCartney has come to New York and he wants to shout it from the rooftops.

Paul McCartney performs Wednesday on the roof above the marquee of New York's Ed Sullivan Theater.

To promote his concert at Citi Field this Friday, the former Beatle performed Wednesday afternoon on the roof above the Ed Sullivan Theater marquee before his appearance on "Late Night with David Letterman," which is taped in the theater.

Wednesday's performance began at 5:30 p.m. ET and included a set of classics including "Get Back," "Band on the Run," "Helter Skelter" and "Back in the USSR." Sporting a pink button-up shirt and suspenders, McCartney played to a huge crowd that blocked off traffic near the intersection of 53rd Street and Broadway.

McCartney occasionally waved to occupants of nearby buildings as they gathered at their windows to listen to the concert.

McCartney will be the first music act to play at Citi Field, and that concert will kick off his summer U.S. tour. The Ed Sullivan Theater, named for the late variety-show host, has special meaning for McCartney as it was the site of the Beatles' historic televised performance in 1964.
