(CNN) -- She just can't seem to stay away.

A day after she pleaded no contest to stowing away, Marilyn Jean Hartman was re-arrested at the Los Angeles airport on Thursday.

She was seen earlier in the day arriving at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), where she spent about an hour "scouting out multiple passenger terminals before being arrested.

"Airport Police officers did not observe Hartman attempting to purchase an airline ticket and she did not have a ticket or boarding pass in her possession when arrested," the airport said in a statement.

Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said in the statement that flyers were distributed with Hartman's picture on it.

"When we knew she was going to be released from custody, we were prepared," he said.

This week, authorities say Hartman, 62, made it through a screening checkpoint at Mineta San Jose International Airport without a ticket and boarded a Southwest Airlines flight bound for LAX. She was initially arrested there Monday.

She pleaded no contest Wednesday to a misdemeanor count of stowing away, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. She was sentenced to two years probation and three days in jail. She was given credit for time served and released.

Outside the courthouse, Hartman refused to detail to reporters how she got through security.

"I don't think it's wise to say how I got through. I don't want to help the enemy," she said.

"...I want to go with a paid ticket. ... I want to do everything legal," Hartman said then. "It was clearly wrong on my part. ... It was stupid and it is something I don't want to repeat."

Hartman has been described by authorities as a serial stowaway, who has repeatedly tried to board flights to Hawaii at San Francisco International Airport without a ticket.

Earlier this year, she was sentenced to probation and ordered to stay away from the San Francisco airport.
