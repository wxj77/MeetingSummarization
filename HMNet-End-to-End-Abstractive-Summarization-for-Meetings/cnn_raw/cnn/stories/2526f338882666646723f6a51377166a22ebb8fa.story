(CNN) -- An electrical outage at a power station in northern New Jersey left 20,000 households -- and a major airport -- without power Monday, prompting authorities to restrict incoming and outgoing flights at Newark International Airport, officials said.

Several people were removed from stalled elevators, while others were stranded in the airport's monorail trains, according to a spokesman for the Port Authority for New York and New Jersey.

The outage occurred around 2:30 p.m. after an equipment failure at Bayway Switching Station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, according to Public Service Electric and Gas Co. spokeswoman Bonnie Sheppard.

Power was restored at Newark airport around 4 p.m., and flights resumed with minor delays.

Emergency crews were working to restore service across the region, Sheppard said.
