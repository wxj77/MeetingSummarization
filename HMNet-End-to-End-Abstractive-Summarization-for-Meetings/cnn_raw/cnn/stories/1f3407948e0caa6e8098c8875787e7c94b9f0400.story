LONDON, England (CNN) -- Former Beatle Ringo Starr has given his fans a ticket to ride.

Former Beatle Ringo Starr says he has had enough of signing fan mail and memorabilia.

In a video posted on his Web site, Starr says he will no longer sign fan mail or memorabilia.

"I want to tell you please... do not send fan mail to any address that you have. Nothing will be signed after the 20th of October. If that is the date on the envelope, it's gonna be tossed.

"I'm warning you with peace and love I have too much to do. So no more fan mail, thank you, thank you, and no objects to be signed. Nothing," the 68-year-old said.

The drummer, wearing dark glasses, said it was "a serious message to everybody watching."  Watch Ringo's rant Â»

Starr once starred in an episode of 'The Simpsons' which showed him answering every piece of fan mail.

"They took the time to write to me, and I don't care if it takes 20 years, I'm going to answer every one of them," Starr said on the show.

Starr, who earlier this year released a new album called Liverpool 8, divides his time between homes in Los Angeles, the South of France and Surrey.

He angered Liverpool residents during an interview on British television in January when he said he missed nothing about the city.
