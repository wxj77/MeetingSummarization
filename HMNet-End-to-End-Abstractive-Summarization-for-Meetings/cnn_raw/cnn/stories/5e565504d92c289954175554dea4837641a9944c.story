(CNN) -- Serie A leaders AC Milan remain on course for a domestic double after reaching the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup with a 3-0 home win over Bari.

Milan, with Antonio Cassano making his debut for the club, were always in control at the San Siro, and they now travel to Cassano's former club Sampdoria -- with a place in the semifinals up for grabs.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic continued his impressive recent form by opening the scoring for the home side in the 19th minute.

And there was no way back for Bari once young German midfielder Alexander Merkel had doubled Milan's advantage on the stroke of halftime.

Man-of-the-match Robinho made the opening two goals before deservedly getting on the scoresheet himself midway through the second half, converting a pass from Merkel.

The other quarterfinal ties will see Napoli entertain holders Inter Milan, Juventus play host to Roma and Palermo facing Parma.
