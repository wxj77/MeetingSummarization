President Barack Obama visited Monday with the family of TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez, who was killed at Los Angeles International Airport earlier this month.

The President also met with Tony Grigsby and James Speer -- two other TSA officers who were wounded in the November 1 shooting incident.

A gunman stormed a terminal at the airport on November 1, killing Hernandez and injuring several others.

Hernandez is the first TSA officer to die in the line of duty.

Officers shot suspect Paul Ciancia multiple times during the assault.

He was hospitalized briefly, but is out and in the custody of U.S. marshals.

Ciancia has been charged with the murder of a federal officer and commission of violence at an international airport.
