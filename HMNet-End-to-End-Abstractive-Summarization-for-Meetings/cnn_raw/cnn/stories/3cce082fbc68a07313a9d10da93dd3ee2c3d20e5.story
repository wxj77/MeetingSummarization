A 90-year-old former Nazi lost a crucial legal battle to stay in the United States when a federal appeals court unanimously rejected his appeal.

John (Ivan) Kalymon sought to overturn a lower court ruling that ordered him removed from the country. His lawyers still have a long-shot chance to win a rehearing or a Supreme Court hearing, but government sources said officials think Kalymon's hopes of remaining in the United States are slim.

Kalymon, a resident of Michigan,  was ordered removed by a Detroit judge in January, 2011. The court found that as a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police in German-occupied Lviv, Ukraine, he had rounded up and shot Jews. He served voluntarily as an armed member of a pro-Nazi police unit, U.S. officials said.

A U.S. government source said the biggest problem the United States faces is finding a European country willing to take Kalymon. U.S. sources confirmed European newspaper accounts that Kalymon is under investigation by a unit of the German police, which could eventually lead to him being taken into German custody.

The number of aging former Nazis being prosecuted by the United States is dwindling. Kalymon is one of only four remaining targets of Justice Department Nazi hunters. More than 100 former Nazis have been prosecuted by the Justice Department since it established the Office of Special Investigations in 1979.
