Los Angeles (CNN) -- Music legend and convicted killer Phil Spector's latest prison mugshots show both a happy and a sad face.

The California Department of Corrections released two previously unseen photos of Spector, who has been in prison for more than five years with another 14 to go. Spector, who is being held at California Health Care Facility in Stockton, is eligible for parole consideration when he turns 88.

Spector, 74, was convicted of second-degree murder in the 2003 shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson.

He's wearing a broad smile in a mugshot taken July 24, 2013, while another taken on October 28, 2013 captures an apparently sullen Spector. Both photos suggest each date was a bad hair day for the inmate.

He has not been allowed access to his infamous collection of curly wigs since he was handcuffed and locked up after his May 2009 conviction. Corrections officials said at the time that wigs are banned because they could be used to hide contraband.

Spector's "wall of sound" approach to record production -- the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- changed the music world in the 1960s.
