(CNN) -- Four people, including three children, were found dead inside a home in a peaceful, family-oriented northwest Florida neighborhood Saturday, police said.

A Florida medical examiner is working to determine exactly what caused the death of the adult and three children, who are believed to be two 6-year-olds and a 3-year-old toddler, Tallahassee police spokesman David McCranie said.

Police have launched a homicide investigation, given the condition of the dead.

"There's obvious violence in the home," said McCranie. "How that violence transpired, we're not sure."

Investigators have talked with neighbors, friends and relatives of the dead, who were found in a single-family residence.

McCranie said that police are not yet identifying the relationship between the dead.

"I really don't believe it, that I'm not going to see those little girls running around, up and down the street anymore," neighbor Darius Mount told CNN Tallahassee affiliate WCTV.

McCranie said police found the bodies in a home in a "typical suburban Tallahassee neighborhood." The subdivision, "no more than one to two square miles" in size, he said, was built within the last five years.

"There are a lot of kids, and it's quiet, peaceful," McCranie said.

As of early Saturday evening, there were no official suspects in what McCranie called an "active, ongoing investigation." He said that authorities hope to have more information Sunday about the investigation.

"Right now, it's putting all the pieces of the puzzle together," McCranie said.
