(CNN) -- European Ryder Cup teammates Lee Westwood and Justin Rose will play off for the World Golf Finals title after both Britons won their last-four ties on Thursday.

World No. 5 Rose edged 14-time major winner Tiger Woods to reach Friday's final of the unsanctioned knockout tournament in Istanbul, Turkey.

Earlier on Thursday Woods had inflicted a crushing six-stroke victory over out-of-sorts world No. 1 Rory McIlroy at the Antalya Golf Club in their group stage match.

Northern Irishman McIlroy struggled all week at the eight-man event, losing all three of his matches.

"I'm not that disappointed because I've got the afternoon off around the pool," quipped McIlroy as reported by British newspaper The Guardian. "I just came here because I have never played in Turkey and there is a lot of good players here.

"I thought it would be a fun week and it has been. So I've enjoyed myself. I feel fine and the energy levels are OK and I've got another week off next week before I get myself up for the Race to Dubai."

With McIlroy and Woods out of the picture, Westwood and Rose will contest the $5.2 million competition.

Westwood reached the final courtesy of a dazzling 10-under-par round of 61 to defeat South African 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel.

Former world No. 1 Westwood could have carded an even more impressive score had he not double-bogeyed the fourth, but he was still able to wrap up a comfortable six-stroke success.

The final will take place on Friday, with a Pro-Am tournament later in the day bringing the event to a close.
