Los Angeles (CNN) -- "Easy Rider" actor Peter Fonda found a body while driving down Sunset Boulevard in the Pacific Palisades community of west Los Angeles on Wednesday, police said.

Fonda, 70, noticed that a car had been parked on side street off Sunset Boulevard for two days, so he stopped to check it out, according to Los Angeles Police Homicide Detective Allen Shubert.

"He looked in the vehicle and saw a body in there and called the fire department," Shubert said.

A man who had committed suicide several days before was slumped over the wheel of the sedan, he said.

The man's identity has not been made public, but he was not a celebrity, he said.
