Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Five people were killed and 10 were wounded Friday by a car bombing near a peacekeeper convoy in the Somali capital, officials said.

All of those killed or injured were Somali civilians, according to Abdikafi Hilowle, administration secretary for the Benadir region.

The blast happened as a convoy of African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM, personnel passed a United Nations Development Program compound in Mogadishu, Hilowle said.

This is the latest in a series of attacks in the city, the heart of an unstable nation beset with civil strife. Government and African Union forces have been battling Islamic militants for years in an effort to bring stability to the land.

Last month, more than a dozen people were killed in an attack on the U.N. headquarters in Mogadishu.

Friday's attack appeared to be aimed at the convoy, AMISOM spokesman Col. Ali Aden Houmed said, adding that the incident is under investigation.

The African Union Mission in Somalia is an African Union-operated peacekeeping group.
