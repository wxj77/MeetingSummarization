He'll play a member of a small mobile group of agents called the Red Team, who are forced to live and work together as they crisscross the country solving crimes.

Corbett's character is Roy Quaid, a former NCIS Special Agent forced to retire from active service, Roy now works as an Analyst. While no longer an active agent, Roy is the most experienced investigator working for Red Team, a fact that's not lost on any of the other agents.

The pilot episode will air as a special "NCIS: LA" episode later this season (yes, it's a spinoff of a spinoff!).

Corbett's breakout role was on another CBS hit series, 1990â€²s "Northern Exposure," and he recently had an arc on NBC's "Parenthood." He also starred in the 2003 FX series "Lucky."

If greenlit to series, this could practically give Corbett a TV gig for life given the durability of the hit franchise (but no pressure!).
