Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court has indicted six soldiers and one civilian on murder and terrorism charges in the death of an unarmed man whose fatal shooting was caught on video.

The seven men pleaded not guilty, said Muhammad Khan, a public prosecutor in a special anti-terrorism court in the southern city of Karachi.

Teenager Sarfraz Shah was shot and killed by Rangers providing security at a public park this month.

A chilling video of the incident was played repeatedly on national television and became the latest in a series of human rights violations that horrified Pakistanis and eroded public confidence in security agencies.

In the video, an unarmed Shah begs not to be shot. He pleads with the men carrying automatic rifles. "I am helpless," he cries. "Please do not fire."

Then, two shots and screams of pain. Blood streams out onto the ground beneath him.

The Rangers are Pakistan's paramilitary force primarily responsible for border protection, but at the request of provinces, it helps to maintain law and order in cities.

Karachi police said Shah tried to rob people at a park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by pointing a pistol and trying to steal cash and cell phones. He was handed over to park security and then to the Rangers.

A hearing on the case begins Thursday.
