As Rep. Bill Cassidy wages a runoff campaign against Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, he'll get some in-person support this weekend from Sarah Palin and  "Duck Dynasty" star Phil Robertson.

Palin previously endorsed Cassidy's GOP primary opponent Rob Maness, but now that the race has narrowed to a contest between Cassidy and Landrieu, Palin will help shore up the GOP vote for Cassidy.

Palin and Robertson will attend a GOP unity rally for Cassidy on Saturday afternoon in Monroe, Cassidy's spokesman confirmed. The story was first reported by Politico.

It's not the first time Palin has palled around with the "Duck Dynasty" clan. Last year she spent time with the family in Monroe while she was on a book tour.

In Louisiana's jungle primary system, Landrieu won roughly 42% of the vote, while Cassidy took 41% and Maness took 14%. According to state law, if no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, the top two contenders--regardless of party-automatically go into a December runoff.
