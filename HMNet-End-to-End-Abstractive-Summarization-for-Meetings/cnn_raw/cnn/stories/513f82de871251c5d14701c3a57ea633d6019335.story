(CNN) -- Crews in Taiwan have found body parts as the search unfolds for victims of rock slides unleashed by Typhoon Megi last week, official media said.

Four sets of body parts have been found, with DNA testing to be done, Taiwan's official Central News Agency said.

Nineteen tourists from southern China, a Chinese tour group leader and a Taiwanese bus driver went missing Thursday along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan. Sections of the scenic highway, which is perched along a cliff on the island's eastern coast, gave way.

Three dozen family members of the missing Chinese tourists arrived in Taiwan on Monday night. They were to visit the site of the rock slides on Tuesday, China's state media said.

Megi killed at least 13 people and injured nearly 100 others in Taiwan last week. It struck the Philippines earlier in the week, affecting an estimated 258,844 people and leaving thousands homeless.

Typhoon Megi made landfall in China's southeastern province of Fujian on Saturday, affecting nearly 650,000 people and destroying 500 houses, China's Xinhua news agency said. About 270,000 people had evacuated.

Damage in Fujian from the strongest typhoon of the year was estimated at 1.59 billion yuan ($238 million).

No deaths or significant injuries were reported, thanks to rigorous typhoon precautions in Fujian, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, the state-run China Daily said.
