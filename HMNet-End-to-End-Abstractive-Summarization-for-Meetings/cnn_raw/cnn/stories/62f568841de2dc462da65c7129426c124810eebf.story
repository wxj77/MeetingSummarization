(CNN) -- New York City's former mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has a new job.

The billionaire media mogul has been appointed special envoy for cities and climate change, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Friday.

"He's starting right away and he'll be pushing for action in the cities and raising the profile of cities," said U.N. Public Information Officer Dan Shepard.

For his efforts, Bloomberg will be paid $1 per year, Shepard said in a telephone interview.

Bloomberg will assist Ban in consultations with mayors and others "to raise political will and mobilize action among cities as part of his long-term strategy to advance efforts on climate change," he added in a statement.

Those efforts include bringing solutions to the climate summit Ban is hosting in September in New York.

Ban "has invited leaders from governments, businesses, finance and civil society organizations to bring bold announcements and actions to the 2014 Climate Summit to raise the level of ambition through new and more robust action on climate change," it said. "Cities play an essential role in developing and implementing actions and driving ambition, translating to significant impacts on climate change."

Bloomberg served as New York's mayor from 2002 to 2013. In 1981, he launched Bloomberg LP, a financial news and information company.

In 2007, he addressed the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bali, Indonesia.

He also serves as president of the Board of the C40 Climate Leadership Group, a network of cities "committed to implementing meaningful and sustainable climate-related actions locally that will help address climate change globally."
