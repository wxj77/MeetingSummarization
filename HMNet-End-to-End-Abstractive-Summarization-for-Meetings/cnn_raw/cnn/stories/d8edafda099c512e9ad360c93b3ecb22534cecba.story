(CNN)  -- The thumbs of two-time Formula 1 champion Fernando Alonso are now insured for 10 million euros ($13.3 million) as part of a new campaign by Spanish-based bank Santander.

Alonso's thumbs are both essential to F1 driving and "a sign of victory and that everything is under control and well-protected," the bank said in announcing the new deal.

The Ferrari ace will be starring in a series of ads for Santander's new insurance campaign, which kicked off Monday near Madrid.

Alonso is a national hero in his native Spain after claiming back-to-back Formula One world championships in 2005 and 2006 when driving for Renault.

He moved to McLaren for the 2007 season, but an intense rivalry on and off the track with teammate Lewis Hamilton led to Alonso leaving the team after one season.

After returning to Renault for a second spell, the 28-year-old moved to Ferrari for the 2010 season, joining Felipe Massa at the famous Italian team.

He led a Ferrari 1-2 at the opening round of this year's championship in Bahrain, but has been less successful in the two latest races, lying third in the title race ahead of next weekend's Spanish Grand Prix.

"We haven't always gained what we could have, according to our potential, but we're fighting for the title and this is what counts more than anything else," he told gathered reporters as his unusual insurance deal was announced.
