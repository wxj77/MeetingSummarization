(CNN Student News) -- March 10, 2014

A mystery surrounds the disappearance of a passenger plane in Southeast Asia, and we'll start off today by telling you what was unusual about the flight. We also look at some of the first wartime photographs ever taken and contrast them with current tension in the same region. Other stories include a survey of college freshmen and the outcome of a marathon spelling bee.
