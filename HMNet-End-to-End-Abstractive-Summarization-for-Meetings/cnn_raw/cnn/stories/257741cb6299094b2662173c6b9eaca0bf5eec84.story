(CNN) -- J.J. Abrams has given "Star Wars" fans something new to geek out about, and better yet, it's for a good cause.

As part of Star Wars: Force for Change, a charity campaign that supports UNICEF, the director has announced an enviable prize while coyly giving fans a glimpse of the X-wing starfighter in "Star Wars: Episode VII."

Filmed on "Episode VII's" London set, Abrams revealed that fans who contribute to Force for Change's charity drive can not only win a visit to the set and the chance to be in the movie, they will snag a private advance screening of the film.

The Force for Change campaign, which is hosted by the Omaze fundraising site, has received participation from supporters in 119 countries since it kicked off in May. The money goes to support UNICEF's Innovation Labs and programs, which work to find solutions to the problems faced by kids and families around the globe.

Any contribution made to "Star Wars: Force for Change" by Friday makes the participant eligible for prizes, including the granddaddy prize of a trip for two to the "Star Wars" set.

Action on the production is expected to stall in coming weeks as returning "Star Wars" star Harrison Ford recovers from a leg injury.

The 72-year-old actor broke his leg in an on-set accident in June, and "Star Wars: Episode VII" will take a two-week break in August as Ford heals.

The movie, which has been staffing up with a number of little-known actors, is scheduled to bow on December 18, 2015.
