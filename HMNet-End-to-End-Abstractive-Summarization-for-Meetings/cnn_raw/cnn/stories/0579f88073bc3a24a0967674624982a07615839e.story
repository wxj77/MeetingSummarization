(CNN) -- If you placed bets on Rachel McAdams and Taylor Kitsch joining the cast of "True Detective," it's time to collect your winnings.

After weeks of rumors, HBO has confirmed that McAdams, Kitsch and Kelly Reilly will also star in the second season of the network's acclaimed drama.

HBO, which shares a parent company with CNN, announced in September that Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn were going to be "True Detective's" season 2 leads.

The series, created and written by Nic Pizzolatto, follows a new story each season.

Its first season, which premiered earlier this year, focused on two detectives embroiled in a years-long hunt for a serial killer. It was an immediate hit, and at the 2014 Emmys "True Detective" picked up 12 nominations. That included two best lead actor in a drama nods for stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.

The second season still involves detective work, but this time around the story is set in California. According to HBO, this season "three police officers and a career criminal must navigate a web of conspiracy in the aftermath of a murder."

Colin Farrell plays a "compromised detective" named Ray Velcoro, "whose allegiances are torn between his masters in a corrupt police department and the mobster who owns him." Vaughn stars as a criminal and entrepreneur named Frank Semyon, who's "in danger of losing his empire when his move into legitimate enterprise is upended by the murder of a business partner."

"Sherlock Holmes" actress Kelly Reilly will play the wife of Vaughn's character, and Rachel McAdams will play a county sheriff named Ani Bezzerides, whose "uncompromising ethics put her at odds with others and the system she serves."

And lastly, "Friday Night Lights" alum Taylor Kitsch will portray a "war veteran and motorcycle officer for the California Highway Patrol, running from a difficult past and the sudden glare of a scandal that never happened."

Sounds juicy. Production on "True Detective" season 2 is already under way in California.
