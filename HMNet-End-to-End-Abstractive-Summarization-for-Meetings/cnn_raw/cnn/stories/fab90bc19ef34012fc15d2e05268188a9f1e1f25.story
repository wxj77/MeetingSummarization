(CNN) -- The death toll in the Philippines from Typhoon Megi has climbed to 11 as the powerful storm moved away from the country.

According to civil defense officials, four people died in Pangasinan province: Three were killed by a falling tree, and the fourth by lightning.

Three more died in a storm surge in Isabela province, and one person drowned while trying to cross a river in Nueva Ecija province.

Additionally, the National Disaster Risk Reduction & Management Council reported that one person drowned in the town of Cagayan, one was killed by a falling tree in Kalinga province, and one was killed by another tree in the city of Baguio.

On Tuesday, Megi carried sustained winds of about 167 kph (104 mph) off the coast of the Philippines in the South China Sea, CNN meteorologist Jennifer Delgado said. But parts of the Philippines could still be vulnerable to mudslides and landslides.

The typhoon could approach Hong Kong and mainland China in the next few days. Megi could bring heavy rain to already-drenched areas such as Hainan and Vietnam, where state media said at least 20 people have died from recent flooding.

Journalist Eduardo Lingao in Manila contributed to this report.
