(CNN)One woman is about to make the leap from YouTube star to boob tube star.

E! has announced that Grace Helbig will star in "The Grace Helbig Project," described as "a hybrid comedy show that will feature the comedienne's fresh take on what's trending in pop culture, as well as exclusive interviews with various celebrity guests."

Helbig has more than 2 million subscribers for her "It's Grace" YouTube channel, where she releases three videos a week.

Her new show will debut in April. Jeff Olde, executive vice president of original programming and development at the network, said the series is part of its expanded programming.

"This show is a fresh take on the conventional talk show with a very unconventional host who has already captured an enormous fan base of young viewers on the web," Olde said. "As we continue to seek out programming that offers a rich multiplatform experience, we are excited to launch this forward-thinking talk show that speaks so perfectly to our audience and to the core of E!'s pop culture brand."

Helbig is also the author of "Grace's Guide: The Art of Pretending to Be a Grown-up."

"Congratulations to E! for giving an Internet-obsessed introvert a talk show," she said. "I'm looking forward to working with humans."
