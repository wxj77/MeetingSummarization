(CNN) -- The LA Lakers will play in Europe for the first time in 19 years, when they take part in NBA Europe Live 2010 alongside the Minnesota Timberwolves and the New York Knicks.

The tour will see the Lakers, the reigning NBA champions, and the Timberwolves go head-to-head at the O2 in London on October 4, the night after the Knicks open the tour in Milan against Euroleague team Armani Jeans Milano.

This year's event offers Europe's basketball fans a rare chance to see one of the NBA's biggest stars, LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant.

The 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player is excited by the prospect of playing outside of U.S and in particular is looking forward to playing in front of an enthusiastic crowd in London.

"I know how passionate the fans are in the UK," said Bryant told the Daily Express newspaper. "I look forward to putting on a show for what promises to be a great game."

The Knicks and the Timberwolves will face-off in Paris on October 6, before the Lakers complete the 2010 tour by taking on another Euroleague team, Regal FC Barcelona, in the Catalan city on October 7.
