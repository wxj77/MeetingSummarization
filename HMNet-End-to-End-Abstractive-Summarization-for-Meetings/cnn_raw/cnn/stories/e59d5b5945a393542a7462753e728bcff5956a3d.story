(CNN) -- Rapper Young Jeezy allegedly beat up his teenage son and threatened to kill him during an argument 15 months ago.

Jeezy -- whose real name is Jay Wayne Jenkins -- was released on a $45,000 bond on Friday, hours after turning himself into the jail on a grand jury warrant, Fulton County, Georgia, sheriff's spokesman Tracy Flanagan said.

The 36-year-old artist is set to appear in an Atlanta court on January 29 on felony charges of battery, terroristic threats and false imprisonment, Flanagan said.

His son told police the alleged incident at this Atlanta apartment in September 2012 "stemmed from a text message he sent to his father."

His father "walked into the bathroom where he was and slammed his head against the sliding shower door," then "picked him up and threw him into the wall in the bedroom," the police report said.

When the teen tried to run downstairs and away, he was blocked by his father's bodyguard, the report said.

Jeezy then "pulled him back into the room, threw him on the bed, choked him and stated 'I'll kill you," the son told police. He then allegedly threw him against a wall and onto the floor before kicking him in the head.

"The juvenile stated his father stated to him 'I'll put a bullet in your head right now,'" the report said.

The boy's mother called police two days later when her son returned to her and she noticed bruising and scratches on his face," the police report said.

CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.
