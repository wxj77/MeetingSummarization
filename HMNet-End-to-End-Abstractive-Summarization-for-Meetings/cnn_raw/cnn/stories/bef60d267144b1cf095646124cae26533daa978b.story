(CNN) -- West Indies cricket coach John Dyson has been dismissed from his job with immediate effect.

Australian John Dyson had been in charge of the West Indies cricket side since 2007.

The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) said they were terminating the contract of the Australian, according to a statement on the cricket board's Web site.

The decision comes after recent Test and one-day series losses to Bangladesh, although in both defeats the West Indies were forced to put out weakened sides because of a dispute between players and the cricket board over contracts.

Dyson, a former opening batsman who played 30 Tests for Australia, took charge of the West Indies in 2007.

He enjoyed early Test series wins over South Africa and England but was heavily criticized for misreading the rain regulations in a one-day event with England in Guyana in March, an error that ultimately handed England the series.

Earlier in his career he was appointed Sri Lanka coach in 2003 despite having only limited coaching experience at higher levels.

The 55-year-old was due to lead the West Indies into next month's International Cricket Council Champions Trophy.

The WICB offered no reason for Dyson's sacking but in a statement on their Web site confirmed that the assistant coach David Williams would take over as coach on a temporary basis for the upcoming tournament, which gets started in South Africa on September 22.

The contract dispute means the West Indies will be forced to take a second-string side to South Africa.

The statement added that "in view of the special circumstances pertaining to this tour" the former West Indies vice-captain and off-spin bowler Lance Gibbs had been appointed team manager.
