(CNN) -- Amid the back-and-forth about the cast of the new "Star Wars" movie, one voice has cut through the fray: Luke Skywalker's.

That's Mark Hamill, for some of you.

The actor tweeted his support of the recently announced "Star Wars: Episode VII" team on Thursday, calling his new and returning castmates a varied and impressive group.

"I was knocked out by the diverse & extraordinarily talented new cast members," Hamill said of a UK table read. "WOW they're good! The saga is in superb hands."

On Tuesday, Disney and Lucasfilm made an official announcement of who's joined "Star Wars: Episode VII," revealing that original "Star Wars" actors will appear in the film along with a number of newcomers. Along with Hamill, "Star Wars" veterans Harrison Ford, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Carrie Fisher are all reprising their former roles.

They'll be joined by "Inside Llewyn Davis'" Oscar Isaac, "Attack the Block's" John Boyega, "Girls" actor Adam Driver and newcomer Daisy Ridley, among others.

Character descriptions haven't been offered, but with Hamill's endorsement, perhaps the Force can remain undisturbed.

Although Fisher momentarily confused "Episode VII" with "Chapter VII," she got it right long enough to give her own vote of confidence for the upcoming film. "May the Episode 7 be with you always," she tweeted to her fans April 30.

"Star Wars: Episode VII," which will be directed by J.J. Abrams, arrives December 18, 2015.
