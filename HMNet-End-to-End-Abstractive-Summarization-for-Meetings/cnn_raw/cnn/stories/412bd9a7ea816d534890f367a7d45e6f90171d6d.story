Atlanta (CNN) -- The agent for NFL star Hines Ward, arrested on a driving under the influence of alcohol charge in Georgia, said Saturday he is confident that the facts will show his client was not impaired.

Ward, a 35-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver, was released after posting a $1,000 bond, according to a jail record in DeKalb County.

"(Ward) cooperated fully with the police and truthfully answered all of their questions," agent and manager Andrew Ree said.

"We are currently in the process of ascertaining all the facts," Ree continued in a statement. "From our preliminary investigation we can tell you that we are confident that the facts will show that Hines was not impaired by alcohol while driving. However, Hines is deeply saddened by this incident and apologizes to his fans and the Steelers organization for this distraction."

Ward also is known for winning the latest season of ABC's "Dancing with the Stars."

He has two Super Bowl rings, was the most valuable player in Super Bowl XL and was selected four times for the NFL Pro Bowl.

Ward was born in South Korea and grew up in Georgia. His Helping Hands U.S. Foundation focuses on improving literacy among children, according to his website. He also has a foundation in South Korea targeting discrimination against biracial children.

Friday, Hines posted items on his Facebook page about his habit of texting while driving.
