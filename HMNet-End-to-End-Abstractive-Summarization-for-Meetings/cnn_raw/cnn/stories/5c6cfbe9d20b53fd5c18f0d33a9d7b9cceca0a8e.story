(EW.com) -- Lifetime will put John Walsh back to work: The network announced today that it has picked up "America's Most Wanted."

The show that began its run on the Fox owned and operated stations and then moved to the network will return for its 25th season later this year on Lifetime. (In May, Fox canceled the show as a weekly Saturday series because the show was no longer profitable but it will still air quarterly specials -- the first of which will bow in October.)

"I've always believed there was something very special about "America's Most Wanted" and that there should be a home for it on television, and I couldn't be happier to now be able bring it back on Lifetime," said Walsh in a statement. "We've often been called the court of last resort ... now we are back in the game and ready to saddle up for another season to get justice for victims and put dangerous criminals behind bars."

Hosted and executive produced by Walsh, "America's Most Wanted" has helped to capture more than 1,100 fugitives in the U.S. and 30 countries, including 17 on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. Last season, the show averaged 5 million viewers on Fox and a 1.7 rating in the adult demo.
