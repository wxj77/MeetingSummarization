(CNN) -- CNN-sponsored Team Lotus have drafted in Karun Chandhok to replace Jarno Trulli for Sunday's German Grand Prix.

Chandhok, 27,  joined Team Lotus team as a reserve driver in March and has not taken part in a race since representing Hispania at the 2010 British Grand Prix.

Trulli, 37, is currently in his second season with Team Lotus, but the veteran Italian, who has also raced for Jordan and Renault during a 14-year career, has failed to score a point in 28 races with the marquee.

"Ever since I first joined the team I have been looking forward to this opportunity and I am determined to do my best to repay their faith in me and help the team progress," India's Chandhok said in a statement Thursday.

"I know there will be millions of Indian fans, and Team Lotus fans around the world, who will be behind me and the whole team, so I will do the best I can to give them something to cheer for."

Chandhok also received the backing of one-time grand prix winner Trulli, who vowed to help his teammate in the build up to the Nurburgring event.

"I'm looking forward to working with Karun this weekend and doing whatever I can to help him get the most out of his opportunity in Germany," said Trulli.

"It's great that the team is true to its word of helping develop young talent, particularly from parts of the world where it is even harder to break through into the top rung of motorsport."

Passing judgment: Hamilton must stay aggressive

When Chandhok lines up on the grid for the race he will be alongside his compatriot Narain Karthikeyan, who is in his first season with Hispania.

Both drivers will be hoping to be in the cockpit when India makes its bow as a Formula One venue with a grand prix in New Delhi on October 30.
