(CNN) -- Ronaldinho's participation in this summer's World Cup finals now appears in serious doubt after the AC Milan playmaker was not named in Brazil coach Carlos Dunga's 22-man squad for next month's friendly international against Ireland in London.

The 29-year-old former Barcelona star has been in outstanding form for the Italian giants this season -- but he has still not done enough to force his way into Dunga's thinking for the match at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium.

Ronaldinho is not the only high-profile player not selected for the match, with Chelsea central defender Alex also left out of the squad.

Manchester City forward Robinho, who is currently on loan for the rest of the season with Brazilian club Santos, is in the squad -- while there is also a place for full-back Dani Alves, although the Barcelona defender is currently sidelined with a calf injury that is expected to keep him out for around three weeks.

Brazil squad to face Ireland:

Goalkeepers: Julio Cesar (Inter Milan), Doni (Roma).

Defenders:  Maicon (Inter Milan), Daniel Alves (Barcelona), Lucio (Inter Milan), Juan (Roma), Thiago Silva (AC Milan), Luisao (Benfica), Michel Bastos (Lyon).

Midfielders: Gilberto (Cruzeiro), Gilberto Silva (Panathinaikos), Felipe Melo (Juventus), Josue (Wolfsburg), Kleberson (Flamengo), Ramires (Benfica), Elano (Galatasaray).

Forwards: Kaka (Real Madrid), Robinho (Santos), Nilmar (Villarreal), Luis Fabiano (Sevilla), Adriano (Flamengo), Julio Baptista (Roma).
