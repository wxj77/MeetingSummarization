(CNN) -- The Department of Justice served the state of West Virginia two subpoenas this week, the governor's office said late Friday, adding that they had "not been informed that Governor [Joe] Manchin or any other state employee is under investigation."

The statement came after West Virginia Watchdog, a state chapter of the nonprofit Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity, reported the subpoenas are part of a federal grand jury investigation into work done at the Governor's Mansion in Charleston.

West Virginia Watchdog asked for contracts and records for businesses that have done work at the mansion.

The Justice Department had no comment.

Manchin's office said in a written statement that neither of the two subpoenas "was directed to Governor Manchin or the Governor's Office" and that "no individual" in his office was served.

"The Governor has directed State officials to fully cooperate and comply expeditiously," the statement said. "Governor Manchin wants to get to the bottom of the issue as soon as possible."

Steven Allen Adams, the West Virginia Watchdog managing editor who also works for the conservative-leaning Public Policy Foundation of West Virginia, cited an unnamed source who said Manchin was the target of the probe.

Manchin, a Democrat, has been in office since 2005. He announced in July he would seek to fill the unexpired term of the late Sen. Robert Byrd.
