(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal and second seed Roger Federer are through to the quarterfinals of the Monte Carlo Masters after straight sets victories on Thursday.

Top seed Nadal, who is aiming for a remarkable seventh successive win on the Monaco clay, saw off local favorite and 13th seed Richard Gasquet 6-2 6-4 in 93 minutes.

"I'm very happy how I played today," Nadal told the official ATP Tour website. "I think I played much better than yesterday.

"In general, I think it was a very positive victory against a very difficult opponent," continued the Spaniard.

Gasquet, who hails from nearby Nice, has now lost all his eight matches against Nadal, who is unbeaten in Monte Carlo since 2003.

Federer was also in impressive form as he cruised past 15th-seeded Croat Marin Cilic 6-4 6-3.

"Today was another solid performance, which I'm very happy about. I'm happy that I'm solid on my serve," said the Swiss.

"That allows me then to get an opportunity, when I'm returning, which could be the set if I can then break," he added.

Third seed Andy Murray maintained his revival with a 6-3 6-3 success over Gilles Simon while fourth seed David Ferrer of Spain continued his progress by crushing Canadian Milos Raonic, who made a staggering 40 unforced errors, 6-1 6-3.

Meanwhile, 11th seed Viktor Troicki is also through to the last eight after opponent Tommy Rodrebo was forced to pull out with a thigh injury while leading 6-3 1-2.

There was a shock when Ivan Ljubicic upset Czech fifth seed Tomas Berdych 6-4 6-2 -- and the Croatian veteran must now face the daunting challenge of stopping Nadal from reaching the semifinals.

Talking about facing Ljubicic, Nadal added: "He is a very experienced player. He played well against Berdych and it is going to be a really difficult match for me."
