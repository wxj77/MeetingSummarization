(CNN) -- GLAAD has declared Thursday, October 16, to be #SpiritDay and is asking everyone to wear purple to protest bullying and to show support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth.

"Observed annually since 2010, individuals, schools, organizations, corporations, and public figures wear purple, which symbolizes 'spirit' on the rainbow flag," GLAAD's site explains.

Eight out of 10 LGBT youths report being bullied, according to the organization.

Several celebrities, including "Orange is the New Black" actress Laverne Cox, have stepped up for #SpiritDay, donning purple clothing or tinting their profile photos purple for the cause. This year, Cox became the first transgender person to be nominated for an Emmy.

Morning news anchors across the country wore purple this morning in support of the cause. WFAA's Alexa Conomos posed with the Dallas station's meteorologist Colleen Coyle.

The cast of BBC America's "Orphan Black" put together a short video asking people around the globe to wear purple on October 16. Fans of the show use the hashtag #Clonesbians in support of its LGBT characters: main character Sarah's foster brother, lesbian clone Cosima and transgender clone Tony.

ABC Family tweeted a photo of actress Lucy Hale, who plays Aria Montgomery on the hit show "Pretty Little Liars," in a purple T-shirt.

The cast of ABC Family's "The Fosters," about a lesbian couple raising their blended family, got into #SpiritDay as well.

This mom's #TBT, or Throwback Thursday, post takes a stance against bullying.

If there was ever a movie with an anti-bullying message, it's "Mean Girls." Instead of wearing pink like the Plastics, you can wear purple to support LGBT youth.
