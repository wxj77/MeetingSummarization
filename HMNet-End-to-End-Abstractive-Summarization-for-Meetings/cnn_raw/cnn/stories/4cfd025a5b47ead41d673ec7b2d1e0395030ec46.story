(CNN) -- Nicki Minaj suffered a swollen lip when a man shoved a suitcase across her chin Monday night at a Dallas hotel, but the hip-hop artist refused to file a complaint against him, according to a police report.

Minaj, 28, and Safaree Samuels, 30, had "a verbal altercation" at the Hotel Palomar pool, Dallas police said. The dispute continued in the hotel room that they shared, according to the report.

After Minaj told Samuels "that she didn't want him taking anything out of the room," she peered into a suitcase where he had packed "some of his personal belongings," the report said.

Samuels "grabbed the suitcase and as he was picking it up, he shoved the suitcase across (her) chin and lower lip," the document said.

Her "teeth struck the inside of her lower lip, causing the inside of the lower lip to cut and start to bleed," the police report said. The officer "observed a slight swelling and redness" on her chin, it said.

Minaj declined to have photos taken or to file a complaint, police said. "She just wanted her suitcase back," the report said.

The rapper-singer-songwriter told police she and Samuels "were only friends and had never been involved in an intimate relationship and were not related at all," it said.

Minaj was in Dallas for a Tuesday night show at the American Airlines Center.
