(CNN)  -- New French sensation Christophe Lemaitre completed the 100-200 sprint double at the European Championships in Barcelona on Friday but only after a desperately close finish to the longer race.

Lemaitre, who won the 100m title on Wednesday, hit the front in his final stride as he overhauled and then outdipped Britain's Christian Malcolm to win in 20.37 seconds.

Welshman Malcolm, so often the nearly man at major championships, led from the gun and was clocked in 20.38 seconds.

Lemaitre's compatriot Martial Mbandjock took his second bronze of the championships after finishing third in the 100m.

The 20-year-old Lemaitre has burst onto the scene this year, breaking the 10 second barrier for the 100m.

He succeeds Portugal's Francis Obikwelu, who also achieved the 100m-200m double in 2006.

He will now target a third gold medal as part of a strong French team in the 4x100m relay this weekend.
