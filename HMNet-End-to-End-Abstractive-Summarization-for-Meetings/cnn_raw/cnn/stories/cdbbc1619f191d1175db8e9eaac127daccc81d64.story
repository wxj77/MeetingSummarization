(CNN) -- TP Mazembe from the Democratic Republic of Congo defeated Tunisian team Esperance 6-1 on aggregate to retain their African Champion's League title on Saturday.

Having won the first leg 5-0, Mazembe were overwhelming favorites ahead of the clash in Rades but fell behind to an early goal from Esperance's Ghanaian defender Harrison Afful.

The team from Tunis' celebrations were cut short moments later when Ben Amor was sent off for spitting at an opposition player.

Mazembe sealed a second successive triumph with just over 20 minutes remaining, when Mukok Kanda equalized and ended any hopes of an Esperance comeback.

The Congolese-league winners have created history by becoming the first team to retain African-club football's top honor twice, having previously won back-to-back crowns in 1967-68.

Lamine N'Diaye -- Mazembe head coach -- was delighted to have captured the African Champion's League in his first season with the team.

"It was a big challenge, and I feel proud to have achieved the ultimate in African club football," N'Diaye told the website of football's world governing body, FIFA.

"I've had great joy in football, but this victory is a lot of happiness. At club level you always try to do better, but this is formidable."
