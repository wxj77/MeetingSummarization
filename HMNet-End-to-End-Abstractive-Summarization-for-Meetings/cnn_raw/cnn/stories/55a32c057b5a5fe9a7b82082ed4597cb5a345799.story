The White House announced Monday that the First Family's personal chef, Sam Kass, is leaving and will move to New York.

Kass also heads up the First Lady's "Let's Move!" initiative, aimed at ending childhood obesity and promoting healthy eating habits among youth, and serves as the White House senior policy adviser on nutrition.

First Lady Michelle Obama praised Kass for his work on improving nutrition for the nation.

"Sam leaves an extraordinary legacy of progress, including healthier food options in grocery store aisles, more nutritious school lunches, and new efforts that have improved how healthy food is marketed to our kids," she said.

He's been one of Obama's key liaisons with the education community as she's sought to implement improved nutritional standards for school lunches. But that role has not been without controversy, as students have boycotted the lunches and the Student Nutrition Association, an organization that represents cafeteria workers and their allies, has argued the standards are too much of a burden on schools and students.

Kass was, in fact, denied a request to speak at the SNA's annual convention this summer, after previously enjoying a warm and active partnership with the group in helping to publicize and implement the new standards.

In the White House, however, Kass is a noncontroversial figure, a friend of the President who the first White House home-brewed. Indeed, he's so close with the Obamas that they attended his wedding with MSNBC host Alex Wagner.

Obama said Kass has left "an indelible mark" on the White House.

"Over the years, Sam has grown from a close friend to a critical member of my team, and I am grateful for his outstanding work and look forward to seeing all that he will continue to achieve in the years ahead," the president said in a statement.

The White House said a successor will be named next year.
