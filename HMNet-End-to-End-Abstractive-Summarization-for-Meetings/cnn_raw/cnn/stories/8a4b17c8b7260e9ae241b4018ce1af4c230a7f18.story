(CNN) -- This month on Inside the Middle East -- Zain Verjee hosts from Doha, Qatar.

Art Treasures Revealed

Ancient art finds a modern home in Doha at the Museum of Islamic Art as it celebrates its first anniversary. From jewelry to textiles to ceramics and metal work, the galleries host an unparalleled collection of artifacts spanning the 7th to the 19th centuries, from Spain to China. The minimal Arabesque cubism design of the building was done by award-winning architect I.M. Pei, famed for his Pyramid at Paris' Louvre Museum. Schams Elwazer takes us inside Doha's cultural landmark.

Campus Forum -- University students share their thoughts

In a region where 60 percent of the population is under 30-years-old, IME is going to universities to gauge the pulse on campuses and to speak to tomorrow's business and industry leaders. On this edition we visit the Virginia Commonwealth University in Qatar and ask design students about their passions, concerns, identity issues, and what it means to be young in the Middle East today.

On campus we also catch up with an industry leader -- architect and humanitarian entrepreneur Cameron Sinclair of Architecture for Humanity and hear his message of global action to young design students.
