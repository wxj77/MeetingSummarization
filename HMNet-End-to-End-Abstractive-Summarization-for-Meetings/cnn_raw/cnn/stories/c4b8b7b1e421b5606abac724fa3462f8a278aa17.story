(CNN) -- Dark smoke rose from the upper floors of Radio France's headquarters in Paris on Friday as a fire prompted an evacuation of the building.

There were no reports of injuries, Radio France spokeswoman Marine Billoir said. Firefighters eventually extinguished the flames, reported France Info radio, part of Radio France.

The fire started in an unoccupied section that was under construction, Billoir said. Information on what caused the fire wasn't immediately available.

Pictures distributed by Agence France-Presse and Getty Images showed smoke billowing out of several upper-floor windows of the circular facility.

Photos on social media also showed smoke rising above the Paris skyline, visible from some distance.
