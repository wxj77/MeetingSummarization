(CNN) -- Mila Kunis -- and her baby bump and engagement ring -- are out of hiding.

After shying away from discussing her pregnancy and relationship with Ashton Kutcher, Kunis has opened up to Ellen DeGeneres about both the baby and her future husband.

In an episode of "Ellen," the 30-year-old actress marveled that she and Kutcher, 36, were able to keep their growing family and wedding plans under wraps "for a very long time."

"We were able to keep (our engagement) private for two months without anybody knowing," Kunis said. "I think everybody assumed we'd been engaged for so long, that I was wearing the ring in public for two months and nobody commented on it."

Even when the cat was out of the bag, Kunis and Kutcher declined to make a public announcement, and they did the same with their baby news.

On "Ellen," Kunis was still coy about details -- she wouldn't reveal her due date, the baby's gender or the name they've chosen -- but she did jokingly confirm that the little one will arrive "sometime this year, I promise you."

So far, Kunis has had a "stereotypical" pregnancy, with cravings for salty snacks like sauerkraut and pickles. To help out his fiancee, Kutcher has stocked their "secondary fridge" with things Kunis might want, from ice cream to anchovies.

"He kind of pre-empted this. He assumed I was going to have goofy cravings," Kunis said. "It happened last week. I was like, 'Oh my God, I need a pickle.' And he was like, 'Hold on a second,' and disappeared into the backyard and came back with the most amazing dill pickle of all time."

That's not the only way Kutcher's trying to be helpful. He's also learning Russian. Kunis, who's from the Ukraine, already speaks the language, and he wants to be able to speak Russian to the baby, too.

As far as her birth plan, "I'm going to do it as all natural as I possibly can, unless there's an emergency," Kunis said, confirming that she plans to go without an epidural. "I did this to myself, I might as well do it right."
