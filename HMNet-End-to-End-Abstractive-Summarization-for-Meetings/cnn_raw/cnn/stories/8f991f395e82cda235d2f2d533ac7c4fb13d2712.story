(CNN) -- "Dancing with the Stars" is down from 13 competitors to 12 after season 19's first elimination on Tuesday.

The unlucky star going home was Olympic athlete Lolo Jones, who was part of one of the worst-performing teams during the season premiere on Monday night. Thanks to missed cues, her cha-cha with pro partner Keo Motsepe scored a 22 and put her in danger of being sent home.

In the end, it was fashion designer Betsey Johnson, who was in last place on Monday, who gets to dance another week.

When her elimination was announced, Jones, who had been openly frustrated about her performance, said she "wouldn't have it any other way."

"I know Betsey (Johnson) had a malfunction ... and that was a disadvantage for her," Jones said Tuesday. "I'm glad she's staying, and she deserves to stay."

On Facebook, Jones shared with fans how disappointed she was with her "Dancing" routine and her apprehension about the criticism she felt was sure to come in light of past struggles at Olympic games.

"When I was dancing last night and messed up I had flashbacks of the three Olympics ... that people constantly tease me about," Jones said. "I thought oh no here it comes again. People are going to ridicule me. I'm so tired of feeling embarrassed."

But the tough moment also taught Jones, who is a devout Christian, something about her faith.

"My brief time on â€ª#â€ŽDWTSâ€¬ was a lasting lesson," she said. "I really wanted to stay on the show and have the layers of hurt wash away by showing the public how hard I work. I wanted to come away a victor for once. ... But that is my way of thinking. Not God's. Instead, I need to trust God that he would heal my heart. ... My time was brief but the lesson is lasting."
