Washington (CNN) -- An 8-year-old North Carolina girl is sick of the heated Senate race where more than $100 million has been spent on mostly negative TV ads.

Raleigh third-grader Carson Park wrote a letter to Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan and her Republican challenger, state House Speaker Thom Tillis, asking them to stop with the ads.

"Why aren't you talking about ways that you will help us? All I hear is your ads where you say mean things about each other," she wrote.

As a result of the negative ads, she told CNN affiliate WTVD that "you don't know what they're really like."

Hagan and Tillis are locked in what polls suggest is the nation's closest battles.

The race could be key to Republicans' efforts to pick up at least six seats and win control of the Senate.

Spending in the race recently topped $100 million, with $72 million of that coming from outside groups. It's the 2014 cycle's most expensive Senate race.
