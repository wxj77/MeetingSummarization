The mass wedding ceremony was held at 8 a.m. at a pavilion of the Taipei International Flora Exposition.

Taipei's Mayor Hau Lung-bin served as the chief witness, and sent out his blessing at 9:09 a.m.The couples also received blessings from area temples, where bells were rung to celebrate the event.
