(CNN) -- A 21-year-old woman shot in New Orleans' French Quarter on Sunday has died, New Orleans Police Department Officer Garry Flot said Wednesday.

The woman was among 10 people shot on Bourbon Street about 2:45 a.m. Sunday. Police say they're searching for two people.

Three people remain hospitalized, all in stable condition, New Orleans Police public information officer Frank Robertson III said Wednesday.

New Orleans Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas has said the shooting may have happened because of a heated exchange between two young men.

The 700 block of Bourbon Street, where the shooting occurred, is a popular gathering place for tourists and revelers, where many of them pack bars and clubs between St. Peter and St. Ann streets. Crowds often spill into the streets.

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu has called for additional resources from the federal government and the state of Louisiana to combat violence in the city.

He asked President Obama to send a "targeted surge team" of federal law enforcement officers to help stem crime. He asked Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to assign 100 state police officers to the city and rededicate a penny from the hotel/motel tax from the convention center to the city for public safety.

"These kinds of incidents will not go unanswered," Landrieu said. "These perpetrators will be brought to justice."
