There are still more than 1.7 million Americans alive who served in World War II, but that number is dwindling fast.

With much of the "Greatest Generation" now in their 80s and 90s, hundreds of these veterans are dying every day, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

By the year 2036, the VA estimates, there will no longer be any living veterans from the conflict.

The last World War I veteran, Frank Buckles, died in February 2011.
