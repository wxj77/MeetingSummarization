Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Comedian Betty White -- currently enjoying a career resurgence at age 88 -- said Wednesday that she credits her longevity in the entertainment industry to "sheer blind luck."

"I'm the luckiest old broad that ever drew a breath," White told CNN's "Larry King Live."

After a cameo on a popular Super Bowl commercial in January and a series of comedic sketches on Craig Ferguson's "Late, Late Show," White's fans campaigned successfully via Facebook for her to host NBC's "Saturday Night Live."

White admitted to King that she was nervous about the May 8 show and said she finds herself questioning, "What are they doing with me?"

She said she had been approached to host "SNL" three times "many, many years ago," but declined because she associated the show with New York, and as a California girl, "I'm so not New York."

White got her start in show business in 1949 on a local television show. She went on to star in two hit sitcoms, "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "Golden Girls."

"I think the reason for the longevity is that ... several generations have gotten to know me over the years so I've become ... sort of part of the family," she said.

Most recently, she appeared in the blockbuster "The Proposal" with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. And to add to her current hot streak, White recently signed on to be a series regular on a new TV Land cable channel sitcom titled "Hot in Cleveland" opposite Jane Leeves, Wendie Malick and Valerie Bertinelli.

"I'm not hot again, but I'm surprised to still be working," White said. "I just am amazed and I'm thrilled and I'm going along with it and enjoying it."

White has also continued her work for animal health and well-being, including a 46-year partnership with the Los Angeles Zoo, calling it one of her two loves in life -- alongside show business of course.

"It's such fun," she said. "Why should you stop something you enjoy so much?"
