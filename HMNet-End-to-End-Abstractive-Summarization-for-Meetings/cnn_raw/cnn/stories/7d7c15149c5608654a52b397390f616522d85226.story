(CNN) -- AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso has been banned for four matches by UEFA after he "assaulted" Tottenham's assistant manager during their Champions League tie.

The Italian grabbed 59-year-old Joe Jordan round the throat during the match as tempers flared, then as the pair came face-to-face after the final whistle, Gattuso launched a head-butt.

UEFA charged the 33-year-old with "gross sporting misconduct" after Milan's 1-0 defeat in the first leg of their last 16 tie with the English Premier League club at the San Siro stadium.

He was due to miss the second leg next week anyway after picking up his third yellow card of the competition during the clash.

A statement on UEFA's website read: "AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso has been suspended for four competition matches by the UEFA control and disciplinary body.

"The control and disciplinary body ruled that Gattuso had assaulted the Tottenham Hotspur assistant coach Joe Jordan after the match.

"Gattuso, who was also cautioned in the 76th minute of the game, is already suspended for the return leg of the UEFA Champions League tie against Tottenham after receiving three yellow cards.

"Consequently, the four-match suspension applies to the next four UEFA club competition matches for which he would be eligible."

The ex-Glasgow Rangers star came to blows with England striker Peter Crouch during the game, in which Milan struggled to find a way past their opponents.

Gattuso did apologize to Jordan after the game, admitting: "I lost my head."

"I'm taking responsibility because I did something I shouldn't have done," he added.

"I made a mistake doing what I did to an older person, and that's it. I will wait and see what UEFA decides now."
