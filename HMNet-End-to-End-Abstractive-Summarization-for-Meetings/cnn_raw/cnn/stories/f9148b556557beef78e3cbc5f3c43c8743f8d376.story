Fifty-two people are missing after a South Korean fishing boat sank in the Bering Sea, the South Korean government said.

The vessel sank Monday with 60 crew members on board. Eight people were rescued, but one of them later died, said Kim Hong-won, an official at the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.

The cause of the sinking, in the frigid waters that lie between far-eastern Russia and Alaska, wasn't clear.

The crew consisted of 35 Indonesians, 13 Filipinos, 11 South Koreans and one Russian, Kim said.
