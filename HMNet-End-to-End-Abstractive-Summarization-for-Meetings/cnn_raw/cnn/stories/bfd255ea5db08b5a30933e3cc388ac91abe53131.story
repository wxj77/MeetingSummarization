(CNN)Bad news, Benedict Cumberbatch fans: The Oscar nominee is officially off the market.

The star of "The Imitation Game" and "The Hobbit" married pregnant fiancee Sophie Hunter on Saturday in a quiet ceremony on the British Isle of Wight.

"Benedict and Sophie were married yesterday surrounded by their close friends and family," Cumberbatch's representative Karon Maskill told CNN.

"It was a magical day."

Everyone's favorite modern "Sherlock" announced his engagement the old-fashioned way -- in the newspaper -- back in November.

The "Star Trek Into Darkness" actor, who has a massive following online, is expected to attend the Oscars next Sunday, where he is nominated for best actor for "The Imitation Game."

Hunter is a British playwright, actress and singer, known for directing theater productions.
