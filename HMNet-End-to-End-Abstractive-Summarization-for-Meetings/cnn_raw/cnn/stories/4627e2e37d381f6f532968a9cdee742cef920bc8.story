(CNN) -- "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" takes Henry Cavill's Superman to new places, but one thing remains the same: the hero's iconic suit.

On Thursday, Warner Bros. shared the first image of Cavill suited up as Superman, with the "S" on his chest firmly in place as he stares through a grim-looking rain.

The photo comes just a few days after Cavill was spotted on the set of "Batman v Superman" dressed as Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent.

"The more time I spend with Henry, the more he's Superman to me," director Zack Snyder told USA Today of the British actor, who made his debut as the high-flying hero in 2013's "Man of Steel."

Now, with the "Man of Steel" sequel "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Cavill and Snyder are eager to stretch the Kryptonian's identity, examining who he is as a protector of Metropolis and as an everyday gent. He'll still be working with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) at the Daily Planet, but he'll also find himself moving into Gotham City, where Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) presents a threat.

"We've both created this guy, and we can push him around a little bit," Snyder said.

But will it be Ben Affleck's Batman doing the pushing? After all, this will be the first time that Batman and Superman are on the big screen together.

Snyder wouldn't say, but he did point out that the movie title's spelling is intentional. Using a "v" instead of a "vs" was "to keep it from being a straight 'versus' movie, even in the most subtle way," he told the paper. "It's never really been done and it's kinda cool."

"Dawn of Justice" also brings in a number of other characters, including Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). As for Affleck's Batman, Snyder told the paper fans should expect a weary, seasoned take on the character. "It's cooler to see a crusty old Batman beating the snot out of guys," Snyder said.

"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" is currently in production, and scheduled for a May 6, 2016 release.
