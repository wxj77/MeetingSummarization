(CNN) -- Clipped wings no more, the Blue Angels are soaring again. The blue and gold jets are returning to the sky after being grounded much of last year because of forced spending cuts.

The U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron kicked off the 2014 air show season with its first show Saturday, March 15, at Naval Air Facility El Centro in California.

The nation's best military fliers halted their iconic aerobatic performances in April 2013.

But aerospace and military fans are rejoicing as the Blue Angels return this year for more dynamic aerial demonstrations. The team is scheduled for 68 performances at 35 locations between now and November 8.
