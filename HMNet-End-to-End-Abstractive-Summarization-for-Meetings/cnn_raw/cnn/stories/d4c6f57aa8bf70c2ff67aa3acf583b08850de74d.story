(CNN) -- Indonesian authorities say they have arrested five people after allegedly finding $2.6 million worth of cocaine in a British woman's luggage.

Lindsay June Sandiford was found to have blocks of cocaine in her suitcase after she arrived in Bali on a Thai Airways flight, government officials said.

She covered her face as she was escorted in front of the media Monday.

Sandiford -- who was described as a 55-year-old housewife by the British media -- has not made a public statement. Video from Monday did not show her speaking. Three other Britons and an Indian national are also being questioned, the BBC said.

"The cocaine brought by the smuggler was of the very rare type," Made Wijaya, head of the airport's customs office, told the official Antara news agency. Sandiford allegedly had 4.8 kilograms (10.6 pounds) of the drug, the report said.

The drug sells on the black market at $533 per gram -- making the full load worth $2.6 million, the state news agency said.

In the course of the investigation, authorities also arrested three more people from Britain and one from India in connection with the alleged drug transportation, all accused of being "part of an international syndicate," the state-run news agency said.

The British Foreign Office said it is "aware" of the arrests and is "ready to provide consular assistance."

Indonesia carries tough penalties for drug offenses and smugglers can face the death penalty.
