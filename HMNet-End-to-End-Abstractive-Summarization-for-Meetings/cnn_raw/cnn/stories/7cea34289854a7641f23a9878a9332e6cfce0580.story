(CNN) -- Two of Malaga's big-name pre-season signings engineered the Spanish club's first win of the new La Liga season on Monday.

Spain internationals Santi Cazorla and Joaquin Sanchez both scored twice in the 4-0 victory at promoted Granada, relieving the pressure on coach Manuel Pellegrini after the opening-day defeat by Sevilla.

The former Real Madrid boss was given a big transfer kitty by Qatari owner Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nassar Al-Thani after Malaga flirted with relegation last season before finishing 11th.

Cazorla, who cost $27 million when he joined from Villarreal in August, netted the opening goal four minutes into his home debut in the Andalusian derby.

Fellow winger Joaquin, who signed for $5.5 million from Valencia, doubled the lead on 25 with a header from a cross by Jesus Gamez, and Cazorla made it 3-0 with a free-kick two minutes after the halftime break.

Cazorla set up Joaquin for the fourth in the 72nd minute to leave Granada bottom of the table below Sporting Gijon, with both clubs losing their first two matches.

In England's Premier League, unbeaten Newcastle moved up to fourth place despite being held 0-0 away to promoted Queen's Park Rangers.

The home side ended a run of three defeats after manager Neil Warnock gave midfielder Joey Barton the captain's armband against his former club.
