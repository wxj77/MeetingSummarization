Robert Plant has reportedly thrown a wrench in another "Celebration Day" for Led Zeppelin fans -- though his publicist said the report was "rubbish."

According to a report in the UK Daily Mirror, the Zeppelin lead singer turned down a Â£500 million ($800 million) contract for a Led Zeppelin reunion.

The other members of the band -- Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones -- were all in, a source told the paper. Jason Bonham, son of the band's late drummer John Bonham, would have taken a fee.

However, Plant's publicist told the UK Guardian that the Mirror report was "rubbish."

The offer to re-form the band was reportedly made by Virgin chairman Richard Branson, a fan of the group, and would have set up dates in three locales: London, Berlin and New Jersey.

"Jimmy, John and Jason signed up immediately," the source told the paper. "It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him."

Branson would have flown the group around in one of his jets and offered the group the opportunity to do more gigs if they so desired.

"He is gutted," the source said.

Led Zeppelin, one of the most influential groups of all time, broke up in 1980 following Bonham's death, but reunited for four occasions, most recently a show at London's O2 Arena in honor of Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun, who signed the band in 1968.

Plant is currently touring with another band, the Sensational Shape Shifters, behind his new solo album, "Lullaby and ... the Ceaseless Roar." He has been skeptical of all the attention Zeppelin inevitably gets, as it has this year with the re-release of its first five albums.

"This propagation of myths and anti-myths will continue forever," he told Rolling Stone.
