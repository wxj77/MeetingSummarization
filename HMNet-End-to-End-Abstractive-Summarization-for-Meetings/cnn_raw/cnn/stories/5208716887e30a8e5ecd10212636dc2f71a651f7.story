(CNN) -- A male student at Virginia's Liberty University was shot and killed early Tuesday by an emergency services officer after an altercation at a women's dorm, Lynchburg police said.

Police and paramedics responded to the residence hall near the main campus at 4:07 a.m. The victim, who has not been identified pending notification of his family, was shot during a fight with the university officer, police said. It was unclear if the student was armed.

Police said that the shooting was an isolated incident and that the campus was open.

Lt. David Gearhart said police would release more details later Tuesday.

Liberty was founded by the late Jerry Falwell Sr. in 1971.
