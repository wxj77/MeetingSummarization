(CNN) -- Udinese have gone top of the Italian Serie A table on goal difference from Lazio after captain Antonio Di Natale was again on target in a 2-1 victory over Siena on Sunday.

With previous leaders Juventus seeing their match against Napoli called off because of torrential rain, Udinese, Lazio and Milan all exploited the situation with wins, dropping Juve to fourth place.

Udinese took the lead after just 54 seconds against Siena, when Dusan Basta prodded the ball home from close range.

And the prolific Di Natale doubled the advantage in the 64th minute when he cut inside a defender to finish Pablo Armero's long ball.

Siena pulled a goal back 13 minutes from time when Francesco Bolzoni fired home Emanuele Calaio's header on the half-volley, but the home side held on to move onto 21 points from their 10 games.

Lazio are level on point, but have just a single goal inferior goal difference following a 1-0 home win over Parma.

Giuseppe Sculli poked home the winner with just five minutes remaining to leave Edy Reja's side firmly in the championship race.

However, the performance of the day came from Milan, who are ominously just a point behind in third position after thrashing Catania 4-0.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic opened the scoring with a seventh minute penalty after Davide Lanzafame fouled Robinho in the area.

Brazilian striker Robinho then helped himself to the second goal in the 24th minute, curling the bal home after Ibrahimovic had sent him clear on the left wing.

The same two players combined again for a 69th minute third goal, with Robinho's strike being bundled over the line by back-tracking defender Francesco Lodi.

And Gianluca Zambrotta added the icing on the cake for Milan three minutes later when he was on hand to score after Alberto Aquilani's free-kick had been fumbled.
