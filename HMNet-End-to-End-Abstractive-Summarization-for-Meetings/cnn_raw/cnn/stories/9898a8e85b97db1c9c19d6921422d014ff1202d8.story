(CNN) -- Since Apple released iOS 7, its completely revamped operating system for the iPhone, reviews have been mixed but mostly positive.

However, a glitch that has quietly plagued iPhone users â€” the "white/black screen of death," a bug that abruptly soft reboots the smartphone â€” will finally be addressed in a future iOS 7 update.

"We have a fix in an upcoming software update for a bug that can occasionally cause a home screen crash," Apple spokesperson Trudy Muller told Mashable.

Some of the first reports of the glitch began to crop up as early as September on Apple's discussion forums, and subsequently appeared on various social media channels like Twitter.

Based on various reports, the color of the boot-up screen depends on the color of your iPhone's face. A white iPhone face produces a white boot up screen with a black Apple logo, while a device with a black face produces a black screen with a white Apple logo.

The glitch appears to affect any iPhone running iOS 7, with some users reporting that the sudden shutting off occurs once the iPhone's battery dips down into the 30% level.

The update is rumored to land alongside iOS 7.1, which is currently in its fourth beta with developers. In addition to fixing the "white screen of death," iOS 7.1 is expected to bring some minor UI and design changes.
