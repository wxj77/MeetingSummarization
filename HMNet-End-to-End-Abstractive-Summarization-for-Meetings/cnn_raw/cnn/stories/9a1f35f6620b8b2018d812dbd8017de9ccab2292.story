(CNN) -- Prince William has given his first official interview to CNN since his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, gave birth to their first child.

The future king of Britain sat down with CNN's Max Foster to talk about baby George, his wife Catherine, and what it's like to be a new father.

The interview is part of a one-hour special, "Prince William's Passion: New Father, New Hope," which will premiere on CNN and CNN International on Sunday, September 15 at 10:00 p.m. ET.

A portion of the interview will air on CNN on Monday, August 19 at 8:00 a.m. ET.

The special chronicles the prince's passion for Africa and his dream to save the world's most endangered species.

As a new father, the prince discusses his hope that one day his son can experience the same Africa that he and Prince Harry did as young boys.

Britain's royal family has worked on conservation in Africa for generations. In the one-hour TV special William tells CNN how his love of Africa and its endangered species were instilled in him by his father, Prince Charles, and late mother Princess Diana.

The prince also highlights some of the work being done by individuals in the area of conservation including Tusk, an organization for which he and Prince Harry are both patrons.
