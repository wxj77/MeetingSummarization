(CNN) -- Funeral services for former vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro were held Thursday morning in New York.

The 9:30 a.m. service at the Church of Saint Vincent Ferrer was for family and friends and was closed to the press, a family statement said.

A resident of New York City, Ferraro died Saturday at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Ferraro's cause of death was complications from multiple myeloma, a blood cancer she had battled for 12 years, according to a statement released by her family in Boston.

In 1984, the congresswoman from New York became the first female vice-presidential candidate from a major U.S. political party when she was picked as the running mate for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale.
