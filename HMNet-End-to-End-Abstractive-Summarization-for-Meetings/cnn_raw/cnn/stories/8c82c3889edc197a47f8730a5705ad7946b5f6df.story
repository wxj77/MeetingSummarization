(CNN) -- Stale, contaminated nuts and pretzels served in a culture dish are standard fare in most bars.

But some establishments across the country aren't only taking their countertop cuisine to new levels -- bomboloni, gougères, croque monsieur! -- they've decided to give it to patrons on the house.

Gratis bar food may be a dying tradition in some quarters, but we found a number of joints that don't care about cost or mess, opting to dry your whistle before they wet it. Here are ten of the finest, for starters. Serve us up your own favorites.

1. Crunch-fried hominy

Yardbird Southern Table & Bar, Miami

While fried chicken is the star at this James Beard-recognized Southern indulgery, the crunch-fried hominy is the snack that keeps drinkers sated, free of charge.

Chef Jeff McInnis provides a menu packed with other cuisine beloved by ladies and gents who are more than picky when it comes to Southern food.

2. Gougères

No. 9 Park, Boston

If you haven't tried a gougère, yet -- a baked savory choux pastry of dough and cheese -- it's time you started.

You can test your taste buds for free at No. 9 Park in Boston They're so good you'd gladly pay for them -- except you don't have to.

3. Mussels

Cucina di Pesce, New York

Free nuts and popcorn tell you you're in a dive bar, but free mussels? That's classy.

Cucina di Pesce has been serving them up with the purchase of a beverage for more than 20 years, and with restaurants suspending their free-food deals left and right, those mussels taste all the sweeter. (Well, saltier. You know what we mean.)

4. Truffle arancini

Dovetail, New York

Guests at Dovetail's bar are served a complimentary snack trio consisting of a truffle arancini, a whole wheat rosemary cracker and house-made white cheddar cornbread. Dainty and delicious, it's served on a wooden cheese board from chef John Fraser.

5. Bomboloni with vanilla ice cream, pasta, mortadella focaccia

SD26, New York

6. Peanut Bomb

AJ Bomber's, Milwaukee

Any bar can serve free peanuts, but only one has set up a "P-nut delivery system," which shoots legumes to various sections of the bar via overhead zip line. It's possible to situate your open mouth under the P-nut Bomb bay doors, though it's not recommended.

And the shells? Just throw 'em on the floor -- it's what everyone else does.

8. Rosemary popcorn

Hatfield's, Los Angeles

One of the top restaurants in L.A., according to Zagat, this super-romantic spot is known for its imaginative dishes, and its rosemary-hinted popcorn is no exception. It's an unexpected (free) treat for patrons at the bar.
