(CNN) -- We enjoyed some chuckles last week over Spotify's list of its most misquoted songs. Looks like you did, too.

In case you missed it, our story on this cited classic misunderstood lyrics by everyone from Jimi Hendrix ("Excuse me while I kiss this guy") to Creedence Clearwater Revival ("there's a bathroom on the right").

While it's hard to top Elton John's "Hold me closer, Tony Danza," CNN commenters offered up many worthy suggestions for other well-known songs with confusing lyrics. Some submissions appeared to be sincere misunderstandings of the actual songs, while others were clearly jokes.

In some cases, the garbled lyric was better than the real one.

Well done, clever readers! Here are 10 more of our favorites:

-- "Reverend blue jeans," by Neil Diamond. Actual lyric: "Forever in blue jeans." (Submitted by CNN commenter Meerkat)

-- "I left Jermaine down in Africa," by Toto. Actual lyric: "I bless the rain down in Africa." (Timothy A. Johnson)

-- "Like a virgin, touched for the 41st time," by Madonna. Actual lyric: "Like a virgin, touched for the very first time." (AA)

-- "Lucy in disguise with diamonds," by the Beatles. Actual lyric: "Lucy in the sky with diamonds." (Jayme Rosenberger)

-- "Israeli men! Hallelujah!" by the Weather Girls. Actual lyric: "It's raining men! Hallelujah!" (Fire Ant Queen Bachmann)

-- "Open condom style," by Psy. Actual lyric: "Oppan Gangnam style." (Truth Hurts)

-- "I want to rock and roll all night, and part of every day," by Kiss. Actual lyric: "I want to rock and roll all night, and party every day." (BethP)

-- ''It doesn't make a difference if we're naked or not," by Bon Jovi. Actual lyric: "It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not'." (ThreePeas)

-- "Walking in the middle of the land," from the much-recorded holiday song, "Winter Wonderland." Actual lyric: "Walking in a winter wonderland." (Bob Cummins)

Top prize, however, goes to Eddie Money's 1978 hit "Two Tickets to Paradise," which somehow inspired a whole playlist of tortured titles:

-- "I've got ... two tricks and a pair of dice" (Ben)

-- "2 ticks and a parasite" (Lee Ingham)

-- "two crickets and pair of mice" (Train4499)

-- "two Chiclets to sterilize" (allmosttoast)

-- "2 chickens to paralyze" (a guest user).
