(CNN) -- French champions Lille have revealed that Ivory Coast striker Gervinho has expressed an interest in moving to the English Premier League, and transfer talks are planned with Arsenal in the coming weeks.

In an interview with radio station RMC, Lille general manager Frederic Paquet revealed: "He wants to go and has developed contacts with Arsenal.

"We will soon have talks with them and see what they offer. He has expressed a desire to go to England and we will see what happens."

Paquet also confirmed that Paris St Germain had enquired about the player, but the 24-year-old would not be sold to a French rival.

"Paris St Germain inquired about Gervinho but we are not thinking about strengthening a competitor," added Paquet.

Gervinho played a key role for Lille last year, as they won the French league and cup double, scoring 15 goals and having 10 assists in the league alone.

Meanwhile, Manchester City's Germany international defender Jerome Boateng has revealed that he has agreed terms to join Bayern Munich on a four-year contract, although the two clubs have not settled on a transfer fee.

"It is true that I have agreed with Bayern on a four-year deal. Now it is up to Manchester City to make it work. At the moment they are making things a bit difficult," Boateng told Kicker Magazine.

"It is about the position. Bayern want me as a central defender. That is also an advantage for the national team.

"My dream is to have a starting spot within a year, hopefully at Bayern, and then I want to win the European Championship."
