(CNN)Pope Francis, who succeeded a resigning pontiff exactly two years ago, told a Mexican television network Friday that he expects his pontificate will be brief.

"Four or five years," he told Televisa. "I do not know, even two or three. Two have already passed. It is a somewhat vague sensation. Maybe it's like the psychology of the gambler who convinces himself he will lose, so he won't be disappointed and if he wins, is happy. I do not know."

Francis, who was elected in March 2013 after Pope Benedict XVI stepped down, said his predecessor had reopened a door to more popes emeritus.

When asked whether he likes being Pope, he enthusiastically responded: "I do not mind."

Francis, 78, said he feels God only wanted him to lead the Roman Catholic Church for a short time "and nothing more." He said that he would not support putting an age limit on the papacy.

He also enjoys calling on the Pope Emeritus.

"It's like having a wise grandfather at home. One can seek advice," Francis said.

Francis made similar retirement comments in August when he praised Benedict for "his beautiful gesture" and said he might do the same thing one day.

He told Televisa he misses the ability to go out in public without attracting a huge crowd.

"I would like ... to go out one day, without being recognized, and go to a pizzeria for a pizza," he said.

Also Friday, while at a communal penance service at St. Peter's Basilica, the Pope announced a "Jubilee of Mercy" will start in December. The theme will end November 26, 2016, the Vatican said.

There have been 26 jubilees since the first in 1300. The  most recent was in 2000.
