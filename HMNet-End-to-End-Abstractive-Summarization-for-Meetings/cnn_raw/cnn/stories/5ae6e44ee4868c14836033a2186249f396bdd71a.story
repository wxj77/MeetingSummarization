(CNN) -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, his two sons and his former interior minister will be retried April 13, Egypt's state-run news agency Mena said Sunday.

Mubarak is serving a life sentence for his role in the killings of peaceful protesters during the revolution that eventually deposed him.

He and his former interior minister Habib al-Adly appealed their life sentences. And a judge agreed.

The judge also said that others facing charges should also be retried, including six interior ministry deputies.

Essam El-Erian, a senior adviser to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, said in January that the government looked forward to a second trial.

"God willed the retrial would take place under Morsy's rule, with new evidence and new defendants," El-Erian said.

Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years, was found guilty in June of ordering the killing of protesters and was immediately transferred to Tora prison in southern Cairo to serve his life sentence.

The 84-year-old has suffered a range of physical problems since he was driven from office in February 2011, following weeks of protests by Egyptians demanding more freedom and reforms.

He attended his trial later that year on a gurney.

In December, Mubarak was transferred to a military hospital after suffering a head injury and a bruised chest when he slipped in a prison hospital bathroom, Egyptian state-run media reported.
