(EW.com) -- One of the most intriguing movies of 2012 is now one of the most intriguing movies of 2013.

"Gravity," the 3-D sci-fi drama starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts stranded in open space, has been pushed from its November 21 release to 2013 by Warner Bros., EW has confirmed.

The studio remains bullish on the movie, director Alfonso CuarÃ³n's first film since his highly acclaimed 2006 sci-fi drama "Children of Men." But between a lack of available 3-D IMAX screens and a highly competitive holiday moviegoing season that includes a new "Bond" movie, the final "Twilight" movie, and "The Hobbit," Warner Bros. execs wanted to be sure the unusual film had the best possible platform for success.

A new firm release date has not yet been set.
