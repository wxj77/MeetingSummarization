(CNN) -- A man celebrating his friend's impending marriage fell to his death from a Black Hawk, Colorado, hotel window early Saturday, police said.

Dirk Anderson, 29, was sitting on the ledge of an open window in the 11th-floor room at the Lady Luck Hotel and Casino when the screen on which he was leaning gave way, according to reports by CNN television affiliates KUSA and KCNC.

The Thornton, Colorado, man landed on the roof of a parking garage five levels below, police said.

While there was alcohol at the bachelor party, investigators said they don't know if Anderson had been drinking before his fall.

There was no evidence of horseplay and it appeared to be an accident, police said.

Black Hawk, a 19th-century gold-mining town, is home to several casinos that attract tourists and gamblers from Denver, 35 miles away.
