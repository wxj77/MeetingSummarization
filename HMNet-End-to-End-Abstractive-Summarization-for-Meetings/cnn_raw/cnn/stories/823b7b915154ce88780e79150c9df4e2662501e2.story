(CNN) -- Police responded to Facebook's headquarters in Northern California to check on a threat Tuesday night. The threat was deemed noncredible.

It was made at around 7 p.m. local time (10 p.m. ET), said police spokesman Dave Bertini. He did not specify the nature of the threat or how it was made.

Officers closed off the entrance to Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park and asked its employees to stay where they were, the San Jose Mercury News reported. They searched the campus and found nothing suspicious.

Police gave the all-clear, and Facebook's staff departed normally for the night, Bertini told CNN.

The city recently allowed Facebook to pay it $200,000 a year to make a police officer closely accessible to its campus, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

Facebook was founded in 2004, according to its website. Its services have been available to the public since 2006, and it moved into its current Menlo Park headquarters in 2011. The company employed over 6,000 people as of December.
