(CNN) -- After a weekend of rumors, it's finally official: Heidi Klum and Seal are now the proud parents of a baby girl, Klum's representative confirmed.

Heidi Klum met Seal in 2004, and the couple married a year later.

The "Project Runway" host gave birth Friday night. Klum and Seal named their new bundle Lou Sulola Samuel.

The couple, who married in 2005, have been busy babymaking ever since. Lou Sulola is the youngest of four: Henri, 4, Johan, 2 and Leni, 5, whom Klum had from a previous relationship.

"It's difficult to imagine loving another child as much as you love your existing children," Seal said of the birth in a statement Tuesday. "Anyone who has a family will tell you this. Where will one find that extra love? If you love your existing children with all of your heart, how then can one possibly find more heart with which to love another?"

The answer to that question, the Grammy-winning singer said, "came in the form of our fourth child and second daughter.

"Lou Sulola Samuel was born, and from the moment she looked into both of our eyes, it was endless love at first sight. She is beautiful beyond words, and we are happy that she chose us to watch her grow over the coming years," he said.
