Today's program takes you to Vanuatu to show you why recovery efforts are so difficult in the hurricane-stricken nation. We're also visiting a U.S. city that just officially logged its snowiest winter since it started keeping records, and we're exploring a U.S. Army facility charged with the task of safely eliminating U.S. chemical weapons. Plus, see how two American rivers are "going green" as part of St. Patrick's Day celebrations.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
