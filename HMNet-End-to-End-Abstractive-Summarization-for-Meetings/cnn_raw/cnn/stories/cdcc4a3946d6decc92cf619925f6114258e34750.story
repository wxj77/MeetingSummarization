(CNN) -- Paris Saint Germain recorded their first home victory of the season at Parc des Princes with a comfortable 2-0 win over Toulouse on Friday.

Goals in either half by Argentina's Javier Pastore and Swedish international Zlatan Ibrahimovic earned Carlo Ancelotti's men their second successive league win and lifts them to third in Ligue 1 behind leaders Olympic Marseille and second-placed Lyon.

Pastore opened the scoring seven minutes before the break when he latched onto Marco Verratti's through ball before lofting the ball over Ali Ahamada in the Toulouse goal.

Ibrahimovic scored his fifth goal for his new club midway through the second half tapping home from close range after French international Jeremy Menez had beaten the offside trap.

Reigning champions, Montpellier indifferent start to the season continued with a 3-1 loss away to newly-promoted Reims.

Rene Girard's side are currently lying 14th, while Reims second win of the season sees them rise to eighth.

Meanwhile in Italy, Juventus coach Antonio Conte's 10-month ban for corruption has been extended by football's world governing body, FIFA to include all matches worldwide.

"This suspension covers all types of matches, including domestic, international, friendly and official fixtures," a statement on the FIFA website said.

Conte, who led Juventus to the Serie A title last season, was suspended by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) on August 10 for failing to report alleged corruption in two Serie B matches when he was previously in charge of then second flight Siena in 2010-11.

The 43-year-old, who appealed, but failed to overturn the FIGC ban, will now not take charge of the Turin club's upcoming Champions League campaign which kicks off against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on September 19.
