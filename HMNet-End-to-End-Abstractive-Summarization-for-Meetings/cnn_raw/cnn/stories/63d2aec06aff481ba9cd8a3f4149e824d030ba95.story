(CNN) -- David Nalbandian shocked the tennis world and prompted a police investigation with his act of frustration at Queen's Club on Sunday, inadvertently injuring a line judge by kicking out at an advertising board.

The Argentine was disqualified from the final against Marin Cilic, fined $12,500 and forfeited all the prize money he earned at the Wimbledon warmup event. He could face further punishment after London's Metropolitan Police Service announced it was investigating an alleged assault.

But Nalbandian is not the first tennis star to lose his cool on court, with a number of his peers also lashing out when the pressure is on.

In the gallery above, CNN looks back through the years to unearth the 10 most extreme examples of tennis tantrums.

From angry Americans, raging Russians, bolshy Brits and surly Serbians, on-court etiquette is not always what it should be in men's and women's professional ranks.
