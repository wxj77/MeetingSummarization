(CNN) -- Louisville, Kentucky, police say a woman gave birth in the bathroom of the Kohl's clothing store where she worked, then left the newborn girl in a trash can where another worker later found the child dead.

Jessica Price, 29, is charged with murder, abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence in the August 8 death of the baby.

"We believe the baby was born alive and would be alive today if she had provided basic care for the baby," Louisville police Lt. Todd Kessinger said, according to CNN affiliate WLKY-TV.

According to Kessinger, Price went into the bathroom during her shift, then left for two hours, WLKY reported. When she came back to work, police were already on the scene after being summoned by store officials.

"The baby was discovered by another Kohl's worker. He went into the bathroom to change the trash bags and found the baby inside," WLKY quoted Kessinger as saying.

Price, who remained jailed Friday pending an August 26 court appearance, told investigators she had concealed the pregnancy and gave birth at the store, Kessenger said, according to WLKY.

What authorities didn't say is why.

Kentucky has a state law allowing parents of newborns to give up unwanted babies at hospital emergency rooms, police stations and fire stations, according to CNN affiliate WHAS-TV.
