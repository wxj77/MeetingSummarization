(CNN) -- Asia's emergence as a golfing power has received a boost with the announcement the continent's top golfers will face off against their European counterparts in a competition similar to the Ryder Cup.

The EurAsia Cup will be held every two years, with the inaugural event taking place at Malaysia's Glenmarie Golf and Country Club in March 2014

Two 10-man teams go head-to-head. Europe's team will be comprised of the tour four players from the European Tour's Race to Dubai standings, the leading four available players from the world rankings and two captain's picks.

The four top players from the Asian Tour's Order of Merit, the four available leading Asian players from the world rankings and two captain's picks will make up the Asian team.

Team captains will be announced at a later date.

"We are all excited by the prospect of this matchplay event between Europe and Asia," European Tour COO Keith Waters said in a statement.

"It will be a fantastic event showcasing world-class golf at the highest standard as matchplay competitions always bring out great excitement and drama for golf fans and television viewers," declared Asian Tour chairman Kyi Hla Han.

The European Tour's statement went on to say the competition "will be beamed live to more than 45 countries and 670 million homes."

The Ryder Cup is a biennial match played between Europe and the United States.

The intercontinental rivalry is one of the oldest in sport. The competition dates back to 1927 and was most recently held at the Medinah Country Club in Illinois, with Europe retaining the trophy.
