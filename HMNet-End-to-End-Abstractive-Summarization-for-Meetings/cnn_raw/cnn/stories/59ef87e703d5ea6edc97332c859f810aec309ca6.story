Paris (CNN) -- Paris was no paradise city for Axl Rose: about $200,000 worth of his jewelry was stolen when Guns n' Roses played a show there Tuesday night, police said Wednesday.

The jewelry was stolen from a lounge guarded by the frontman's personal security team, police said.

Only invited guests and members of Rose's entourage were allowed into the area, they said. Police did not say what items were taken.

A police investigation is under way.

Neither Axl Rose nor the band had an immediate comment on the theft.

Guns n' Roses is touring Europe through late July.
