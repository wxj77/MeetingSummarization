(Budget Travel) -- Baggage fees don't have to be a fait accompli. If you arm yourself with the right lightweight carry-ons (plus a few smart supplements), you'll be able to bring more on board -- and you might even skirt that two-bag limit.

FOR FAMILY FLIERS

Roller: Leave it to Jeep to design a rugged piece of luggage. Made from the same sturdy plastic as the company's car parts, the 20-inch Battalion bag can take whatever the kids dish out. ebags.com, $200.

Tote: The grown-up pattern of LeSportsac's ripstop-nylon Ryan Baby Bag ensures it will be your go-to shoulder bag long after you've survived the terrible twos. lesportsac.com, $128.

Budget Travel: The coolest small towns in America

Kiddy roller: A frog-shaped Ecogear Ecozoo roller should inspire Junior to pull his own weight (at least down the jetway.) ecogear-products.com, $50.

FOR AIR-TRAVEL AFICIONADOS

Roller: Delsey's new 21-inch Helium Fusion Lite 2.0 delivers in all the right ways: It's light all right -- just over nine pounds -- travels on inline-skate wheels, and can expand by two inches. macys.com, $90.

Budget Travel: World's weirdest hotels

Laptop case: For all it's built to hold (a laptop, power cords, a mouse, and file folders,) it's a wonder Case Logic's 14.5-inch nylon Laptop Attaché doesn't cast a bulkier shadow. caselogic.com, $30.

Backpack: The Reisenthel Mini Maxi rucksack zips into a wallet-size pouch that you can tuck into your suitcase for later use. reuseit.com, $18.
