Atlanta (CNN) -- Authorities are investigating the death of a Georgia state trooper late Monday after he was shot following a traffic stop in northwest Atlanta, an agency spokesman said.

A suspect has been arrested, said spokesman Gordy Wright.

Trooper Chadwick LeCroy, 38, who was shot twice in the face, died while being transported to a local trauma unit, Wright said.

The suspect escaped in the trooper's patrol car, which was found abandoned about half a mile away. The suspect was taken into custody with help from the Cobb County Police.

LeCroy, of Marietta, is survived by his wife and two sons, ages 8 and 21. He became a trooper in August 2008.

The killing is being investigated by the Georgia State Patrol, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Atlanta Police and Cobb County Police.
