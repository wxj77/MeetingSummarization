The gold -- no, scratch that -- platinum envelopes have been opened to reveal Condé Nast Traveler's 18th annual "hot list," highlighting what it says are the best hotels to debut in the past year.

Editors from the luxury vacation mag examined hundreds of swanky venues from Beijing to the Big Apple to pinpoint their favorites, a tough job after which they likely deserve a well-earned vacation.

This year's list of 33 finalists is described as the most selective ever.

It certainly seems that way -- in 2013 no fewer than 154 were chosen.

Some 510 hotels from 400 cities and 93 countries were scored for "sense of place," "personality" and "intuition" -- which apparently means meeting your needs before you know what your needs are.

The venues were split into seven categories, including the best beach hotels, family hotels, design hotels and "way-out-there" remote hotels.

The list also celebrates "over-the-top" establishments, such as Venice's Amal Canal Grande.

It also includes "bargain hotels" -- but this being Condé Nast Traveler, slumming it means you still won't get much change out of $300 a night.
