(CNN) -- Jeremy Renner is now a married man.

The actor's rep confirms Renner has tied the knot with actress and model Sonni Pacheco.

Renner, 43, welcomed a daughter with Pacheco in March 2013, but has kept their marriage quiet. He first revealed the news during a recent interview with Capitol File magazine.

"I have tried to protect my family's privacy, my wife's privacy. I don't need her to get hammered with my life," Renner explained about why he kept his marriage under wraps. "Privacy issues are important because I want her to go about her day without being bothered."

While he's not trying to publicize his wedded status, the "Kill the Messenger" star and producer isn't trying to hide the news either. Renner was seen wearing a wedding band at a screening of his upcoming movie in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.

As he told Capitol File magazine, Renner doesn't mind being followed by the paparazzi. It's just that "it's annoying being followed when I'm with my family," he went on. "It's not just me -- everyone [in Hollywood] has to deal with that."

Paparazzi stress aside, Renner added that he's really taken to fatherhood.

"I really love being a father. The only thing that has changed is my perspective on things," he said. "I still work, probably even more. It used to be for myself so I'm not old and broke. All these things I still do, but I do it now for the future of my baby, and if it gets in the way of her well-being, then I stop."
