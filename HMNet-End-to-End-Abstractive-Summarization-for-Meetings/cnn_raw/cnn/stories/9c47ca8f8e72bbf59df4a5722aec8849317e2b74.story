(CNN) -- Everton held on to their mantle as the only unbeaten team in the Premier League this season with a 3-2 win over Newcastle.

Romelu Lukaku was a livewire on his home debut for the Liverpool club, scoring twice and setting up English teenager Ross Barkley for Everton's second.

The 20 year old Belgian, who is on a season long loan from Chelsea, signalled to his compatriot Kevin Mirallas that he wanted the ball in the box with less than five minutes on the clock.

Mirallas duly delivered and Lukaku dinked it in to set Everton on their way.

The ball travelled from one end to the other for Lukaku's second in a perfect example of the much aligned long ball football.

Everton keeper Tim Howard sent the ball sailing up field and Lukaku got on the end of the American's mammoth kick to slide the ball past a flailing Tim Krul.

Try as he might the hat trick did not come for Lukaku as Newcastle pegged back the home side in the second half.

Substitute Yohan Cabaye conjured a wonderful strike from range to close the gap before fellow France international Loic Remy stabbed in the ball for a second with 88 minutes on the clock.

It was a nervy finish for Everton as Remy came close to grabbing the equalizer but the home side held on.

Roberto Martinez's team moved up to fourth in the table while Newcastle continue to hover near the relegation zone.
