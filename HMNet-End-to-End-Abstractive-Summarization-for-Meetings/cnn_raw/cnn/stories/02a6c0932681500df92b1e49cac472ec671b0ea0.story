(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius will once again don the blade-shaped prosthetic legs, which he has made famous, and dash around a track, his family said.

But the Olympic athlete charged with premeditated murder for the shooting death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, is not training to compete again.

He is running for the sake of his emotional health, the statement said.

"His focus at this time remains entirely on the court case," the family said Thursday. They have pushed him to spend time on the track in hopes it will help him "process his trauma and prepare for the trial."

Pistorius is scheduled to appear in court again on August 19, which would have been Steenkamp's 30th birthday.

The double amputee track star killed the woman he calls the love of his life on Valentine's Day in his apartment. He says he mistook her for a home invader.
