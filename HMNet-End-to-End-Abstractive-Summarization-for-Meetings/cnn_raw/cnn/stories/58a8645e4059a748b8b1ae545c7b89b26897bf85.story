The Costa Concordia struck rocks in shallow water off Italy's western coast on Friday, killing at least three people, injuring 20 and leaving dozens unaccounted for. Here are five facts about the cruise ship:

1. The Concordia is owned by Genoa-based Costa Cruises. It was christened in 2006, at which point the ship was believed to be the largest cruise ship flying the Italian flag.

2. The ship weighs in at more than 114,000 gross tonnage and measures 951 feet in length. Its maximum speed was designed to be 23 knots.

3. Among the amenities on board: a wellness center, five restaurants, 13 bars, four swimming pools and a giant movie screen. The ship has 1,500 cabins.

4. Its name -- Concordia -- is Italian for concord, or harmony.

5. About 4,200 people were on board the ship when it ran aground. Most of the passengers were Italian, as well as some French and German citizens. CNN affiliate America Noticias, in Peru, said a group of 32 Peruvians were also onboard. Brazil's state-run Agencia Brasil said 53 Brazilians were on the cruise ship. An estimated 126 Americans were also on board, according to the U.S. State Department.
