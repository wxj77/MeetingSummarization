Kris Jenner made official what has been speculated for months -- that her marriage to Bruce Jenner is over.

The Kardashian family matriarch cited "irreconcilable differences" with her husband of 23 years in a divorce petition filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court Monday.

Kris Jenner, 58, is offering joint custody of their only minor child, 17-year-old Kylie, but she wants to keep all of her earnings since their legal separation on June 1, 2013, according to the court document.  Her petition opposes any spousal support from her to him.

The split is no surprise, since the reality TV couple publicly acknowledged their separation last year.

"We will always have much love and respect for each other," the pair said in a  joint statement when they announced the separation last year. "Even though we are separated, we will always remain best friends and, as always, our family will remain our No. 1 priority."

Former Olympian Bruce Jenner, 64, told People magazine last October that he may be "happier" living separately, but that didn't mean they're would divorce.

Both continued work on the family's E! reality show "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" despite their separation.

Bruce Jenner gained fame when he won the decathlon gold medal at the 1976 summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada.

Kris Jenner is famous because she gave the world Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Rob Kardashian during her marriage to O.J. Simpson's lawyer, the late Robert Kardashian; and Kendall and Kylie Jenner from her now-ending marriage.
