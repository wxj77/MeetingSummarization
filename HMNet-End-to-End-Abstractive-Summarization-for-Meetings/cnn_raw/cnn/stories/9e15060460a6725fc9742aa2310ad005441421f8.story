(CNN) -- A Dutch court Friday ruled against letting a 14-year-old girl sail solo around the world, saying she is not experienced enough to make the trip on her own.

Laura Dekker would be allowed to travel from July 1 of next year if she fulfills certain requirements the court established for her to sail.

In August, Dutch authorities placed Dekker under state care for two months, following her parents' refusal to prevent her from undertaking the potentially dangerous voyage.

Dekker is seeking to become the youngest person to sail solo around the world.

The current record holder is 17-year-old British teenager Mike Perham who completed his nine-month voyage in August.
