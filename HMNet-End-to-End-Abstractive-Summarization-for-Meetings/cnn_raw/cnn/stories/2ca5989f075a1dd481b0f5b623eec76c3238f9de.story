Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Kabul's police chief and chief of criminal investigations have submitted their resignations to the Afghan Interior Ministry, but the ministry ordered them to complete their probe into Friday's suicide attacks first, a ministry spokesman told CNN.

The ministry has not yet approved the resignations of Police Chief Abdul Rahman Rahman and investigations chief Abdul Ghafar Sayed Zada, spokesman Ezmary Bashari said.

The two were ordered to continue their investigation into deadly blasts that targeted foreigners in the capital city Friday. At least 17 people were killed and many others wounded.

Once the investigation into the bombings is complete, the minister of interior will make a decision on the resignations, Bashari said.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attacks near the Safi Landmark Hotel in the Shahr-E-Naw neighborhood of Kabul. A number of government and United Nations offices are located there, as well as supermarkets, banks, diplomatic facilities and villas for well-to-do Afghans.

An employee at a Kabul hospital said eight Indians and one Pakistani were among the dead. Interior Ministry officials said an Italian was killed, and the Indian embassy said four Indians were killed.

The attack started with a suicide car bomb and four suicide bombers with explosive-laden vests, said Taliban spokesman Zaidullah Mujahid. Three of the bombers were killed, he said.

About 20 minutes later, a second large explosion occurred.

Journalist Matiullah Mati and CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.
