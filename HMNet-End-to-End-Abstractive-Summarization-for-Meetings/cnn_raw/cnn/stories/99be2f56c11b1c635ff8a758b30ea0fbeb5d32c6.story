(CNN) -- Senegal claimed the 16th and final place in the Olympic men's soccer tournament after a 2-0 win over Oman in Monday's playoff in England.

Ibrahima Balde headed the African side ahead after just 90 seconds but Senegal did not seal the win until two minutes from the end when substitute Abdoulaye Sane scored the second goal.

A crowd of more than 11,500 turned out to watch the game at the Ricoh Arena, which will be known as the City of Coventry Stadium when it hosts matches during the Olympics.

The draw for the tournament takes place in London on Tuesday.

Senegal finished fourth in the African Under-23 Championship to qualify for the playoff, while Oman won a three-team Asian tournament. Both teams were looking to qualify for the Olympics for the first time.

Senegal could have had more goals to show for their superiority in the first half, but striker Kalidou Yero wasted several chances and Oman keeper Omar Al Abri saved from Sadio Mane and Moussa Konate.

Oman, coached by Frenchman Paul Le Guen, threatened more in the second half. Waleed Al Saadi had a shot deflected behind and Mohammed Al Balushi shot narrowly wide from the resulting corner.

And as Oman committed more numbers to attack, Senegal settled the result on the counterattack when Sane escaped down the right and shot past Al Abri.

Senegal joined fellow African sides Gabon, Morocco and Egypt in the men's tournament which begins July 26 with the opening matches at Hampden Park, Glasgow.

Brazil, Spain, Mexico and hosts Great Britain have been seeded and will be kept apart in the draw for the group stage.
