Today's coverage begins with a pair of presidential proposals, including an executive order and a suggestion to mandate voting. Then, science takes over in reports on celestial events, extraordinary auroras, and miniature satellites that are mapping our world. We'll feature a random segment involving rats and Mozart, and we'll show you a car that literally can fly.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
