(CNN) -- Trader Joe's has alerted its customers about the recall of products with a cilantro ingredient that may cause a serious foodborne illness.

In some cases, the affected items are specific to certain states.

For example, the 12-ounce, Spicy Thai Style Pasta Salad (sku 74441), was recalled by APPA Fine Foods, which supplied the product to California Trader Joe's, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.

The pasta salad, which has sell-by dates of October 31 through November 6, contains cilantro that may be contaminated with salmonella, the government said.

The packages bear the establishment number "P-21030" within the USDA mark of inspection.

There have been no reports of any illnesses so far, CNN affiliate KTLA reported.

Symptoms of salmonella poisoning can include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Those with weak immune systems, like infants and the elderly, are the most susceptible.

Trader Joe's also voluntarily recalled the following products it says should not be consumed due to the potential for "serious foodborne illness." The company did not describe the illness:

All stores: Cilantro Dressing (sku 36420) with a sell-by date of February 9, 2011; Spicy Peanut Vinaigrette (sku 80947) with a sell-by date of January 9, 2011.

California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon and Washington only: Cilantro Pecan Dip (sku 76986) with sell-by dates of November 20 and November 24.

As a precaution, all codes of the products have been removed from sale and destroyed, Trader Joe's said. The chain advises customers to dispose of the affected products or return them to any store location for a full refund.
