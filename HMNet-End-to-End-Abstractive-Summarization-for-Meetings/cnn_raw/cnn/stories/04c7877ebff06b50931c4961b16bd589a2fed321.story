(CNN) -- A riot at a Texas detention center was ended Sunday. One prison building was heavily damaged, and about 700 inmates were going to spend the night in tents, authorities said.

The disturbance began Saturday at the Reeves County Detention Center near Pecos in west Texas, and hundreds of inmates continued rioting overnight in the second such incident at the facility in less than two months.

April Orsoco with the Reeves County Sheriff's Office said the office was notified by the prison about 4 p.m. Sunday that "they got it under control." Orsoco did not have details on how the situation ended, but she said no injuries were reported as the incident ended.

The office reported it had no explanation for the rioting.

Three inmates were hospitalized Saturday after fighting began, one with a severed finger, according to the sheriff's office.

In addition to prison personnel, sheriff's deputies and officers from several other agencies remained at the facility Sunday night.

With one of three buildings at the detention center damaged extensively in the rioting, "the warden is trying to figure out where [the prison] can house the inmates," Orsoco said.

She said the tents were set up on prison grounds, and inmates would be transferred to other prison facilities on Monday so damage could be repaired.

The prison is a 2,400-bed, low-security facility, operated by Geo Group Inc. It houses federal prisoners as well as inmates from other states.

As many as 2,000 inmates from two of the center's three buildings began fighting in the prison yard about 4:30 p.m. Saturday, according to the sheriff's office. The center is about 430 miles from Dallas, Texas.

On December 12, inmates took two workers hostage and set fire to the recreation area. Those inmates surrendered later that night.
