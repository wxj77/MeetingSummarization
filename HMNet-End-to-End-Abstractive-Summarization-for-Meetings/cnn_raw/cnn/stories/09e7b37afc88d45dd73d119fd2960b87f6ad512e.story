(CNN Student News) -- February 5, 2014

A great deal of technology goes into today's show. It's included in reports on high-speed Internet access, a massive social media company, and a proposal for cars to "talk" to one another. We also discuss yet another winter wallop for parts of the U.S., and we examine the details of an airplane that'll probably never fly.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.
