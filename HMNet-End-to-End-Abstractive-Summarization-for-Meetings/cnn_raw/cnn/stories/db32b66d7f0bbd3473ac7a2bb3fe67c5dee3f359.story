(EW.com) -- News already broke this week that Ricky Martin was going to appear on "Glee" this winter as McKinley High's new Spanish teacher.

But now EW has even more exciting news for Latin music fans: A source exclusively tells EW that pop superstar Gloria Estefan is currently in negotiations to play [SPOILER ALERT!!!]... Santana's mother!

Last night, we met Santana's grandmother, who did not approve of her granddaughter's lesbian lifestyle. But we haven't heard from her parents, who Santana claimed were supportive of their daughter's coming out.

Gleeks should expect to see Gloria in the same episode as Martin in January. Our source tells us that the entire cast is "really really big fans of hers and we love her music and her husband's music." In fact, the plan is for the episode is to feature some of Estefan's own music as well as some other bilingual tunes.
