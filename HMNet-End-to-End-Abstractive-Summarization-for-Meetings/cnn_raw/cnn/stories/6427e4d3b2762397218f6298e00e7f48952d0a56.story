(CNN Student News) -- November 13, 2014

As a lame duck session gets started in the U.S. Congress, we're defining what that means, telling you what's ahead for lawmakers, and reporting on how a controversy surrounding immigration may factor in. We're also looking at the issue of diplomacy today: What role did it play in a presidential trip to China? How might spending time abroad help students learn lessons in diplomacy? It's all included on this Thursday's show!

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
