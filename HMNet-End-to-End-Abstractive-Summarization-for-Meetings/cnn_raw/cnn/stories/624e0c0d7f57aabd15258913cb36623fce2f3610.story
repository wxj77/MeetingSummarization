(CNN) -- Monday night's third and final presidential debate was a bittersweet occasion for the Twittersphere. The previous two presidential debates, and one equally entertaining vice presidential debate, have provided rich material for the wits of Twitter. Their rapid-fire commentary turned what could have been dry television into deeply entertaining multi-screen experiences. As many pointed out on Twitter, the micro-blogging service is like Mystery Science Theater for live television.

This debate, which took place at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida, is the last for the current election cycle, which will end when voters go to the polls on November 6.

The meme of the evening did not stem out of one candidate's gaffe, but from a well-executed zinger (the words "gaffe" and "zinger" will officially be retired on November 7). Responding to a criticism from Romney about the size of the U.S. Navy, Obama said: "You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them."

Obama foreceful in final debate, Romney plays defense

The hashtag #horsesandbayonettes and parody account @Horsesbayonette quickly followed. Other popular moments included moderator Bob Schieffer slipping up and saying "Obama bin Laden," the repeated use of the word "tumult" and whether or not the U.S. should "divorce" Pakistan.

The volume of tweets was a bit lower this round, with 6.5 million tweets sent during the hour and a half event, according to Twitter. The previous debate had 7.2 million tweets, the first 10 million (a record for a U.S. political event).
