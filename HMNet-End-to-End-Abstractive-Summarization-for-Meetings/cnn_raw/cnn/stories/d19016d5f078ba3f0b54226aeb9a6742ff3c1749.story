(EW.com ) -- Bravo had a good year in 2013 — so good that the network is adding an ambitious 15 new original shows to its programming.

Famous for hits like the "Real Housewives" series, Bravo earned the No. 1 spot in 2013 for the most engaged, educated, and affluent viewers for the 18-49 age group in prime time, and it's now averaging 1.1 million total viewers.

"Our strategy of creating a total multi-platform lifestyle experience for our Affluencers is paying off with not just viewership growth across the board, but also loyalty, which is at an all-time high for Bravo," Bravo president Frances Berwick said in a statement. "This diversified new lineup, which includes two scripted series and our first 'real-time' docu-series, will satisfy fans and also bring in new affluent viewers."

See what new shows Bravo has in store below, along with what series will be returning:
