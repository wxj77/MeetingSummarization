(CNN) -- Sprint superstar Usain Bolt was beaten by fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake for the second time in 48 hours on Sunday as he was pipped to first place in the 200m final at the Caribbean nation's Olympic trials.

The 22-year-old Blake, who clocked a time of 9.75 secs to beat Bolt over 100m on Friday, crossed the line in 19.80 secs in Kingston -- 0.03 secs ahead of his rival.

Back-to-back defeats for three-time Olympic gold medalist Bolt, the world record holder over 100 and 200m, have increased the pressure on the 25-year-old ahead of the London 2012 Games -- which start on July 27.

"I can never be discouraged," the 25-year-old Bolt told reporters after the race. "I'm never worried until my coach gets worried. My coach isn't worried, so I'm OK," he added, referring to the Jamaican sprinter's coach Glen Mills.

When asked if he had anything to prove heading into his third Games, Bolt replied: "I would say definitely. I'm the Olympic champion, so I have to show the world that I'm the best.

"I expect to come back. Three more weeks should be enough to get myself back into shape."

For Blake, who recorded the year's leading time over 200m and a personal best in Friday's 100m, it marks another significant step in his rise to prominence after clinching World Championship 100m gold in Daegu, South Korea last year, after Bolt was disqualified from the final after a false start.

Bolt and Blake are the two fastest men of all time over 200m, with the former's time of 19.19 secs the current world record.

The duo will be hoping to meet again in the 100m final at London's Olympic Stadium on August 5 and the 200m showpiece on August 9.

Former 100m world-record Asafa Powell and Warren Weir in the 200m complete the Jamaican line-up for the individual sprint disciplines.

Three years ago Bolt set the 100m world record after running 9.58 secs at the World Championships.
