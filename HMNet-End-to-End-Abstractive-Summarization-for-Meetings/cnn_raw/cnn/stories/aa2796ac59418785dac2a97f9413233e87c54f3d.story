(CNN) -- This is the second-straight Republican National Convention disrupted by storms. Four years ago, Republicans gathering in Minneapolis delayed the political revelry to focus on disaster relief from Hurricane Gustav, which hit Louisiana. This year, the event was closer to the weather action also targeting Gulf Coast states. Tropical Storm Isaac skirted western Florida on Monday but was expected to strengthen into a hurricane. Headliners at the Tampa convention were pushed back a day to Tuesday with the nomination of Mitt Romney still on schedule for Thursday.
