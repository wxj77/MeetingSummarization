(CNN) -- Costa Rica has taken its border dispute with Nicaragua to international court, repeating claims that its territory has been invaded.

In a statement Thursday, Costa Rica's foreign ministry said the country had filed a lawsuit at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, to end a situation that "threatens imminent and irreparable harm" to Costa Rica.

The suit asks the court to stop "the construction of a canal on Costa Rican soil," according to the statement.

Tensions between Nicaragua and Costa Rica have flared over Calero Island, a parcel of land on the Atlantic coast. Nicaragua  denies its troops are in Costa Rican territory. Costa Rica claims it has  been invaded.

Costa Rica claims that in addition to the Nicaraguan troops, a dredging  project in the river is dumping sediment on its side of the border, and that a  Costa Rican flag in the area was replaced with a Nicaraguan flag.

Nicaragua has accused Costa Rica of breaking diplomatic relations between  the countries.

Also Thursday, the Organization of American States approved a resolution convening a meeting of ministers of foreign affairs to discuss the situation on December 7.
