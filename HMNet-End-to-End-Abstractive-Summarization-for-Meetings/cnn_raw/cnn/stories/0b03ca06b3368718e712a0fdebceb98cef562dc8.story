(CNN) -- Real Madrid came from behind to beat cross-city rivals Atletico 3-1 in the first leg of their Copa Del Rey quarterfinal tie at the Santiago Bernabeu on Thursday.

Real fell behind to a goal from Uruguay's Diego Forlan after seven minutes before defender Sergio Ramos headed an equalizer for the home team six minutes later.

Cristiano Ronaldo followed up his hat-trick against Villarreal on Saturday with Los Blancos' second goal on the hour mark, before Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil sealed the victory with Real's third one minute from time.

Real head coach Jose Mourinho was pleased his team were able to find a third goal, but warned against complacency ahead of the second leg at Atletico's Vicente Calderon Stadium on January 20.

Why were EPL players snubbed in all-star selection?

"It is very important to reach the second leg with the advantage," Mourinho told the club's official website.

"The third goal gives us a little peace of mind, but we still have to play another 90 minutes in the Vicente Calderon, where Atletico are very strong. The outcome is still undecided."

In Thursday's other tie, Spanish Primera Liga strugglers Almeria claimed a 1-0 victory at home to Deportivo La Coruna.

The match at Estadio del Mediterraneo was settled by an own goal from Deportivo's Norwegian defender Knut Olav Rindaroy after 34 minutes.

The second leg will be played at Deportivo's Riazor stadium on January 19.
