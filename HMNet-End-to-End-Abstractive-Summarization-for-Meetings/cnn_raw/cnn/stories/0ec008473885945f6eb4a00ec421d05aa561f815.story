(CNN)A U.S. Navy SEAL was killed in a parachute accident in Perris, California, near Riverside, a U.S. Navy official told CNN on Wednesday.

He was identified Thursday as Special Warfare Operator 3rd Class Jason Kortz, 29, of Highlands Ranch, Colorado.

"Jason distinguished himself consistently throughout his career. He was the epitome of  the quiet professional in all facets of his life, and he leaves an inspiring legacy of natural  tenacity and focused commitment for posterity," the Navy said in a news release.

Kortz joined the SEALs in September after enlisting in the Navy two years earlier. He was married, the Navy said.

Initial indications are the parachute failed to open during a jump as part of a training exercise. Kortz was part of a West Coast-based Navy SEAL team.
