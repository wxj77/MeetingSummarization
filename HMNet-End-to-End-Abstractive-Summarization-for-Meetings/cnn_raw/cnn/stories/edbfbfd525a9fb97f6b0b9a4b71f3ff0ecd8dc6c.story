(EW.com) -- Actress Jeanne Cooper — star of "The Young and the Restless," which earned 23 nominations this morning from the Daytime Emmys — has returned to the hospital due to an undisclosed illness. Cooper, 84, was recently discharged after spending several weeks in treatment, but her son Corbin Bernsen posted on Facebook that a return was necessary.

"Not sure what to pray for at this point or what we even want for her," Bernsen wrote. "I know in my heart there is more for her to do in this world, but I also know there is a season for all things. I want more than anything comfort for her. I want her to have peace. This is that tricky place where you start to weight all things, not what we need to do, actions to take, but instead open ourselves for enlightenment as to what God has planned for her and ultimately what is best for her. She is a fighter and I know she'll continue that. But when you're a boxer in the corner, bruised and bloodies from battle and demands to keep going, what do you do? I'm saying my prayers this morning, asking for guidance."

John Grisham writes 'A Time to Kill' sequel

Cooper's absence has not affected the soap. In fact, her character, Katherine Chancellor appeared in today's episode.

Cooper has been on the CBS soap since 1973.
