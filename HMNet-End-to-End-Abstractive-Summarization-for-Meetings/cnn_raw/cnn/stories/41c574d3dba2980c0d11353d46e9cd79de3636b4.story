(CNN) -- A Red Sox star used blue language, but he won't be fined any green for his emotional reaction the day after police captured marathon bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev.

To the contrary, longtime Boston icon David "Big Papi" Ortiz's use of profanity has been Federal Communications Commission-approved.

In a ceremony before the Red Sox took on the Kansas City Royals at a packed Fenway Park on Saturday, Ortiz threw out the F-word while delivering an inspirational message over the baseball stadium's loudspeakers.

"This jersey, that we wear today, it doesn't say 'Red Sox.' It says 'Boston,' " Ortiz said, standing on the infield as the crowd cheered officers who were on the field.

"We want to thank you Mayor Menino, Governor Patrick, the whole police department, for the great job that they did this past week. This is our f***ing city. And nobody's going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong," he said.

While the FCC has pursued others for broadcast profanity -- most notably, FOX Television Stations for expletives dropped during live awards shows in 2002 and 2003 -- FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski gave Ortiz a free pass Saturday.

He tweeted: "David Ortiz spoke from the heart at today's Red Sox game. I stand with Big Papi and the people of Boston - Julius."

The Red Sox had canceled Friday night's game with the Royals, as the massive manhunt for Tsarnaev shut down much of the Boston metropolitan area.
