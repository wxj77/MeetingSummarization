(CNN) -- The first film adaptation of Veronica Roth's "Divergent" novels was one of the most popular new Hollywood franchises of 2014, grossing more than $150 million at the domestic box office.

Now, fans can close out the year with a look at the much-anticipated sequel, "Insurgent," which is due out March 2015.

Shailene Woodley reprises the role of Tris, a teen living in a dystopian future where people are divided into categories based on character attributes. Tris and her fellow "divergents," who don't fit into any of the categories, continue their struggle to survive as Jeanine Matthews (played by Kate Winslet) hunts them down.

A trailer released this week shows a greater emphasis on action scenes this go-around. Fans of the trilogy might also notice that Tris has a pixie cut in this installment, even though the character's hair is not that short in the book.

Woodley says director Robert Schwentke granted her request to keep her naturally short hair -- which she cut for her role in another young adult novel adaptation, "The Fault in Our Stars" -- instead of wearing a wig.

"I think wigs always look wiggy, especially in an action movie," Woodley told Buzzfeed.

What do you think of the new trailer? Will you go back for part two?
