(CNN) -- A speedboat carrying Britain's Prince Harry broke down in the Bahamas, but that didn't slow the royal down during his Caribbean tour.

Prince Harry boarded a media boat after a mechanical failure stopped the Royal Bahamas Defence Force boat he was riding to Harbour Island on Sunday.

Throngs of cheering crowds met him on the island, which the 27-year-old son of Prince Charles and Diana visited as part of a tour celebrating the 60th anniversary of his grandmother's accession to the throne.

Island resident India Hicks, a bridesmaid in his parents' wedding, helped show him around the normally sleepy enclave.

Prince Harry's Diamond Jubilee celebrations began Friday in the Belize capital Belmopan, where the prince danced and drank in a street party along the newly named HM Queen Elizabeth II Boulevard.

The prince had a quieter day in Belize Saturday, climbing to the top of Xunantunich, a Mayan temple.

He toured an open-air exhibit in Nassau's Rawson Square before boarding the speedboat Sunday.

After a youth rally in the Bahamas National Stadium on Monday, Prince Harry was scheduled to travel to Jamaica and then on to Brazil to complete his 10-day tour.

Diamond Jubilee celebrations marking six decades on the throne for Queen Elizabeth II officially began last month and continue through June, when London will mark the anniversary of her coronation with festivities including up to 1,000 boats sailing up the River Thames.

The 85-year-old monarch has no political power, but she has immense power as a figurehead. She is officially the head of state of 16 countries that used to be part of the British Empire, including the Bahamas.
