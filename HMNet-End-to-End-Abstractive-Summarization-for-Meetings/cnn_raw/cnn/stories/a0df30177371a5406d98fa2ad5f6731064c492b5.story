(CNN) -- Juan Martin Del Potro has begun training again, raising hopes he may be fit to defend his U.S Open title at Flushing Meadows later this month.

The Argentinean has been out of action since the Australian Open in January after having surgery on his right wrist but was included in the list of entrants for the New York tournament, which starts on August 30.

He denied a rumor last month that he was already back on the court, but a picture posted on Del Potro's Twitter account showed the 21-year-old practicing again - racquet in hand.

He wrote: "How beautiful it is to come back and hit the ball, I can tell you it was a light session but I had the racquet in my hand once again."

Del Potro had been battling with his injury for a long time before opting to go under the knife after his fourth round defeat by Marian Cilic at the Australian Open.

His solid form last season led to him climbing to number four in the rankings, largely thanks to landing his maiden major title at the U.S. Open.

Del Potro beat Rafael Nadal in the semifinal before he denied Roger Federer a sixth straight title by beating the then world number one in a five set thriller.

After that he made the final of the season-ending Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in London but fell to Nikolay Davydenko in the final, before his fourth round exit in Melbourne.

Del Potro has already confirmed he will play in the Thailand Open in September, but now he faces a race against time to regain full fitness before the U.S. Open begins.
