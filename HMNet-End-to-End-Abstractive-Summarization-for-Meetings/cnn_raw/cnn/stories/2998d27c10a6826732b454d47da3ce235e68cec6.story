(CNN) -- A producer of bagged salad leaves has issued a voluntary recall of various salad blends over concerns they may be contaminated with salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration announced.

Taylor Farms Retail of California is recalling 3,265 cases of salads following a random test on a finished package of spinach by the Washington State Department of Agriculture, the FDA said.

There have been no reported illnesses attributed to the recalled items, according to the FDA.

The products were distributed in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Puerto Rico and sold in various retail supermarkets, the FDA said.

The recall affects several salad blends under the brands Fresh Selections, H-E-B, Marketside, and Taylor Farms. The products have "best by" dates of between October 18 and 21.

The FDA says salmonella is a bacteria that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy people may experience fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea that may be bloody.

In rare cases, the organism can get into the bloodstream and cause more serious complications.
