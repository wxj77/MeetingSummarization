(CNN) -- Kim Clijsters has regained the WTA Tour Championship title, seven years after last winning it, after a hard-fought three-set victory over Caroline Wozniacki in Doha, Qatar on Sunday.

Belgian Clijsters, who was lifting the trophy for a third time following back-to-back wins in 2002 and 2003, beat world number one Wozniacki 6-3 5-7 6-3 in a thrilling two hour and 20 minute clash.

It marked a remarkable return for 27-year-old Clijsters, who was appearing in her first tournament since retaining her U.S. Open title seven weeks ago, following a foot operation.

Is Wozniacki a worthy world number one?

"It was a very tough battle, and I think it was a fine advert for women's tennis," Clijsters told reporters.

"I'm glad I won but I don't know how many more years I will play --and I think Caroline has a great future ahead of her," added Clijsters.

Dane Wozniacki, who will end the year as number one following six WTA Tour titles this season, said: "It was still a fantastic week for me.

"I would love to come back here, and I would love to try for this title once again."

Meanwhile, Sunday saw three ATP Tour finals take place around Europe with home favorite Gael Monfils claiming his third career title with a 6-2 5-7 6-1 win over Croatia's Ivan Ljubicic in the final of the inaugural Montpellier tournament.

World number 15 Monfils has been beaten in both of his two previous final appearances this year, in Stuttgart and Tokyo.

Elsewhere, top seed and world number 12 Jurgen Melzer fought back from the brink of defeat to see off fellow-Austrian Andreas Haider-Maurer 6-7 7-6 6-4 to win the Austria Tennis Trophy in Vienna for the second year in a row.

And there was a surprise in the final of the St Petersburg Open in Russia when unseeded Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan shocked top seed Mikhail Youzhny to win his maiden ATP title.

The 22-year-old from Astana completed a 6-3 7-6 victory after two hours and 25 minutes of play.
