Washington (CNN) -- A man has been arrested for making threats against Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, law enforcement officials said Thursday.

Anirruddha Sherbow was apprehended by Mexican law enforcement officers in Tijuana on Wednesday. The FBI and U.S. Capitol Police said Sherbow made threats against the Hawaii Democrat this month that were "deemed credible."

Officials would not describe the nature of any statements allegedly made by Sherbow involving the congresswoman, and court documents remain under seal.

According to the Hawaii Reporter, Sherbow, a former resident of Hawaii, sent an e-mail to the FBI threatening to decapitate Gabbard. That report also said Gabbard obtained a three-year restraining order against Sherbow in 2011.

Sherbow is facing a charge of transmission of threats in interstate commerce.

Mexican authorities turned Sherbow over to FBI agents in San Diego, where he is expected to have a court appearance on Friday.

Gabbard's press secretary, Heather Fluit, said the congresswoman was "grateful for the work of the U.S. Capitol Police, FBI and all law enforcement officers involved in this investigation."
