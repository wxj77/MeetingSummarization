Justin Bieber's neighbor accused the singer of spitting on him and making threats during a heated confrontation outside his California home Tuesday, a sheriff's spokesman said.

Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies are investigating the neighbor's battery complaint against Bieber, spokesman Steve Whitmore said.

Bieber's representative denied to deputies that the singer spat on or threatened the neighbor, Whitmore said.

A member of the singer's security personnel toldCNN there was no physical contact.

"The neighbor went onto Justin's property. They exchanged words. The neighbor has had issues before," the source said.

Investigators are also looking into the neighbor's complaint that Bieber drove his sports car at high speeds through the otherwise quiet streets of his gated Calabasas, California, community, Whitmore said.

Bieber had just returned to his California home Tuesday morning after performing in Europe.

Bieber, 19, moved into a $6.5 million mansion in The Oaks of Calabasas a year ago. The exclusive community is also home to Michael Jackson's mother and his three children.

The teen pop star went through similar brush with the law last May when a photographer filed a complaint with the sheriff accusing Bieber of misdemeanor battery.

That incident involved an alleged scuffle in the parking lot of a Calabasas shopping center.  The photographer said Bieber attacked him as he was taking photos of Bieber and his then-girlfriend, Selena Gomez.  Prosecutors declined to pursue the charge against Bieber in the case.
