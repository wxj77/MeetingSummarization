(CNN) -- Nikolai Valuev will face Ruslan Chagaev in their much-anticipated rematch for the WBA heavyweight title in Finland on May 30.

The bout, at Helsinki's Hartwall-Arena, will be the first-ever heavyweight contest on Finnish soil, and will see a pumped-up Valuev going all out to "settle the score" against the only man to defeat him in a 51-bout career.

Chagaev twice pulled out of scheduled rematches with Valuev last summer due to injury problems, prompting the WBA to vacate the title.

Uzbeki southpaw Chagaev has been listed as 'champion in recess' ever since and -- as a result -- has to fight Valuev by the end of June in order to determine the undisputed champion.

Valuev reclaimed the vacant belt by defeating American John Ruiz in August and defended his title against Evander Holyfield in December.

"The day has come to settle the score," Valuev told a news conference. "I have been waiting for two years to make amends. Only a victory over Chagaev can put my mind at rest."

Valuev bounced back with four wins on the spin following his loss to Chagaev in April 2007 but the Russian admits the only scalp that matters is that of the Uzbeki.

"I know everything there is to know about Chagaev," said Valuev. "This is the fourth time I am actually preparing for a fight with him," he added, referring to the two postponed fights last year.

"Now is the time to end all this confusion. There will only be one WBA heavyweight champion after May 30 -- and that will be me."
