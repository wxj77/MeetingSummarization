(CNN) -- Don't look for Mick Jagger and the boys to talk retirement anytime soon.

On Wednesday The Rolling Stones announced their "50 and Counting" tour which will kick off in Los Angeles at the Staples Center on a date to be determined. The tour will include shows in Oakland, San Jose, Las Vegas, Anaheim, Toronto, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia.

The group -- consisting of Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood -- have been rocking out for more than five decades. To celebrate their 50th anniversary last year the group did a few tour dates.

"50 and Counting" has been "pretty amazing so far," Jagger said in a statement. "We did a few shows in London and New York last year ... and had such a good time that we thought ... let's do some more. It's a good show."

Richards agreed.

"From day one at rehearsals it sounded so fresh," Richards said according to a press release about the tour. "You could tell that everybody was dying to get their teeth into it. It was like ... open the gates ... let us out! 'Cause man, it is the life and blood of us to play in front of people."

Mick Taylor, who was a member of the group from 1969-74, is set to perform with them as a special guest throughout the tour.

Tickets for the shows in Oakland, San Jose, Toronto and Chicago will go on sale to the general public April 8 and will also be available at Rollingstone.com.
