(CNN) -- A 22-story residential building collapsed in Colombia's second-largest city, killing one person, injuring two and leaving 10 others unaccounted for, authorities said Sunday.

The building collapsed Saturday night in Medellin, according to the office of Claudia Patricia Restrepo, the temporary mayor.

Officials evacuated 24 families from the building Friday after they noticed cracks.

Construction workers inside the building at the time of the collapse were among the missing, according to the mayor.

After the incident, authorities evacuated residents of nearby buildings as a security measure.

Restrepo said police, the fire department, psychologists and the Red Cross were at the site.
