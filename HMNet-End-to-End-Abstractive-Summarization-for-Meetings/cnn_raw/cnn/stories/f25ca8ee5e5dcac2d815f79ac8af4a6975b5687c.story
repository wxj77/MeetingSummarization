If you doubt there's an unwritten code of honor among criminals -- governing certain behavior that's just not permitted -- consider this:

Police say a burglar in southern Spain who stole an old Super 8 camera and tapes from a home discovered to his horror the graphic video content of a man sexually abusing boys.

The burglar put three tapes in a brown envelope, hid them under a parked car, and then called police from a public phone, directing them to go find it.

Inside the envelope, police found a note with the home address of the suspected pedophile and a message from the burglar:

"I've had the misfortune that these tapes have fallen into my hands and I feel obligated to turn them in so that you can do your job and put that (expletive) in prison for life."

Spanish national police confirmed Thursday they arrested a 64-year-old suspected child molester this week at his home -- the one that had been burglarized -- in the southern provincial capital of Jaen.

The suspect is a local football (soccer) coach who lived alone. He lured some of his young players into watching pornographic videos together, and then sexually abused them, police said.

Police have identified four minor boys who were victims of the alleged abuse, including a 16-year-old who may have been abused for six years.

The suspected pedophile had reported the burglary at his home to police, listing various electrical appliances that were stolen. But he didn't mention the camera or the tapes, police said.

At his home, police said they found other tapes with graphic content of sexual abuse of boys.

And yes, they're still looking for the burglar, the one "with a conscience," said a police officer in Jaen.
