(CNN) -- It's a good day for Real Madrid.

Not only has the 10-time European champion signed World Cup-winning star Toni Kroos, it's also been named the most valuable sports team on the planet.

Kroos, who starred during Germany's triumph in Brazil which culminated in a 1-0 win over Argentina in Sunday's final, penned a six-year deal Thursday after his transfer from Bayern Munich was completed in a reported $34 million deal.

Business magazine Forbes values Real at $3.4 billion, more than archrivals Barcelona and English giants Manchester United.

It suggests "Los Blancos" earned $78 million for its victorious European Champions League campaign -- Real beat city rival Atletico Madrid in the final -- contributing to an unrivaled total revenue of $675 million.

Barca, which recently completed the signing of Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez for a reported $128 million, is valued at $3.2 billion, while 20-time English champion United is worth $2.81 billion.

The only other European football team in the top 10 is Kroos' former club Bayern, which is ranked seventh on $1.85 billion.

Baseball's New York Yankees is fourth on the list ($2.5 billion,) with fellow Major League Baseball franchise the Los Angeles Dodgers at six with a total worth of $2 billion.

Four National Football League franchises feature in the top 10, with the Dallas Cowboys -- valued at $2.3 billion -- in fifth.

The New England Patriots ($1.8 billion,) Washington Red Skins ($1.7 billion) and New York Giants ($1.55 billion) are eighth, ninth and 10th respectively.
