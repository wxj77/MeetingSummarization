(CNN) -- It had to end some time.

The New York Knicks seven-game winning streak, sparked by the surprising play of Jeremy Lin, ended Friday.

Despite scoring 26 points against the New Orleans Hornets , Lin and the Knicks loss.

Lin, 23, who has played electrifying basketball in recent games, got off to a slow start Friday and was plagued by turnovers. After the game, Lin lamented the nine turnovers he had and blamed himself for the loss.

"Nine turnovers is obviously never going to get it done," Lin told reporters. "It is on me in terms of taking care of the ball. If everyone credits me for the last seven games then I deserve this one on my shoulders."

Despite the close lose to the Hornets, 89-85, the improbable story that the New York media dubbed "Linsanity" and the exploits of the Harvard-educated point guard continues.

Lin grabbed international attention this month when he was called off the bench and immediately became the Knicks' go-to-guy. The then unknown Asian-American point guard scored 25 points to help his team beat the New Jersey Nets that first game.

Lin turned more heads February 10 after getting the better of Kobe Bryant -- arguably the NBA's top player -- scoring 38 points in the Knicks' win over the Los Angeles Lakers.

Linsanity reached a fever pitch earlier this week when the one-time bench warmer hit a game-winning shot against the Toronto Raptors.

Lin will get a chance to start a new winning streak Sunday when the Knicks take on the NBA champions Dallas Mavericks.
