(PEOPLE.com) -- And baby makes 22!

Polygamist reality television star Kody Brown and his fourth wife, Robyn, welcomed their first child together -- a son named Solomon -- at 2:02 a.m. Wednesday morning at the couple's home in Las Vegas, they tell PEOPLE exclusively.

The baby boy weighed in at 9 lbs., 10.5 oz., and is 22 inches long.

"He's perfect and we couldn't be happier," Kody tells PEOPLE. "We are so thrilled."

Brown, 43, and Robyn, 33, married during last year's season finale of the TLC reality show "Sister Wives" and now work to blend a family that includes three other wives and 16 additional children, some from previous marriages.

The family -- including Brown's first and only legal wife Meri, 40, their daughter, Meriah, 16; wife Janelle, 42, and their children Logan, 17, Madison, 15, Hunter, 14, Garrison, 13, Gabriel, 10, and Savanah, 6; and wife Christine, 39, and their children Aspyn, 16, Mykelti, 15, Paedon, 13, Gwendyln, 10, Ysabel, 8, and Truely, 1 -- added Robyn and her three children from a previous marriage, Dayton, 11, Aurora, 9, and Breanna, 7, to the expansive Brown clan, and moved from Utah to Nevada after police launched an investigation into the family last year. (The Browns have since filed a federal lawsuit in July challenging the constitutionality of Utah's bigamy law.)

This season, the Browns are residing in four separate homes in Las Vegas and dealing with the emotional, financial and physical strain that comes from living a "plural" lifestyle. Sister Wives airs Sunday nights (9 p.m. ET) on TLC. Solomon's birth will air on the show's season finale on November 27.
