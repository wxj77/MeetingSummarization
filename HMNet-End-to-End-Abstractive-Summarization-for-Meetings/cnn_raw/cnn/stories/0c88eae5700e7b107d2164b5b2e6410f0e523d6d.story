(CNN) -- A tropical depression that is likely to become a tropical storm by Sunday has areas of the islands of the Bahamas on guard.

The Bahamian government issued a tropical storm warning Saturday evening for portions of the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos.

CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Gray said Saturday the storm is a bit "ragged" but over the next day or so is likely to organize and strengthen.

According to the U.S. National Hurricane Center forecast track, the storm is likely to stay just east of the United States' Atlantic coast.

However, Gray said any sort of deviation from the forecast path later this week could result in high surf and rip currents in areas along the U.S. coast.
