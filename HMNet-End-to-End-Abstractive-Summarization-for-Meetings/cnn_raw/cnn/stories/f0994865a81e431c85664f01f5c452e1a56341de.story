Hewitt will play Kate Callahan, a "seasoned undercover agent whose stellar work at the FBI has landed her a coveted position with the Behavioral Analysis Unit."

"We're thrilled to introduce a new special agent by adding the very talented Jennifer Love Hewitt to our amazing cast," said showrunner Erica Messer. "Many of us on the show have enjoyed working with her over the years and look forward to again. We have exciting storylines planned for her character and the entire BAU team as we head into our 10th season."
