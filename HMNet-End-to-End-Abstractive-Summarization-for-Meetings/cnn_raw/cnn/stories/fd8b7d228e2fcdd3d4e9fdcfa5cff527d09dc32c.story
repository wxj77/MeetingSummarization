(CNN)Don't listen to the haters, Dakota Johnson: You made your famous mother proud.

The "Fifty Shades" actor received mixed reviews for her appearance this weekend on "Saturday Night Live." Despite a few crowd-pleasing moments, a controversial sketch starring Johnson as an ISIS recruit dominated conversation of the episode.

Amid the furor, Johnson's mother, Melanie Griffith, chimed in Sunday with a totally unbiased view.

"She killed it!!! Wow! I loved her poise, her comic timing, her grace, loved everything she did!!" Griffith said on Twitter.
