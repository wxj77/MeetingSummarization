(CNN) -- Iran and six world powers ended talks on Tehran's nuclear program with plans to meet again next month, the EU said Friday.

The four-day meeting that came to a close Thursday in Vienna brought together technical experts, said Michael Mann, a spokesman for European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.

"There will now be consultations in capitals, in the expectation that technical talks will continue soon," Mann said.

The talks come after an interim deal last month aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for lifting crippling economic sanctions.

That six-month deal, reached between Iran and the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany, eases some $7 billion in economic sanctions in return for limiting aspects of Iran's nuclear program.

Iranian state news agency IRNA said the next round of talks will be in Tehran on January 21.
