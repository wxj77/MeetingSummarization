(CNN) -- If you're a big Alec Baldwin fan, you might consider cashing in your 401(k) to bid on an evening with the actor.

Baldwin is on the auction block from now until April 24 in a fundraiser for the Screen Actors Guild Foundation, a charity that helps actors.

The top bidder gets four prime seats to Baldwin's Broadway show "Orphans" and dinner with the star after the performance. Baldwin picks up the dinner tab! Travel expenses and accommodations in New York are not included.

"I proudly support the mission of the Screen Actors Guild Foundation and I'm grateful to be able to give back to my fellow performers," said Baldwin, a SAG Foundation ambassador. "I'm also looking forward to having a great evening and lively dinner conversation with my four guests."

Bidding through CharityBuzz.com, which ends April 24, on Monday evening was at $4,500 for the package valued at $25,000.

The SAG Foundation "provides vital assistance and educational programming to the professionals of SAG-AFTRA while serving the public at large through its signature children's literacy programs," its website said.
