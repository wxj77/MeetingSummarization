(CNN)Your guide to the best new children's and young adult literature is here.

The winners of the 2015 Newbery, Caldecott, Printz, Coretta Scott King and other prestigious youth media awards were announced Monday morning by the American Library Association. In addition to books, these awards highlight videos and other creative materials produced for children over the past year.

Diverse authors and titles from 2014, such as "The Crossover" by Kwame Alexander and "Brown Girl Dreaming" by Jacqueline Woodson, were highlighted with many awards, causing the audience to cheer the choices by the committees.

The Caldecott Medal went to "The Adventures of Beekle: The Unimaginary Friend," illustrated and written by Dan Santat, which follows the journey of an imaginary friend in search of his perfect match.

The Newbery Medal was awarded to "The Crossover" by Kwame Alexander, a story about family and brotherhood told through verse by 12-year-old twin basketball players Josh and Jordan Bell.

Parents can use these titles as a guide when considering what books to recommend to their children and teens, while teachers and librarians look to the award-winning and runner-up titles as a helpful list of what to keep on the shelves in classrooms and libraries.

The ALA Youth Media Awards were announced during the organization's winter meeting in Chicago and selected by a national judging committee of librarians and children's literature experts.
