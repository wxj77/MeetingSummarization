(CNN) -- People are looking at Nick Jonas' hand, but not for that famed purity ring.

The musician and actor, who shot to fame with his siblings as part of the Jonas Brothers, has posed for some racy photos that have set the Internet on fire. Jonas is featured in a Flaunt magazine spread grabbing his crotch while wearing a pair of Calvin Klein underwear.

"No pants needed. @nickjonas in @CalvinKlein. shot by @yutsai. #mycalvins #thegrindissue," the magazine tweeted along with photos of the singer, his pants down and baseball cap turned backward.

Jonas is currently promoting his new album. As for the purity ring that he famously wore to show he was saving himself for marriage, Jonas has said the jewelry is gone while the faith remains.

"I've had an incredibly intense journey with faith and religion and my own growth," he said during a HuffPost Live interview. "My belief in God is still very strong and important to me as a person and I think that's all that should matter," he continued. "I grew up in a church environment and still have love for the church."
