(CNN)  -- Chennai Super Kings won the third staging of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as they beat Mumbai Indians by 22 runs in the final of the Twenty20 tournament on Sunday.

Mumbai with home advantage and with an in-form Sachin Tendulkar in their ranks fell well short in their pursuit of the 168 for five wickets posted by Chennai in their allocated overs.

Suresh Raina was the star for Chenna with an unbeaten 57 in their knock and a tight spell of bowling including the wicket of lower-order dangerman Harbhajan Singh.

He posted a blistering 72-run stand with Chennai and Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (27) but their total still looked only respectable with the likes of Tendulkar and Keith Pollard in the Mumbai ranks.

But off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin immediately piled on the pressure with an opening maiden over to Shikhar Dhawan, who fell in the next over to Australia paceman Doug Bollinger as he edged to Dhoni.

Tendulkar and Abhishek Nayar (27) shared a 66-run stand but just when they were upping the ante, Nayar was run out and Raina, introduced for the first time in the 12th over, also got rid of Harbhajan in the same over.

The killer blow came in the 15th over when left-arm spinner Shadab Jakati had  Tendulkar caught for 48 on the boundary and then removed Saurabh Tiwary.

With the Indians needing 55 from the last three overs, the crowd were silent until Pollard, who had been mysteriously kept back, smashed Bollinger for two sixes and two fours in the 18th which yielded 22 runs.

However, both Rayudu (21) and Pollard fell in the penultimate over from Albie  Morkel and the game was up for Mumbai with the final action played out in near silence among the capacity crowd.
