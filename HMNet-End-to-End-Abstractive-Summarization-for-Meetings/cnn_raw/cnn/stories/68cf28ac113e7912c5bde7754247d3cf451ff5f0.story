(Rolling Stone) -- Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins will portray Iggy Pop in the forthcoming film "CBGB," the Hollywood Reporter confirms.

This will be Hawkins' first significant acting role, though he has had comedic roles in a handful of Foo Fighters videos. It's unclear how substantial the role will be -- there's a good chance that it's a small part and Hawkins was cast in part because he somewhat resembles the Stooges rocker in his prime.

Other parts in the film have been cast as well, including "The Borgias" actress Mickey Sumner as Patti Smith, "The Big Bang Theory" star Johnny Galecki as Television manager Terry Ork, Malin Akerman as Blondie singer Debbie Harry and Rupert Grint as Dead Boys guitarist Cheetah Chrome. Alan Rickman will star as Hilly Kristal, the owner of the famous punk rock hot spot.
