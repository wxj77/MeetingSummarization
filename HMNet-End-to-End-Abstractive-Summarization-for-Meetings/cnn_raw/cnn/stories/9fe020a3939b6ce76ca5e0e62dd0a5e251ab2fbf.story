(EW.com ) -- It's official: Emma Stone will make her Broadway debut in the current Roundabout Theatre Company revival of "Cabaret."

The 25-year-old will replace Oscar nominee Michelle Williams, who made her debut in the role of showgirl Sally Bowles when the revival opened at Studio 54 in April. Stone will take over as Sally beginning Nov. 11 (Williams exits Nov. 9) and will play the role until Feb. 1, 2015.

Alan Cummingâ€”who won a Tony Award for his portrayal of the show's Emcee in the 1998 Broadway production, which serves as the basis of this revivalâ€”will extend his run through March 29, 2015, thus confirming that yet another actress may get to tread the Cabaret boards before the show's run is through.

EW: Emma Stone in talks to replace Michelle Williams in Broadway's 'Cabaret'

Stone was linked to the show in 2013 during Roundabout's initial announcement, but film scheduling conflicts forced her to back out. Last week, word broke that she had entered negotiations to join the show when Williams vacates the iconic role.

Unrelated but completely related, Stone's beau Andrew Garfield made his Broadway debut in 2012's "Death of a Salesman." Again, unrelated... but completely related.
