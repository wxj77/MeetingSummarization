"Harry Potter" actor David Legeno has died, a California sheriff's office said.

The 50-year-old British actor, who played werewolf villain Fenrir Greyback in "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince," and both parts one and two of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows" died while hiking near Death Valley, California, said the Inyo County Sheriff's Office.

Legeno's body was discovered by two hikers on Sunday in a remote desert location west of Zabriskie Point and had to be removed by a helicopter, according to a press release from the Inyo County Sheriff's Department.

"The remains have been identified as David Legeno, a 50-year-old United Kingdom man. It appears that Legeno died of heat related issues, but the Inyo County Coroner will determine the final cause of death. There are no signs of foul play."

Legeno's other major film credits include "Snow White and the Huntsman," and 2005's "Batman Begins."  According to the actor's IMDB page, he had just finished production for "The Last Knights" starring Morgan Freeman and Clive Owen.

According to The Hollywood Reporter Legeno was also an MMA fighter and boxer and lived in southern England with his daughter.
