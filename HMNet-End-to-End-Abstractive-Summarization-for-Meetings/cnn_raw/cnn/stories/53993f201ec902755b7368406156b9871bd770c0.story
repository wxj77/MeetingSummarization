(CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is doing well as she recovers from surgery, officials said Tuesday.

"The operation has been satisfactory; it has turned out very well. The president is in her room and is in very good spirits," presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said in a statement.

Doctors said there were no complications in the surgery to remove a blood clot from the surface of Fernandez's brain. Fernandez, 60, remained hospitalized in Buenos Aires and was "progressing well," doctors said.

Over the weekend, doctors diagnosed Fernandez with a subdural hematoma and said she needed to take a month off of work.

A subdural hematoma is a blood clot on the brain's surface beneath its outer covering, called the dura. Often, in people over 60, a brain trauma can cause the blood vessels in the brain to tear and blood to clot.

According to Argentina's constitution, the vice president assumes the presidency temporarily in the president's absence.

In a televised speech Monday, Vice President Amado Boudou said the situation was similar to the time when Fernandez temporarily handed presidential powers over to him when she underwent surgery in January 2012 to remove her thyroid.

"This phase of 30 days is exactly the same," he said. "There is no question or uncertainty, no strange question. She is taking her rest, a rest that she needs, and also that she deserves. ... And the key is to keep governing. And that is what she has asked of us. And that is what you will find the whole team of the president doing, governing."
