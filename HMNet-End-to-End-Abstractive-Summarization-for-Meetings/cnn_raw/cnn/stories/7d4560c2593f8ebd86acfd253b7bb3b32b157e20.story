(CNN) -- Over the past four months "Road to Durban: A Green City Journey" has traveled south from the UK to the COP17 Conference in Durban, exploring efforts to reduce carbon emissions in urban centers.

In the UK, Germany, Turkey and South Africa, three CNN reporters went in search of the best examples of how carbon cuts are being made in cities - with a particular focus on industry, transport, waste, architecture and the economics of renewable energy.

But what are our governments doing in the battle against global warming? CNN's Robyn Curnow hosts a high profile panel debate with four leading thinkers in the environmental lobby.

The questions are this: Why has it been so hard for countries to agree on the right way forward? What is the responsibility of the developed and developing nations? And finally, how economically viable will it be to create the sustainable cities of the future.

The Panel:

-Professor Pan Jiahua, advisor to the Chinese Delegation

-Elliot Diringer, former Advisor to the Clinton Administration and part of the US Delegation at the signing of Kyoto Protocol

-Kumi Naidoo, native South African and Executive Director of Greenpeace International

-Mary Robinson - former President of Ireland, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and President of Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice
