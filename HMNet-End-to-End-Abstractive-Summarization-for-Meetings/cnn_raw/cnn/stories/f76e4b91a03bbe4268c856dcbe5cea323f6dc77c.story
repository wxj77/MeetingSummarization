(BudgetTravel.com) -- We know, you and your credit card have been through a lot together.

You used it to buy your new laptop and your vacation to France, to pay the electricity bill and support your weekly Whole Foods habit.

There have been good times, like the time your card covered your car rental insurance, or the time you got a $50 gift card in the mail from the company's rewards program.

But ask yourself, what has your credit card really done for you lately? Hiked its Annual Percentage Rate, added mysterious fees, punished you for 'foreign transactions' on your trip to Mexico?

Accept it: this relationship isn't going to work out. It's time to put your spending power into a credit card program that values your thirst for traveling.
