(PEOPLE.com) -- As if you couldn't tell by that massive rock taking up residence on her ring finger, Kim Kardashian is a big fan of bling. And the reality-star-turned-fashion-designer continues to channel her sparkly aesthetic as her Belle Noel jewelry collection -- created in collaboration with designer Pascal Mouawad -- enters into its third season.

"I love to accessorize. I think more is more when it comes to fun accessories," the newlywed (in Milly) tells WWD of her taste in jewelry, which she describes as "both glitz and glam, polished and put together."

But just because Kardashian likes her ice doesn't mean she never goes without it. "I don't wear it to work out," she admits. "I see women coming to the gym with earrings on. I can't do it." Same goes for bedtime, she says. "For some reason I need it all off, though people do ... sleep with their earrings on."

While she's enjoyed collaborating with her sisters on items like their book, "Kardashian Konfidential," and their "Kardashian Kollection" clothing line for Sears, the star admits she does love having a jewelry line to call her own.

"It's something I do independently from my sisters. That's kind of rewarding when they see pieces and really like it and want it," she shares. "It's all mine."
