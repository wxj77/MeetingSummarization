(InStyle.com) -- At the 2012 Academy Awards each celebrity came out looking her personal best.

"Gwyneth Paltrow was elegant, Meryl Streep's look said 'I'm a movie star,' and Viola Davis was powerful and majestic," says InStyle Fashion Director Hal Rubenstein. Each woman dressed the way we want to see them and their confidence really shined through. The night wasn't dominated by a singular designer, silhouette or trend, but amazing earrings were the finishing touch on the diverse looks, says Rubenstein.

Check out the night's greatest gowns.

Meryl Streep

For her 17th Oscars as a nominee, Meryl Streep went for the gold in Lanvin's first ever custom-made eco gown, made from eco-certified fabric sourced with help from Livia Firth's Green Carpet Challenge.

Viola Davis

Vera Wang designed the Best Actress nominee's strapless green gown, which featured a pleated skirt detail and embroidered neckline. "She did right by me," "The Help" star graciously said of the designer. Davis completed the look with matching emerald earrings and a sparkling diamond cuff.

Gwyneth Paltrow

The actress wowed in white! Paltrow accessorized her Tom Ford gown and dramatic floor length cape with an Anna Hu Haute Joaillerie diamond cuff and ring and a sleek low ponytail.

Michelle Williams

The Best Actress nominee chose a silk and organza Louis Vuitton dress with a peplum waist, and she had to pool her friends to clarify the hue. "I've been asking everyone what color it is, and they say it's coral or maybe pomegranate," she said. (The label officially called it "burnt orange.") The "My Week With Marilyn" star played up the strapless neckline with a Fred Leighton for Forevermark necklace that featured 30 carats worth of brilliant-cut diamonds.

Rooney Mara

"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" star and Best Leading Actress nominee went minimal in a white Givenchy gown with a plunging neckline.
