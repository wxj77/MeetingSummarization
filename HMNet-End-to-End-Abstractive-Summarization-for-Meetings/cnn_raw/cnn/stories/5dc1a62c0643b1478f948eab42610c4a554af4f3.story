(CNN) -- The Bling Ring, Sofia Coppola's acerbically arresting fifth feature, is a tasty contradiction: a clear-eyed, empathetic look at people the movie doesn't even pretend you can like. It's a true-life drama of American youth culture gone mad.

Given what a debased view that is, the clever beauty of The Bling Ring is its scandalous yet never mocking tone, its refusal to satirize. For a while, the girls' personalities seem almost interchangeable, but that's part of the texture. Katie Chang gives the leader a ripe synthetic glow, and Emma Watson does a remarkable job of demonstrating that glassy-eyed insensitivity need not be stupid. A-
