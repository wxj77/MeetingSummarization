(CNN) -- Nicki Minaj isn't feeling welcomed at her old high school -- or at least that's what she's saying on Twitter.

In a series of tweets posted on Thursday, the rapper implied that her former stomping grounds, New York's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High, turned down her request to speak to the school's students.

"I wanted to go back to my HS and speak to the students, but the new principal declined," Minaj said. "No need for me to inspire them, I guess. ... That school changed my life and I wanted to pay it forward to the students there now. I was really looking forward to it."

The "Anaconda" rapper's tweets suggest the school didn't give a reason for declining her appearance. (When asked directly whether she received an explanation, Minaj tweeted, "not really.")

LaGuardia High deferred all comment to the New York Department of Education, who explained that former graduates could return to the school unless it would interrupt the students' learning.

"Of course alumni are welcome back to our campuses and we love to celebrate their success, providing it does not interrupt the educational process," an official for the DOE said in a statement. "Alumni visit all the time and address students. However, we do not allow reality TV to be filmed on school property. For documentaries, any visit to a public school must be educational in nature and cannot intrude on instruction."

It isn't yet clear if Minaj's appearance would have included reality TV cameras. Minaj's reps have not responded to a request for comment.

Minaj wasn't the only one disappointed by the school's response. The colorful rapper retweeted replies from disgruntled fans who took issue with the star's lack of access.

"I'm still in disbelief that the principal declined her visitation to motivate," said a fan. "Does she not know how much Nicki impacts this generation?"
