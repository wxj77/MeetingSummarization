(CNN) -- Mexico has received the support of parliamentary leaders from 10 nations in opposition to Arizona's controversial new immigration law, the Mexican Senate president said Wednesday.

Mexico and the other nations signed a declaration expressing their "strong condemnation and profound rejection of the law," said Senate President Carlos Navarrete Ruiz.

The Arizona law, which is scheduled to go into effect later this month, requires anyone being investigated by police for a possible crime to provide proof of legal residency.

Opponents say the measure is discriminatory and invites racial profiling, but supporters say it's necessary to curb the flood of illegal immigrants in the border state.

The U.S. Justice Department filed suit against the law, SB 1070, this month on the ground that Arizona is usurping federal authority to control the border and enforce immigration law.

The federal suit has drawn opposition from some members of Congress. On Wednesday, 81 senators and representatives filed an amicus brief disputing the Justice Department contention that the law is unconstitutional.

Mexico has been a vocal opponent of the law since the Arizona legislature passed it in April.

Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Navarrete said Mexico received support from Uruguay, Panama, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guatemala, Cuba, Turkey, Senegal, Micronesia and Ghana.

Mexico also received backing from the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council, Navarrete said, according to the state-run Notimex news agency.

The declarations of support came at the three-day Third World Conference of Parliamentary Presidents, which ended Wednesday in Geneva, Switzerland.
