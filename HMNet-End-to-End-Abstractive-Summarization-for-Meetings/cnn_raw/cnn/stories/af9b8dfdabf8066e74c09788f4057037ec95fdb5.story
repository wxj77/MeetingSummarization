(CNN) -- Libya has withdrawn as hosts of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations tournament because of ongoing security issues in the country, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has announced.

The decision follows a meeting between Libyan sports officials and CAF president Issa Hayatou at CAF headquarters in Cairo, Egypt on Friday August 22.

A statement published on the CAF website Saturday said that "owing to the unstable security situation in the country, Libya would not be able to host the Afcon in 2017."

CAF secretary general, Hicham El Amrani has informed all 54 member associations of the decision, CAF's official website reported.

New bids to host the 2017 tournament will now be accepted with a deadline for submission of September 30 2014.

"The CAF Executive Committee will select a host country whose dossier guarantees that accommodation, transportation and hotels facilities, as well as training sites and stadiums already exist," a CAF statement said.

A decision on a new host country will be made in 2015.

Libya was scheduled to host the 2013 tournament but had to pass on hosting duties to South Africa for security reasons.
