(CNN) -- A tornado touched down in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, on Saturday afternoon, injuring at least four people and leaving the area without electricity, according to emergency officials.

The twister struck Mayaguez, on Puerto Rico's western coast, at 12:35 p.m., according to Luis Correa, a spokesman for the State Emergency Department.

Video showed twisted scaffolding and crushed cars, among other structural damage at a stadium set to host the 21st Central and Caribbean Games beginning Saturday night.

Cables were also downed, causing the area to lose power, officials said.

The start of the games, featuring hundreds of athletes in a variety of sports from more than 30 countries, has been postponed until Sunday, officials said.

Strong winds remained in the area after the tornado had passed through as workers at the stadium rushed to secure tents and lighting towers, video showed.

The four injured were taken to a local hospital where they are in stable condition, said Janita Soto, a spokeswoman for the Mayaguez police.

Two of the injured were hurt "when they were running out of fear," said Sandra Virella, an emergency department spokeswoman.
