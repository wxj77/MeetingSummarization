(CNN) -- Lemony Snicket's "A Series of Unfortunate Events" will now be told as a TV series.

According to reports, Netflix is developing a small-screen version of the popular children's book series written by Daniel Handler, who crafted them under the pen name Lemony Snicket.

Handler's stories followed a trio of siblings encountering one disaster after another, starting with the death of their parents in a fire.

The stories can be dark, but they're also engaging and humorous -- the kind of stuff that a family could enjoy together, said Netflix's Cindy Holland, vice president of original content.

"On the search for fantastic material that appeals to both parents and kids, the first stop for generations of readers is 'A Series of Unfortunate Events,' " Holland said in a statement to Deadline.

"The world created by Lemony Snicket is unique, darkly funny and relatable. We can't wait to bring it to life for Netflix members."

Snicket, speaking from an "undisclosed location," told The Hollywood Reporter that he couldn't believe the news. "After years of providing top-quality entertainment on demand, Netflix is risking its reputation and its success by associating itself with my dismaying and upsetting books," the "Unfortunate Events" narrator said.

Audiences have seen Snicket's tales brought to life before with Paramount's 2004 live-action movie starring Jim Carrey, Jude Law and Meryl Streep. Paramount Television is producing this original series with Netflix, along with author Handler as the executive producer.
