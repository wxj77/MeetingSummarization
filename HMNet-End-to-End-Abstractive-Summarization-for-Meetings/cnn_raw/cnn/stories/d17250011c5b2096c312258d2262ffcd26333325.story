(Rolling Stone) -- With 2012 halfway done, Adele's 21 and Gotye's "Somebody That I Used to Know" (featuring Kimbra) are the biggest selling album and digital song of the year in the U.S. respectively, Billboard reports.

"21" has continued its amazing run a year after its initial release, selling 3.69 million copies through the sales week that ended July 1, the mid-year point for tracker Nielsen SoundScan. It was the best selling album halfway through last year as well, with 2.5 million copies sold.

This is the first time in SoundScan's 21-year history that the same record has been the top seller in the first halves of any two years. If "21" continues to fly off the shelves at this rate, it could be the first record in the SoundScan era to top the year-end charts twice.

"21's" midway-point sales figures also mark another first in the SoundScan era -- it's the first time just one album has sold over a millioncopies in the year's first six months. The runner-up, Lionel Richie's "Tuskegee," has moved 912,000 copies.

To cap it all off, Adele's 2008 record, "19," finds itself as the tenth-highest selling record so far this year with 539,000 sold, making her the first artist to have two albums in the top 10 since Justin Bieber scored a pair halfway through 2010 with "My World 2.0" at No. 2 and "My World" at No. 9.

As for Gotye's ubiquitous "Somebody That I Used to Know," that track has a digital sales figure of 5.50 million for the year to date, according to SoundScan. Odds are looking good that the track will become the first to sell six million downloads in a year. "Somebody" also marks the first time a song has sold over 5 million in the first half of a year, though Gotye's smash wasn't alone in that feat, joined by Fun.'s "We Are Young" (featuring Janelle Monae), which has sold 5.09 million.

A quick rundown of the top selling albums this year finds breakout British boy band One Direction's "Up All Night" sitting at third with 889,000 copies sold. Whitney Houston's Whitney: The Greatest Hits sold 818,000 to place it at No. 4, while the compilation Now 41 takes the fifth spot with 714,000.

On the singles side, following Gotye and Fun. is Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe" with 4,064,000 sold. At the Number 4 spot is Kelly Clarkson's "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)" with 3,324,000 sold, while Nicki Minaj's "Starships" comes in at No. 5 with 3,158,000.
