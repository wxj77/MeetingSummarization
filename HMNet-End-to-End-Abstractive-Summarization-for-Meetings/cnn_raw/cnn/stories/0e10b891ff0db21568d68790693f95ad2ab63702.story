Leave it to Kanye. The hip-hop mega star may have had the last word of 2014.

In the waning hours of the year, he released a new song that's sure to get folks talking. Just not for the reasons we've come to expect from Kanye West.

In place of his usual bombast, "Only One" boasts a spare arrangement. In it, an AutoTuned Kanye tenderly sings from the perspective of his late mother as she looks down from the heavens and addresses him.

"Hello my only one, just like the morning sun/ You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name," the song's chorus goes.

In it, the mother says she talked to God who sent down angels for Kanye.

"You asked for one and you got two" -- a reference to his wife, Kim Kardashian, and their daughter, North.

The song ends with the refrain, "Tell Nori about me."

Nori is North's nickname.

Oh, did we mention, the single also features Paul McCartney.

"Paul played the piano," tweeted Mike Dean who produced the song.

The single is now available on iTunes.
