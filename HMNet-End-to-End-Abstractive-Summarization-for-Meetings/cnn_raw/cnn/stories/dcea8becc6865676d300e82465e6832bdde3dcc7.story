(CNN) -- India's Virender Sehwag plundered the highest score in one-day international cricket as his team routed the West Indies by 153-runs Thursday to clinch their five-match series.

Opener Sehwag has a reputation for fast scoring, but surpassed himself with a brutal knock of 219 off just 149 balls in India's highest-ever one-day total of 418 for five wickets in 50 overs.

Sehwag broke the previous best of 200 not out by his legendary compatriot Sachin Tendulkar as he took advantage of a perfect batting wicket at the Holkar Stadium in Indore.

He picked up 25 boundaries and seven sixes, surviving a dropped catch by West Indies captain Darren Sammy while on 170.

He was finally caught in the deep off Kieron Pollard after putting on 176 for the first wicket with Gautam Gambhir (67) and 140 for the second with Suresh Raina (55).

"I was cheering for Sachin when he got his double-hundred and it's great to emulate that," the 33-year-old Sehwag told AFP.

"The pitch was great and allowed you to play your shots. I think you can get a double-hundred like this when you're experienced. The last time I played 47 overs I got 175, this time I got 200."

The West Indies, who were looking to level the series at 2-2, were always behind the run chase as debutant leg-spinner Rahul Sharma picked up three wickets in his first three overs for the home side.

Only a fine 96 from wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin saved them from total humiliation as they fell 3-1 down in the series.

Sehwag is skippering India in the series in the absence of the rested Mahendra Singh Dhoni and had scored just 46 runs in the previous three matches.

The final game will be played in Chennai Sunday.
