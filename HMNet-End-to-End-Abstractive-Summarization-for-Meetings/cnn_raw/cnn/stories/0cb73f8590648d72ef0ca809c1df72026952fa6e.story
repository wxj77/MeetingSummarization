(CNN Student News) -- September 23, 2013

CNN Student News begins the week in Kenya, as we report on a terrorist attack at a shopping mall in that nation's capital. We also examine the potential impact of a powerful typhoon bearing down on China, and we hear how some prominent Chicagoans are hoping sports can help curb violence in the city. Plus, we meet a fast food worker whose act of kindness earned an outpouring of praise.
