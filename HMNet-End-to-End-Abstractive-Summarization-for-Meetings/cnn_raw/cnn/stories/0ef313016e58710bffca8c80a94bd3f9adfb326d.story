(CNN) -- In-form England striker Wayne Rooney scored the opening two goals as Manchester United crushed AC Milan 4-0 to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League.

Park Ji-sung and Darren Fletcher were also on target for the English Premier League champions as United secured a convincing 7-2 aggregate success.

All the talk beforehand was of Milan midfielder David Beckham's return to Old Trafford for the first time since United sold him to Real Madrid in 2003.

And the England star was given an emotional reception by the United fans when he came on as a second-half substitute.

However, Milan were already 3-0 behind when Beckham was introduced by Milan coach Leonardo and, despite some nice touches and a couple of dangerous crosses, was powerless to help Milan back into the match.

Rooney took his personal tally for the season to 30 with goals either side of half-time.

The opener came in the 13th minute when Rooney rose between two Milan defenders to head home a Gary Neville right-wing cross.

And the second came just 54 seconds after the break when Rooney broke clear through the middle to get a decisive touch to Nani's superb cross with the outside of his foot.

The tie was firmly killed off when Korean Park finished off a Paul Scholes pass and the scoring was completed when Darren Fletcher converted at the far post with two minutes remaining.

"It was a disappointing night because we lost the game but returning here is always special," Beckham told ITV Sport.

"It was unbelievable. I have to say thank you. It was really incredible. It was nice to be back, a disappointing night but nice to be back."
