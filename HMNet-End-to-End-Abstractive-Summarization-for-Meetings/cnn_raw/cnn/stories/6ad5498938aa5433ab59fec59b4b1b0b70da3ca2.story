(CNN) -- Since appearing on season 13 of "Dancing With the Stars," fans have seen less of Chaz Bono -- and he plans on keeping it that way.

Bono has lost 60 pounds and is still losing, he told People. The weight loss has been the result of better eating habits and exercise, he said.

"Diets don't work," he told the magazine. "You just have to change what you eat, and I have."

That includes incorporating more meat, fruits and veggies, the son of megastar Cher said, as well as cutting back on grains and starches.

In 2005, Bono participated in VH1's "Celebrity Fit Club 3" before gender reassignment surgery that transformed him from Chastity Bono to Chaz. EW reported that in November Bono appeared on "The Doctors" and co-host Dr. Travis Stork advised him on how to lose weight.

"Because I'm transgender, I was always completely disconnected from my body," Bono said during the show. "I really lived in my head and just kind of tried to ignore everything from the neck down."

While attending the GLAAD Media Awards this past weekend, Bono said he is still dancing and that part of his exercise routine now also includes martial arts training.
