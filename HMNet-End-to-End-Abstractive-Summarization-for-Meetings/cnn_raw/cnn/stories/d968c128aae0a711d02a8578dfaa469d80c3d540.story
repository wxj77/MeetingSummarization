(CNN) -- Former Italian motorcycle racer Doriano Romboni has been killed in an accident at an event marking the memory of late MotoGP rider Marco Simoncelli.

Romboni, 44, was struck by another motorcycle during a training session for the second annual "Sic Supermoto Day" at Italy's Latina circuit, 70 kilometers south east of the capital Rome.

Following the incident, Romboni was airlifted to hospital but died shortly after arrival, Italian News Agency ANSA reported.

The fatal accident has echoes of the way his compatriot Simoncelli died. The 24-year-old was killed following a collision with American rider Colin Edwards and Italy's Valentino Rossi during the Malaysian Grand Prix in October 2011.

Romboni was a six-time winner in 125cc and 250cc races and competed in the 500cc class (the forerunner to MotoGP) from 1996-1998 with his best finish coming at the 1997 Dutch TT at Assen where he finished third for the Aprilia team.
