Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- An explosion near a bank killed at least 10 people in northeastern Nigeria on Friday, witnesses and rescue volunteers said.

People were lined up at an ATM outside a bank on the outskirts of the town of Azare when the explosion happened, witnesses said.

Several other people were injured. The witnesses said the blast appeared to have come from a plastic bag near the bank.

Comments from police about what caused the explosion weren't immediately available, and there was no immediate claim of responsibility. Azare has been the site of previous attacks by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which has waged an insurgency in northeastern Nigeria for five years in a campaign to impose its strict version of Sharia, or Islamic law.
