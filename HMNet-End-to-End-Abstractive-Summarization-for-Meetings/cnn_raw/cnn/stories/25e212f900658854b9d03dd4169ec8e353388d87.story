(CNN) -- A third suspect has been arrested in the California death of a deployed Marine's wife, authorities said.

Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino, 36, was taken into custody Thursday night in connection with the death of Brittany Killgore, according to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.

Authorities did not say what charges Maraglino will face.

Investigators found Killgore's body on April 17 in a rural part of Riverside County.

Authorities have already arrested Marine Staff Sgt. Luis Ray Perez, on a suspicion of murder charge. They have also arrested Jessica Lynn Lopez and charged her with first-degree murder. Both suspects have pleaded not guilty.

Killgore's connection with the suspects has been unclear.

Brittany Killgore had recently filed for divorce from her husband, who was serving with an artillery unit in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, investigators said. Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore, her husband, was granted an emergency leave to return to the United States when he learned about his wife.

"My wife, Brittany, was beautiful beyond words and her murder has left me devastated. My duty to her memory is now to ensure her good reputation remains intact, and help law enforcement and prosecutors secure justice for the person or persons who took her away from me," Cory Killgore said in April.
