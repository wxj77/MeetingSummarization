Washington (CNN) -- While the first lady and daughters Malia and Sasha were away for part of the weekend, President Barack Obama enjoyed what some have jokingly referred to as a bachelor's weekend with friends -- golfing, playing basketball and grilling out on the South Lawn.

The festivities were all part of a belated birthday celebration of sorts for the president, who turned 49 on Wednesday.

First lady Michelle Obama and youngest daughter Sasha, 9, returned from a vacation in Spain on Sunday in time to join the president for a seafood barbecue on the South Lawn. The Obamas' 12-year-old daughter, Malia, has been attending camp.

Tables set up with white and yellow linens and adorned with centerpieces of lemons and limes dotted the lawn.

The menu included shrimp from the Gulf Coast, where the seafood industry has been hard-hit by the BP oil disaster, according to White House aide Katie Hogan.

Friends from Hawaii, Chicago, Illinois, and college joined the president on Saturday at Andrews Air Force Base for a round of golf.

The sports outings continued Sunday with a basketball game at Fort McNair where Obama -- along with such NBA stars as LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Grant Hill and Earvin "Magic" Johnson -- played in front of an audience of wounded servicemen and participants in the White House mentoring program.
