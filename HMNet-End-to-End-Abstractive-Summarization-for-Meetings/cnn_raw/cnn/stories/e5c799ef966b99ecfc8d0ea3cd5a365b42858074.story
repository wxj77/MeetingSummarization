(CNN)An anonymous letter bitterly insulting African-American officers was recently found in mailboxes at a Connecticut police station.

It was written on official letterhead, CNN affiliate WFSB reported.

It starts out with the words "WHITE POWER" in capital letters.  And it contains a line that reads, "These Black Officers belong in the toilet." It ends at the bottom with a repeat of the words "WHITE POWER."

The letter was flagged to authorities by a police organization for minority officers, The Bridgeport Guardians.

Though decidedly racist against all black officers, the letter singles out one in particular -- Clive Higgins, who a jury recently acquitted of using undue force in the kicking of a detained man lying at the feet of Higgins. Two other officers, one Hispanic and one white, were also involved.

Those men -- Elson Morales and Joseph Lawlor -- resigned from the force, pleaded guilty to the kicking charges and will serve three months in prison, local news site ctpost.com reported.

The incident in May 2011 was caught on video and posted to YouTube.

The unsteady shot begins with the nattering sound of a Taser, before the lens sways over to a man on the ground.

Two police officers appear to try to cuff him, then both of them kick him. A third officer, African-American, pulls up in a squad car and launches one small kick at the detained man lying on the ground.

Whoever wrote the racist letter apparently didn't like that Higgins was acquitted alone and threatened his life for not going along with his convicted colleagues.

"You better watch your back. We know where you live. Your face was all over the newspaper. Remember you have no duty weapon to defend yourself," it read.

Local news site ctpost.com posted a copy of the letter online.

CNN's Rick Martin and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.
