(CNN) -- A magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck southwest Colombia Sunday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, CNN affiliate Caracol Television reported.

The quake was centered 10 km (6 miles) west-northwest of Isnos, Colombia, and 334 km (214 mi) northeast of Quito, Ecuador, the USGS said on its website. It was felt in Bogota -- the nation's capital and largest city -- Caracol reported.

It occurred at a depth of 162.1 km (100.7 miles), the USGS said.

"Deep earthquakes in this region ... are not uncommon; there have been 13 similar events deeper than 100 km over the past 40 years, within 500 km" of Sunday's earthquake, the USGS said.
