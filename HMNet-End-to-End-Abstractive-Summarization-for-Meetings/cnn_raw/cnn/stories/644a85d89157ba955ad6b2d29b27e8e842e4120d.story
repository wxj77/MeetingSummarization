(Rolling Stone) -- In an email to fans, comedian Louis C.K. has announced he will sell tickets to his upcoming tour exclusively on his official website.

All tickets will be $45, with C.K. reserving the right to cancel a ticket in exchange for a refund if the ticketholder attempts to sell the ticket for "anything above the original price."

"Making my shows affordable has always been my goal but two things have always worked against that. High ticket charges and ticket re-sellers marking up the prices," explained C.K. in the email. "Some ticketing services charge more than 40% over the ticket price and, ironically, the lower I've made my ticket prices, the more scalpers have bought them up, so the more fans have paid for a lot of my tickets.

"By selling the tickets exclusively on my site, I've cut the ticket charges way down and absorbed them into the ticket price," he continues. "To buy a ticket, you join NOTHING. Just use your credit card and buy the damn thing."

Louis C.K. starts his tour on October 3rd in Cleveland and wraps up on February 1st, 2013 in Washington D.C.
