(CNN) -- The world's population is about to reach 7 billion on Monday, according to the United Nations.

More than a third of the globe's people are in two countries.

China and India account for more than 1 billion people each. Both have at least three times as many people as the United States, which has the world's third-largest population at a little more than 300 million.
