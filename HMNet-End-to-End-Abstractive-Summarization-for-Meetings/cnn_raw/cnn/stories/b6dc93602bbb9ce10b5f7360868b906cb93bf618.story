Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Thirteen people were killed and 90 wounded in clashes between Coptic Christians and Muslims in Cairo, state-run Egyptian television reported Wednesday.

The clashes broke out Tuesday after Copts took to the streets to protest last week's burning of a church.

Earlier, Egypt's health minister, Dr. Ashraf Hatem, said the death toll was at nine. Coptic Church spokesman Father Abdelmaseeh Baseet reported six deaths previously Wednesday and said all the victims were Christians.

The Egyptian military has launched an investigation into the violence, said Mohamed Askar, armed services spokesman.

Those involved in "the incitement of sectarian hatred or involved in the acts of violence" will be held accountable "to the full extent of the law," he said.

A feud between a Muslim and a Coptic family is said to have led to the church burning in Helwan province last week.

In recent weeks, tensions have been high between Egypt's Muslim majority and its Coptic minority.

A Coptic church in the town of Alexandria was bombed on New Year's Day, killing 23 people. The Palestinian Islamic Army, which has links to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for what was the deadliest attack on Christians in Egypt in some time -- but far from the only one.

Ten days later, a gunman killed a Christian man and wounded five other Christians on a train in Egypt.

Also in January, a man was sentenced for his part in an attack on another Coptic church a year ago, Egypt's state-run Al Ahram newspaper reported.

About 9% of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity.

The religion split with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ.
