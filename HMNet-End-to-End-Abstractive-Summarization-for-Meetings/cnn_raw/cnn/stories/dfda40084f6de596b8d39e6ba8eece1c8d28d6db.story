Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed to a Los Angeles, California, hospital Friday because of "complications" relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, her publicist said.

Her husband called an ambulance to their Bel Air home to take the actress to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on Friday afternoon, spokesman John Blanchette said.

Gabor, 93, had returned home on Wednesday, three weeks after undergoing surgery to replace a hip broken in a fall from her bed.

Gabor has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, said her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt.  The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.

The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders.

Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, "Moulin Rouge," "The Story of Three Loves" in 1953, "The Girl in the Kremlin" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, "Touch of Evil."
