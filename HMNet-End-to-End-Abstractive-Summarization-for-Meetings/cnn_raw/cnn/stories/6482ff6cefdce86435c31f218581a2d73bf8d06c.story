(CNN) -- R&B power couple Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz have tied the knot, Keys' representatives confirmed to CNN on Sunday.

The two were married Saturday at a private residence overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.

Keys, 29, a 12-time Grammy-award winning singer, wore a Grecian-inspired, one-shoulder Vera Wang gown. Her groom, a DJ/producer/rapper, wore a tuxedo designed by Tom Ford that featured a white jacket and pale pink shirt.

The couple are expecting a child together.

Swizz Beatz and Keys have been friends for several years and worked together on one song for her current album, "The Element of Freedom."
