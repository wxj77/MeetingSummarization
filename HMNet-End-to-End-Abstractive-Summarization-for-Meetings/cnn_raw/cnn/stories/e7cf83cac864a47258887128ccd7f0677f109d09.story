(CNN) -- An explosion in the Maldives' capital of Male Saturday injured at least 12 people, Maldives officials and the British Foreign Office confirmed to CNN.

Two of those injured in the 1:30 p.m. blast (4:30 a.m. ET) were British tourists, the Foreign Office said.

Maldives Minister of Tourism, Dr. Mahamood Shougee, told CNN the British tourists suffered significant burns in the explosion.

Two Japanese tourists and eight Chinese people were also injured, but less seriously, Shougee said.

He told CNN the explosive was a small, homemade device. It detonated in a park area that houses the country's national museum, he added.

Police are investigating the blast, but Shougee said "it is too early to comment or speculate who might have done it."
