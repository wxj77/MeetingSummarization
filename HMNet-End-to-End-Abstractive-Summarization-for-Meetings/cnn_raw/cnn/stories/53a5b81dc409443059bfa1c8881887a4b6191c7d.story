(CNN) -- Let the extravagant wedding planning begin.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are now engaged, according to E! News, the network that airs Kardashian's reality show. West popped the question Monday, Kardashian's 33rd birthday.

Kardashian's old engagement ring reportedly fetches $749,000

The reality star and new mom confirmed the news on her Instagram account Tuesday, offering fans a close-up view of her sparkler in a photo captioned, "YES!!!"

Naturally, the "Yeezus" rapper couldn't propose just anywhere -- he rented out the stadium where the San Francisco Giants play.

The couple's friends and family were on hand for the event, which was topped off by fireworks and a 50-piece orchestra, E! said. Kardashian got a 15-carat Lorraine Schwartz ring.

Kardashian matriarch and self-proclaimed "momager" Kris Jenner gushed about the engagement.

"A match made in heaven!" she told the network. "I am so happy for both of my kids, Kim and Kanye."

The couple are the parents of 4-month-old North West, who was born just days after Kardashian's divorce from NBA player Kris Humphries was finalized. That marriage lasted 72 days.
