(Mashable)  -- Facebook profiles are like belly buttons: Everybody's got one.

Perhaps that statement's still a bit of an exaggeration, but by the numbers, we (that is, Internet users around the globe) are becoming more obsessed with Facebook by the day.

One out of every 13 Earthlings and three out of four Americans is on Facebook, and one out of 26 signs into Facebook on a daily basis.

We could rattle off stats like until the cows come home, but instead, we'd like to show you this fascinating infographic from SocialHype and OnlineSchools.org.

Here, in a visual nutshell, are some highlights about Facebook usage, 2010 trends, adoption numbers and a great deal more.

Take a good look at this information (or click here for the full-size version), and in the comments, let us know what you think about our global fascination with Facebook.

Is Facebook an amazing connective medium? A plague that preys on the easily addicted? A little bit of both, or something else entirely?
