(CNN) -- An extradition hearing will be held Friday for the boyfriend of a Michigan woman whose body was pulled from a swamp in Indiana, authorities said.

Divers found the body of Dawn Marie Fital, 45, stuffed in a suitcase Thursday.

Her legs, arms and head were bound with duct tape, said Rob Arnold, a spokesman for the Lake County police.

The 45-year-old had been missing since Monday.

Her boyfriend, Greg Noack, 44, was taken into police custody in Merrillville, Indiana, near where her body was discovered.

Michigan prosecutors have charged the suspect, who is being held in Indiana, with murder.

He will appear for an extradition hearing at the Lake County magistrate court jail Friday morning.

Police believe he killed Fital in Michigan, then drove across state lines, where he dumped her body in Indiana.

There is no word on when Fital's body will be returned to Michigan.

An autopsy has been scheduled for Saturday.
