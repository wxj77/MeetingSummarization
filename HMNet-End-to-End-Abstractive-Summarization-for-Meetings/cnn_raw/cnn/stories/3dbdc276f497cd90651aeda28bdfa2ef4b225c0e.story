(CNN) -- Anti-terror police in Denmark say they have arrested two brothers, one of whom trained at a terror camp in Somalia.

The pair is suspected of "planning a terrorist act by, among other activities, having discussed the method, the target and the weapon types to be used," the Danish Security and Intelligence Service, known as PET, said late Monday.

"PET believes that a specific act of terrorism has been averted," the agency said.

The Somali-Danish men are due to appear in court on Tuesday.

One was arrested as he flew into Copenhagen airport and the other was seized at his residence in the city of Aarhus, the security force said.

The brothers, 18 and 23, are Danish citizens of Somali origin who have lived in the Aarhus region for 16 years, PET said, without naming them.
