(CNN) -- For the past six years, CNN has been honoring everyday people who are changing the world.

The tradition continues Sunday night, when the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012 will be recognized at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.

"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute" will air live at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT on CNN's global networks. The show, hosted by Anderson Cooper, celebrates the year's top 10 CNN Heroes, who each receive a $50,000 grant for their extraordinary efforts to improve the lives of others.

At the end of the show, Cooper will announce the CNN Hero of the Year. That person, one of the top 10 Heroes, has been selected by a public vote that ended Wednesday on CNN.com. He or she will receive an additional $250,000 to continue their work.

Many celebrities will be joining CNN to help tell these Heroes' remarkable stories at Sunday's show. This year's celebrity presenters include movie stars Susan Sarandon, Adrien Brody, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Harvey Keitel and Josh Duhamel; athletes Jeff Gordon and Cullen Jones; and hip-hop artist 50 Cent. Television stars Rainn Wilson ("The Office"), Rico Rodriguez ("Modern Family"), Jane Lynch ("Glee"), Miranda Cosgrove ("iCarly") and David Spade ("Rules of Engagement") will also be in attendance.

And during the show, three-time Grammy Award winner Ne-Yo will be performing, as will "American Idol" winner Phillip Phillips.

"As we enter the season of giving thanks, we are grateful to these talented and caring entertainers who are joining us in this celebration of the human spirit," said Kelly Flynn, senior executive producer for the CNN Heroes initiative and "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute." "We appreciate the time they're taking to raise awareness for the life-changing work of this year's CNN Heroes."

One hour before the tribute show, CNN will air a special presentation, "CNN Heroes: Sharing the Spotlight," that features exclusive interviews with Ne-Yo, actor Ben Stiller and model Christy Turlington Burns.

Since January, CNN Heroes have been profiled every week on CNN and CNN.com. These Heroes were chosen from thousands of nominations submitted through the CNN Heroes website.

Here are the top 10 Heroes of 2012, in alphabetical order:
