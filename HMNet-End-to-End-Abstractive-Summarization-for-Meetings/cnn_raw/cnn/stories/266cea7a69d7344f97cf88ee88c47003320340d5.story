(CNN) -- Australian spin legend Shane Warne has retired from all forms of cricket after playing his final match for Indian Premier League side (IPL) Rajasthan Royals.

The 41-year-old, one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, ended his career on a high note, captaining the Rajasthan Royals to a 10-wicket win over the Mumbai Indians, taking one wicket for 30 runs in the process.

"It's been a privilege and a pleasure to captain the Royals," Warne said after the match. "Hopefully, I've helped Indian cricket."

Warne fined $50K ahead of retirement

The colorful Warne has been popular with his teammates and supporters alike during this IPL campaign despite struggling for form and being involved in some off-field controversies.

Even this week, Warne was fined $50,000 following a row with Rajasthan Cricket Association secretary Sanjay Dixit over a choice of wicket.

Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar paid tribute to Warne, telling reporters: "He is a true champion, a wonderful friend. I have not been privileged to play with him in the same team, but it's been a real treat to play against him."

Warne retired from international cricket in 2007 after becoming the first player in history to take 700 wickets.

The leg-spinner always proved as controversial off the field as he was brilliant on it, surviving drug and betting scandals, as well as a much-publicized private life, during his career.

His retirement is expected to include more TV commentating, charity work and coaching.

"I'm going to be 42 this year, I'm in a great place in life, both personally and from the business point of view, I just want to thank everyone who supported me,"  Warne told reporters.
