Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former "American Idol" contestant Pia Toscano has signed a record deal with Interscope Records and will release her debut single next week, the label said Wednesday.

Within hours after she was voted off the 10th season of the talent show in April, reports surfaced that Toscano had been signed by Interscope head -- and "Idol" mentor Jimmy Iovine.

But at the time, Toscano told CNN it was not a done deal.

On Wednesday, the label said Toscano's debut single, "This Time," will arrive July 12. The album comes out later in the year.

"Jimmy Iovine was an amazing mentor during my time on Idol and I'm looking forward to working with him and everyone at Interscope Records and 19 Recordings," Toscano said. "This is a dream come true."

The single was penned by Esther Dean, who has written songs for Katy Perry, Mary J. Blige and Rihanna, the label said.
