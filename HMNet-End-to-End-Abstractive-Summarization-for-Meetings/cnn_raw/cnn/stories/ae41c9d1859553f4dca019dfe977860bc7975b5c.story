(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson's quarter of a century in charge of Manchester United has been rich and varied and, of course, accompanied by a glittering list of trophies.

From the joyous highs of European Champions League triumphs in Barcelona and Moscow, to the lows of bust-ups with David Beckham and watching Jose Mourinho pip him to two titles, every moment has been played out in the full glare of the media spotlight.

With countless memorable quotes and games under his belt, Ferguson will celebrate his 25 years in charge of the Premier League champions on Sunday, a day after his side face Sunderland in their quest for a record 20th league title.

Here, CNN World Sport chronicles the key moments of his momentous reign at Old Trafford as he survived an indifferent start to his United career to become one of the most successful managers the English game has ever seen.
