Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong's leader made it clear on Thursday the pro-democracy protests which have clogged main thoroughfares in the city for almost three weeks cannot continue.

C.Y. Leung told a live press conference on local television that the government was eager to resume talks with the main student group -- the Hong Kong Federation of Students -- as early as next week.

However, he said city's tolerance of mass sit-ins was limited, and that some members of the public were "very discontent."

"We do not want to see anyone, including students, continuing to occupy the roads for a long time and creating conflict with the public who are disgruntled. We don't want to see clashes," he said.
