(CNN) -- Authorities are searching for a British sailor who disappeared after arriving in Dubai.

Timothy Andrew MacColl, 27, was last seen getting into a taxi about 2 a.m. on Sunday, May 27, his family said.

"It is known that he had just left the Rock Bottom Bar which is at the Regent Hotel in the area of Deira," the family said in a statement.

The bar is about a 15-minute drive from Port Rashid, where MacColl's ship, the HMS Westminster, had docked the previous day, the family said.

A shipmate saw him get into the taxi alone, the statement said.

MacColl is married and has two children, ages 6 and 4. His wife, Rachel, is expecting their third child in October.

"We are desperately worried. Checks have been made with hospitals, prisons, police stations, medical stations and mortuaries and there is no record of him and no sightings so far," Rachel MacColl said in the statement.

"I last spoke with Timmy at midday on Saturday and he was in really good spirits and looking forward to speaking with the children on Skype on Sunday. That call never happened. It is completely out of character for him not to contact us, and we are completely at a loss and going crazy with worry.

"Wherever Timmy is, I know that he wants to be found. ... He may be in trouble somewhere, he could be trapped as far as we know, we have absolutely no idea. Please, please help us find him."

A spokesman for Britain's Royal Navy confirmed that MacColl is "unaccounted for in Dubai" and said "everything is being done to ensure that he is located safely."

British authorities are working with local authorities. "We take great care to look after all members of the Naval Service wherever they serve around the world," the navy spokesman said.

CNN's Kindah Shair and Josh Levs contributed to this report.
