La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck Bolivia Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

The quake's epicenter was about 185 kilometers (115 miles) south-southeast of Santa Ana, Bolivia, the agency said. It struck at a depth of about 530 kilometers (330 miles).

The shaking was felt in the country's capital, La Paz, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) away. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

The state-run Bolivian Information Agency said residents of various La Paz neighborhoods, particularly in the city's center, reported feeling the quake around 3 p.m. Some evacuated their homes, particularly those who live in taller buildings, the agency reported.

Preliminary estimates put the magnitude at 6.7, but authorities later revised the number.
