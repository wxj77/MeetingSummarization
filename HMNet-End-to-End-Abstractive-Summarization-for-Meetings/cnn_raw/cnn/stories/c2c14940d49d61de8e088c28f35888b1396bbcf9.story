Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- An insurgent attack on a Thai military camp in the country's south killed four soldiers and wounded six others, a military spokesman said Thursday.

"There were about 20 to 30 insurgents (who) attacked our permanent infantry camp in Maruebotok Village, Narathiwart province ... around 7:30 a.m. local time," said Col. Parinya Chaidilok, spokesman of the 4th Division of Internal Security Operation Command.

Parinya said the military had received a tip-off information that there would an attack on Thai military posts.

"But we are surprised that they launched their attack at our permanent camp instead of small temporary posts," he said.

Muslim separatists in southern Thailand have long battled government forces in a country that is overwhelmingly Buddhist. The conflict came to a head after former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra took office in 2004.

Several thousand people died in the violence.
