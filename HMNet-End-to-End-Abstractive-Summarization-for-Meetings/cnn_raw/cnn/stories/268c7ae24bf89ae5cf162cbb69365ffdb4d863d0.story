(EW.com) -- A "Mad Men" actor is going to ABC's "Pan Am" -- he doesn't even need to change decades!

Darren Pettie has had a recurring role on the AMC drama as the son of a cigarette mogul who was secretly gay (and recently had an arc on The CW's "Ringer"). Now Pettie has signed up for a recurring part on "Pan Am" playing an airline captain who's considered the "ultimate sky god."

He's a heroic former WWII pilot named Vince Broyles, a charmer with a dark side. Due to his acclaimed military service, he's allowed to commandeer "Pan Am" aircraft for his personal use.

Expect Pettie to struggle for Alpha Male status with Capt. Dean Lowrey (Mike Vogel) later this season.
