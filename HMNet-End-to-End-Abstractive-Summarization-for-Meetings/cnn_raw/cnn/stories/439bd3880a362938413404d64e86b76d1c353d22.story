(CNN) -- Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb said Tuesday he's "seriously looking" at a potential run for the Democratic nomination.

"We've had a lot of discussions among people I respect and trust," he said at the National Press Club in Washington. "And I'm seriously looking at the possibility of running for president, but we want to see if there's a support base from people who would support the programs we're interested in pursuing."

Asked if he would run as an independent or a Democrat, he said: "I'm a Democrat. I have strong reasons for being a Democrat."

"If you want true fairness in a society (and) you want to give a voice ... to the people who otherwise would not have it, I believe that would come from the Democratic Party."

Jim Webb weighs in on his political future

Webb left the Senate at the end of his first term in January 2013 and earlier this year published a book, "I Heard My Country Calling." From the time he left Congress until he released his new title, Webb largely stayed out of the limelight.

A veteran of the Vietnam War who also served as Navy secretary and assistant defense secretary, Webb weighed in at length about foreign affairs on Monday.

He has previously hinted that he had some policy differences with Hillary Clinton's tenure at the State Department, but he didn't get into specifics.

Asked if Clinton bears any responsibility for current problems the U.S. faces overseas, Webb said: "I think that's a question that really should be directed at Secretary Clinton. I'm not here to undermine her," he said. "I'm here just to explain where some of my concerns are."

Clinton is widely considered the Democratic favorite if she decides to run for president.

Along with Webb, Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley have not ruled out running for the Democratic nomination.
