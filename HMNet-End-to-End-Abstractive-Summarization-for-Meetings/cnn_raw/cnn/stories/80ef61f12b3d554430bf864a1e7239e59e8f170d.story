(CNN) -- Park Ji-Sung will sign a new two-year contract with Manchester United, according to the English football champions' manager Alex Ferguson.

The midfielder, 30, has one year remaining on his current deal, but Ferguson is confident the former South Korea star will commit his future to the club he joined from Dutch outfit PSV Eindhoven in 2005.

"He's been offered a new contract, yes," Ferguson, 69, told the Old Trafford team's official web site.

"I'm sure he'll sign it. His career at United has been nothing but excellent. He's a tremendous professional. I'm sure he'll accept a new offer and tie himself to the club for the next two years."

Park, who is in the U.S. on United's preseason tour, scored in the Red Devils' first two matches against New England Revolution and Seattle Sounders respectively.

Since arriving in Manchester, Park has picked up four Premier League titles and helped United become champions of Europe in 2008.

He won 100 international caps for his country and became the first Asian player to score at three successive World Cups with a goal against Greece in June 2010.

Park, who began his career with Japanese club Kyoto Purple Sanga, announced his retirement from international football on January 31.
