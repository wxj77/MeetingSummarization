(CNN) -- The bodies of a man and a girl were found inside a vehicle belonging to a suspect in an Amber Alert case, authorities said.

Authorities believe 2-year-old Madeline Samaan-Fay was abducted by her father, Mourad "Moni" Samaan. An Amber Alert was issued Friday for Madeline, who was last seen a week ago in Sacramento.

In a written statement, the FBI in Sacramento, California, said the bodies were found in Samaan's vehicle Saturday night but did not identify the bodies, saying more information would be released later.

The green Toyota 4Runner was found in a remote area of El Dorado County, near Placerville, California, the FBI said.

"The Amber Alert system has been put in place so that we can hopefully locate and safely take people back into custody and put the child back, if that's the case," El Dorado County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. Bryan Golmitz told CNN affiliate KCRA. "When you end up with cases like this, it's tough."

Calls made Sunday afternoon to the FBI and sheriff's office, inquiring about the identity of the two bodies were not immediately returned.

In an earlier news release, the FBI described the father as a 49-year-old Egyptian-born U.S. citizen. The federal agency called the circumstances of the abduction "particularly concerning," adding that officials have reason to believe that the child's life may be in danger.

The girl, Madeline, has brown hair and brown eyes, weighs about 28 pounds and stands 2 feet, 8 inches tall, according to the Amber Alert.

The FBI was working on the case along with members of the Sacramento Police Department, the Sacramento County Sheriff, the California Highway Patrol and the California Department of Justice.
