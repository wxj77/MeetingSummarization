London (CNN) -- The body found on Queen Elizabeth II's estate in Sandringham last week was a 17-year-old who had been missing since August, police said Sunday.

DNA tests helped detectives identified the woman as Alisa Dmitrijeva, Norfolk police said in a statement.

Police had been offering a Â£5000 reward for information leading to the missing teen.

Police have not said what caused her death, but said detectives are "investigating the murder."

In interviews with British newspapers last week, her family said they had immigrated from Latvia.

Investigators were alerted last Sunday to the human remains, found by a member of the public near the village of Anmer, in the English county of Norfolk.

Police are investigating activities that occurred around the site between the end of August and the end of September, Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry said in a statement.

"We would like to identify people who may have worked in that area or were involved in organizing or running any specific events that may have taken place," he said.

The body had been at the site between one and four months, the Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team said last week.

Sandringham House, at the heart of the rural estate, is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas. It's been the private home of four generations of British monarchs since 1862, and is one of two private residences used by the queen.

Part of the estate is a 600-acre country park open to the public.
