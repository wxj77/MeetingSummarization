(CNN) -- You've got to give the groundhog credit. He's getting every last drop out of his forecast of six more weeks of winter.

Just as the jonquils and tulips are poking their leaves above ground, a monster of a storm is sweeping across the Midwest, up the Great Lakes and into the Northeast.

Look at these snowfall predictions with the official start of spring just over a week away.

Chicago-area commuters could be facing up to 8 inches of fresh new snow as they head to work Wednesday.

Sorry Cleveland, it looks even worse for you. Close to a foot of snow is possible by the time the storm passes.

Blizzard warnings are up for western New York. Up to 18 inches of snow is forecast for Rochester. Winds will gust up to 44 mph.

Ready to cry uncle yet?

Burlington, Vermont, is in the cross hairs too. Folks there will see winds up to 32 mph. Snowfall could reach 20 inches before it's all over.

And so it goes, all the way into Maine. People in Bangor can look forward to up to 19 inches of snow before the system exits New England Thursday.

Out West, the weather's warming up, but even that comes with problems.

The melt from a heavier-than-normal snowpack has turned into flooding along the Bighorn River in north-central Wyoming, forcing folks from their homes.

"We actually have about 60 residences that we've evacuated," Worland Police Chief Gabe Elliott told CNN affiliate KCWY. "Probably around 80 people who reside in those residences."

Police are preparing for the worst, he said.

"The area's just getting larger and larger and further northbound," according to Elliott. "So it's definitely expanding as we speak."
