The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Thursday. The landmark 5-4 decision will dictate the way health care is administered to millions of Americans.

Here's a look at health care in the United States by the numbers, including the populations that could be most affected by the decision on what has come to be known as "Obamacare."

Obama: Health care ruling a victory for all Americans

49.9 million -- The number of uninsured Americans in 2010. That's 16.3% of the total population.

18.4% -- Percentage of uninsured Americans younger than 65 in 2010.

28.4% -- The percentage of Americans 25 to 34 without insurance.

7.3 million -- The number of children in the United States without health insurance, 9.8% of all children in the country.

15.4% - The percentage of children living in poverty who are also uninsured.

Ruling plays into campaign narrative for both sides

26.9% -- Percentage of people earning less than $25,000 a year who are also uninsured.

256.2 million -- The number of Americans who were insured in 2010.

195.9 million -- The number of Americans with private health insurance in 2010, 64% of the total population.

What the health care ruling means to you

169.3 million -- The number of Americans who get their insurance through the workplace.

95 million -- Number of people in the United States covered by government health insurance, 31% of the population.

44.3 million -- Number of Americans receiving Medicare coverage in 2010.

48.6 million -- The number of Americans covered by Medicaid in 2010.

$940 billion -- The amount of money the Congressional Budget Office estimates it will cost to provide the expanded insurance coverage over 10 years.

$143 billion -- The amount by which the plan could reduce the deficit over the first 10 years. And over the following decade, the CBO projected, health reform could reduce the deficit by more than $1 trillion, although the agency stressed such long-term projections are highly uncertain.

Timeline of the health care law

2.35% -- The tax rate high-income individuals would pay into Medicare, up from 1.45%. High-income is defined as individuals making more than $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly).
