(CNN) -- Serena Williams powered to her first Madrid Masters title, hitting 14 aces in a comfortable win over Victoria Azarenka in Sunday's final.

Williams took just over an hour to take the 41st WTA singles title of her career in a 6-1 6-3 win over the world No. 1.

The in-form Williams, who has won all 13 of her matches on clay this year, set the tone for a dominant performance by winning the first four games against an opponent that had lost just one set in the tournament before the final.

Williams hit 26 winners past the Belorussian, taking four of her five break-point chances and denying Azarenka's single break-point opportunity.

"I think Victoria is the player to beat," said Williams. "She has won I don't know how many tournaments this year alone. That's an amazing amount. So if you look at the stats, you just have to put her up there as the player to beat.

"I actually love the clay but my results haven't been stellar. I have won the French Open and lots of clay-court tournaments, though. It's really a myth about me not liking clay. I like it more than grass, which is weird. Hopefully I can start doing better."

Australian Open champion Azarenka had been looking for her fifth title this year, but was steamrollered by Williams.

"Being in the final of such a tournament is a good achievement," said Azarenka. "It's disappointing to lose but what can you do, it's done. I have to think about the positive things and take the best out of this week. I've been playing some great tennis."

Both players will be in action as the WTA Tour moves to Rome, where the field features nine of the world's top-10 players.

Serena's older sister Venus will play her second tournament since losing to Radwanska in the Miami quarterfinals in late March, having lost in the second round in Madrid.
