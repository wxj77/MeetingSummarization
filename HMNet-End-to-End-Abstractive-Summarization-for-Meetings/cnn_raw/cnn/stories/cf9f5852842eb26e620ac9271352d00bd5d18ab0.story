(CNN) -- World number three Roger Federer avenged his loss in the 2009 U.S. Open final as he defeated Juan Martin del Potro 6-3 7-5 in the second round of the Western and Southern Open on Tuesday.

Federer, a 16-time grand slam winner, managed to avoid a third-straight defeat to the 22-year-old, having previously lost to Del Potro at the 2009 ATP World Tour Finals.

The Swiss broke Del Potro, ranked 19 in the world, once in each set and sealed victory in one hour and 32 minutes.

"I expected a tough match with Juan Martin for obvious reasons, and it went better than I thought," Federer, who is looking to win the Cincinnati event for a record fifth time, told the ATP Tour's official web site.

Can anybody stop Novak and Serena?

"I thought I played a wonderful first set and a very good second set, too. That was obviously enough tonight. I don't think I really allowed Juan Martin to be able to play the game he usually plays."

Del Potro will now focus his attention on the U.S. Open, which gets underway on August 29, where he will return for the first time since his triumph two years ago.

Federer will face wildcard James Blake in the third round, after the American defeated Italy's Fabio Fognini 6-4 6-2.

Czech fifth seed Tomas Berdych also sealed victory on Tuesday as he picked up his fifth-career win over Del Potro's compatriot Juan Monaco.

In the remaining first round matches that were played, Wimbledon semifinalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Croat Marin Cilic 6-3 6-4.

The 15th seed will play American qualifier Alex Bogomolov Jr., who emerged from a clash with his wild card compatriot Robby Ginepri with a 6-4 6-3 success.

In an all-Spanish encounter, ninth seed Nicolas Almagro advanced at the expense of Albert Montanes with a 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 triumph.

Serbia's world number 20 Viktor Troicki is through after a 6-0 3-6 7-6 (7-5) victory over French qualifier Edouard Roger-Vasselin in a marathon match which lasted two hours and 29 minutes.
