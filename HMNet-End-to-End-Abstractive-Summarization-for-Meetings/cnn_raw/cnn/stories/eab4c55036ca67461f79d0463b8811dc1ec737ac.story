(CNN)The only question we have is, where is Rosie?

Viral star Sophia Grace Brownlee came to fame in 2011 after she and her cousin Rosie McClelland covered Nicki Minaj's "Super Bass" in an online video. That led to frequent appearances for the British tykes on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show."

Now, Sophia Grace has released a video for her single "Best Friends."

The 11-year-old looks like she took some cues from her idol Minaj (to whom Ellen famously introduced Sophia Grace and Rosie during their first appearance on her talk show) on the attitude one needs in order to carry off being a raptress.

"I take it to the top/I'm never gonna stop/11 years old, that's just how I rock," she raps.

There's plenty of preteen shopping, makeup and modeling sessions as Sophia Grace jams with her posse of "best friends."

Her first original song came in 2013, when she released the video for "Girls Just Gotta Have Fun."
