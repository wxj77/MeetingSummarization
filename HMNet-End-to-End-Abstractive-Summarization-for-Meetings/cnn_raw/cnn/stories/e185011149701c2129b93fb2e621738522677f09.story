(PEOPLE.com) -- Tim Robbins is taking action.

The actor, who famously supports liberal causes, joined with protesters Wednesday at the Occupy Wall Street rally in Lower Manhattan.

Robbins, 52, participated in the demonstration outside the Federal Courthouse in Foley Square.

"This is what an actual grassroots movement looks like," he tells the Financial Times. "It's a bit sloppy and disorganized but full of passion."

Demonstrators, who have been camped out in a park near Wall Street since mid-September, are protesting economic inequalities, corporate greed and the influence of corporate money on politics and government.

And Robbins, 52, isn't the only star who's been spotted at Occupy Wall Street. On Saturday, "Gossip Girl" star Penn Badgley, 24, was spotted snapping photos of the demonstrators in action.
