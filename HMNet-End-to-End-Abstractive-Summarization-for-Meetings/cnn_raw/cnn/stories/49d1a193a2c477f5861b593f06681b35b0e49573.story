PARIS, France -- Goals from Juninho and Sidney Govou gave Lyon a 2-0 home win over Valenciennes and enabled the six-time champions to stay four points ahead at the top of the French league.

Juninho opened the scoring for Lyon five minutes before the break.

Brazilian midfielder Juninho nudged in a Karim Benzema cross five minutes before the break and Govou lobbed in the second three minutes from time.

Lyon, who are at home to German champions VfB Stuttgart in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday, have 31 points from 13 matches.

Second-placed Nancy celebrated their 40th anniversary with a 1-0 win over Girondins Bordeaux.

Nancy, who have a game in hand, scored in the 29th minute when midfielder Chris Malonga headed in a cross from Youssouf Hadji.

Bordeaux stay fourth with 22 points from 13 games after their first away defeat of the season.

Third-placed Stade Rennes slumped to a 1-0 home defeat against Monaco, who had only picked up a point from their six previous league outings.

Frederic Piquionne headed home from a Nene corner kick for the visitors two minutes into the second half.

Troubled Paris St Germain clinched a 2-1 victory at Racing Strasbourg thanks to a Rodrigo own goal and 20-year-old midfielder Loris Arnaud's effort after 19 minutes.

Olympique Marseille were held to an embarrassing goalless draw by Lorient and remain third from bottom.

Coach Eric Gerets said:"The public have a right to be unhappy as the level of play in the second half wasn't worthy of Marseille.

"Taking the match as a whole you can have a harsh judgement. We made a few chances in the first half but we had a problem constructing moves from the back.

"In the second half we should have lost the match with the counter-attacks.

"We have to look at ourselves in the mirror, fight and work." E-mail to a friend
