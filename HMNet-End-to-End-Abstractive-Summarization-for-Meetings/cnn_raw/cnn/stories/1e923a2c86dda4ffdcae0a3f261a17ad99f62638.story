Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan was released from the Lynwood Correctional Facility early Monday morning after less than two weeks behind bars, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.

Lohan was released at 1:35 a.m. (4:35 a.m. ET), Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Benjamin Grubb said. He said she was taken to a treatment facility.

After Lohan was taken to jail July 20, a sheriff's spokesman said her stay would likely last between 13 and 15 days.

Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel sentenced Lohan to 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation.

But the sheriff, who runs the jail, has the power to release prisoners early because of jail overcrowding.

Lohan was also sentenced to spend 90 days in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program after her jail term is completed. Revel ordered Lohan to enter a program within 24 hours of leaving jail.

"I would like the transition to be sooner rather than later," Revel said last month.

She said Lohan's next court date would come a week after her release from jail, although if she is in a rehab program her lawyer can appear without her.

Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence, and in the second incident she was charged with cocaine possession.

The first arrest came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills.

Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car.

Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later, when she played identical twins in Disney's remake of "The Parent Trap."
