(CNN) -- Robin Williams received a warm sendoff from family and friends at a San Francisco tribute Saturday night.

The private event at the Curran Theatre was attended by such luminaries as Stevie Wonder, Eric Idle, Bobcat Goldthwait, Bonnie Hunt, Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Crystal. Wonder was among the performers, a rep for Williams confirmed.

Idle, the Monty Python legend, took to his Twitter account to talk about the show.

"Robin memorial beautiful & touching, tears and laughter, with Billy Crystal, Whoopie, & Stevie Wonder, & I sang a song I wrote for him," he tweeted.

"I sang Goodnight Robin, thanks for all the laughs...."

Idle also posted a few pictures of Williams.

In addition, as The Hollywood Reporter noted, Williams' daughter, Zelda -- who quit social media after being harassed in the wake of her father's death -- re-emerged last week with a pair of posts thanking people for their messages of kindness.

"I don't come online often, but reading of others who have dealt with this loss & gone on to live happy, full lives is helpful. Truly," she tweeted.

Robin Williams died August 11 at his home north of San Francisco. The death was ruled a suicide.
