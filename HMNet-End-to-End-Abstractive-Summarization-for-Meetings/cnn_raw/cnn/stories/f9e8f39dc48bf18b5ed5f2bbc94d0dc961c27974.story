Berlin (CNN) -- Two doctors who performed breast enlargement surgery on a German porn actress have been charged with negligent manslaughter after the woman's death, a prosecutor's spokesman said.

The 23-year-old woman, identified only as "Sexy Cora," fell into a coma during the surgery at the Alster Clinic in Hamburg on January 11, according to Wilhelm Moellers, the spokesman for the Hamburg state prosecutor. She died Thursday.

Doctors who responded to an emergency call to the clinic called police and filed charges that started the investigation of the clinic, Moellers said.

A statement from the clinic said the doctors were "extremely upset and deeply regret the death of patient C.W." and that they are giving "full and complete support" to investigators.

"As matters stand currently a defect in the anesthetizing device can be ruled out," the clinic statement said. "The claim that the monitoring could have given readings other than the actual vital functions of the patient has nothing to do with the facts and has no connection to reality."

An autopsy will take place next week and the cause of death "is still unclear," Moellers said.

"Erroneous behavior by the doctors is unproven and at this point just an 'assessment' by one of the emergency medical personnel who'd brought Ms. W to the University Clinic Hamburg," the clinic said. "Why the emergency doctor only appeared 20 to 25 minutes after the alarm was called is currently being checked."
