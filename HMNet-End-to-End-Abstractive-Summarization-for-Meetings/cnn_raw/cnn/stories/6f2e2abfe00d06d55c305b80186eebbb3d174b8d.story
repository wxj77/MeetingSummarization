(CNN) -- Looks like the former Jessa Duggar has made up for lost time.

The now Jessa Seewald posted a picture of her and her new husband, Ben, engaged in a kiss. As a Duggar, Jessa abided by the rule of no kissing before marriage and the couple are said to have stepped into a room to privately share their first kiss after they wed on November 1.

The new bride and her husband can be seen smooching in a picture she posted on her Instagram account with the caption, "It's great living life with your best friend!"

Fans of the hit TLC hit reality show "19 Kids & Counting" are familiar with the conservative Duggar family's rules of courtship.

Those rules include only side hugs when courting, no hand holding until engagement, chaperoned dates and saving that first kiss until the couple is legally wed. It appears Jessa may have bent one of those rules as she reportedly gave Ben a full on frontal hug after he proposed following a romantic scavenger hunt in August.

Fans got a chance to see the proposal and all that led up to it in a special titled "19 Kids & Counting: Jessa's Engagement" which aired this week. Their wedding will air on an upcoming episode.
