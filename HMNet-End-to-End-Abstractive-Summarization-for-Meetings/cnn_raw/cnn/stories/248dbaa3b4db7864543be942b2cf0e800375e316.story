(CNN) -- Beyonce isn't just one of the world's most influential people. She's also the world's most powerful celebrity, according to Forbes magazine.

The publication has released its annual Celebrity 100 list and has named Queen Bey to the top spot.

When you consider the year she's had, there's little reason to wonder why. After giving what many viewed as a virtually flawless performance at the 2013 Super Bowl Halftime Show, Beyonce hasn't paused, embarking on a grand global tour while also readying the release of her self-titled visual album, "Beyonce."

When that disc arrived to fans' pleasant surprise in December 2013, the singer notched her fifth No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, and sparked a platinum hit with the lead single, "Drunk in Love." (Monica Lewinsky referenced the record when talking about her past with former President Bill Clinton.)

And yet, as Forbes notes, Beyonce's empire isn't limited to the music business. While she's setting out on joint tours with her husband -- they're currently crossing the country with their "On the Run" trek -- Beyonce's also managing her clothing company, line of perfumes, and collaborations with brands like Pepsi and H&M.

All told, Forbes estimates that Beyonce earned roughly $115 million between June 2013 and June 2014. By comparison, her husband made an estimated $60 million, enough to put him in sixth place behind Oprah Winfrey (No. 4 at $82 million) and Ellen DeGeneres (No. 5, at $70 million).

So who's the person standing directly in Beyonce's shadow? That would be basketball star LeBron James, who arrived at No. 2 on Forbes' Celebrity 100 list, having made an estimated $72 million as of June 2014.
