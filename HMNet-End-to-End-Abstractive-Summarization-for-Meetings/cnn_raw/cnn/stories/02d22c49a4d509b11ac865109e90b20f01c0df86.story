(CNN) -- Is the ring the thing?

Rumors are flying that Lady Gaga and her boyfriend, "Chicago Fire" actor Taylor Kinney, either have made things "official" with a commitment ceremony or are soon to head down the aisle.

The talk heated up two weeks ago after actress Sophia Bush shared a photo on Instagram of Kinney wearing a ring on a significant finger. The post came complete with the hashtags #ThatsHisPersonalRing #NotForTheShow #EveryoneCalmDown.

The Daily Star reported this week that Gaga and Kinney gathered friends and family for a small ceremony pledging their devotion to each other. Citing unnamed sources, the publication claims the couple plan to officially wed next year.

Neither the singer nor the actor has commented on the reports.

The singer and her beau -- who have dated since 2011 -- have managed to keep their relationship out of the limelight. She told Howard Stern in a 2013 interview that the pair are "very protective" of their romance.

"We treat each other with a lot of care, and we're good to one another," she said.
