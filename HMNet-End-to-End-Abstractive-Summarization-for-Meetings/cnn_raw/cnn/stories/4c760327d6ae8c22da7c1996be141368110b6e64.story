(CNN) -- At least six people were killed and more than a dozen others injured when explosions hit a campaign rally for one of Afghanistan's two presidential runoff candidates at a hotel in Kabul on Friday, an Interior Ministry spokesman said.

The convoy of candidate Abdullah Abdullah was attacked in Kabul, spokesman Sediq Sediqqi told CNN.

Abdullah and his running mates were not hurt, but the candidate's car was severely damaged, Sediqqi said.

There were two explosions, Sediqqi said: One was a suicide attack and the other a possible roadside bomb.

Video from the scene showed hotel windows blown out and police securing the area.

Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani are campaigning for Afghanistan's June 14 runoff election to succeed Hamid Karzai.

Abdullah, a former foreign minister, garnered 45% of the vote in the first round, and Ghani, a former finance minister, earned 31%.
