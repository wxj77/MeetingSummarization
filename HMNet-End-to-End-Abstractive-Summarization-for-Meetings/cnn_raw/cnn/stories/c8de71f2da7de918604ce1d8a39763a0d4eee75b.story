(CNN)A suicide bomb attack in Iraq this week was carried out by an American jihadist, ISIS claims.

The terrorist group released a photograph on Tuesday of a masked fighter it identified as Abu Daood Al-Amriki, an alleged American jihadist who committed the suicide attack.

The claim grabbed headlines, but days later, neither CNN nor U.S. government officials have been able to confirm the identity of the attacker.

ISIS claims the attacker used an explosives-laden vehicle to mount an attack in Samarra, Iraq.

Two senior Iraqi security officials confirmed that an attack matching the description did take place -- that a suicide attacker rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into a convoy of Iraqi forces.

At least three Iraqi security forces were killed in the attack, the sources said.

But ISIS has not released the birth name of the alleged American suicide bomber, or shown his face. U.S. officials tell CNN that for the moment there is nothing to corroborate the claim.
