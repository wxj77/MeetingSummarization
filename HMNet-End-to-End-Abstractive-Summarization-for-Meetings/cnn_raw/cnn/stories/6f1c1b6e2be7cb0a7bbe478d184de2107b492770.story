(CNN) -- This month, Inside the Middle East celebrates its 100th episode with a special look at education, focusing on the ways Egypt, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates are developing their future generation of leaders.

From Egypt's bustling capital Cairo, to the coastal city of Alexandria, IME host Rima Maktabi meets young Egyptians who explain the challenges of studying -- or simply learning how to read -- in a nation currently undergoing a rocky transition to democracy.

IME then travels to Beirut and learns why most Lebanese students are not taught some of the basic history of their nation's 15-year civil war.

Finally, in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi, we meet world-famous Iraqi musician Naseer Shamma, a man devoting his life to teaching young people the history and melodies of the oud, a traditional Middle Eastern guitar heard in most songs across the region.

Wednesday June 6: 0930, 1630,
Saturday June 9: 0430, 1830,
Sunday June 10: 1130,
