(CNN) -- As the world continues to hope for a cease-fire between Israel and militants in Gaza following days of deadly violence, one Israeli decided to take matters to social media.

Ido Simyoni, a television producer from Israel, decided to start a project asking people to post images on photo-sharing service Instagram and tag them #stoptheterror.

The result? More than 5,000 photos as of Monday from as far afield as Portugal and South Korea, he said. "Terror is everywhere and it doesn't matter if you are from Tel Aviv or NYC, you can get attacked," he added.

While he started the project with his own country in mind, he says it could apply to any nation. "I come with peace to this project hoping to increase the awareness of how it is important to defeat terror everywhere," he said.
