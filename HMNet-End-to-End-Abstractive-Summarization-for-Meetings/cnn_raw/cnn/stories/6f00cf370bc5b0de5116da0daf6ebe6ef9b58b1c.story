A teen shot by his cousin during last month's rampage at a Washington state high school has died, bringing the total fatalities to five, including the gunman.

Andrew Fryberg, 15, was hospitalized after the October 24 shooting in the cafeteria of Marysville Pilchuck High School.  He died Friday.

In a statement announcing his death, the family thanked Harborview Medical Center for his care and asked for privacy.

"Our family is overwhelmed with the love and care that has been provided to our loved one during this time and you all will forever hold a special place in our hearts," the statement said.

The four victims died on different days.

In addition to  Fryberg,  Zoe Galasso died at the scene while Gia Soriano and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit died days later. All the latter three girls were age 14.

Another student, Nate Hatch, 14, recovered and was released from hospital this week. Hatch and the latest victim were cousins of the gunman, Jaylen Fryberg, 15, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene.

The boys were close friends, nearly inseparable and lived close to one another, their grandfather, Don Hatch, said last month.

The popular freshman opened fire in the crowded lunchroom last month at the school in Marysville, about 30 miles north of Seattle.

All the victims were invited to the same lunch table by the shooter, authorities said.

Shortly before the attack, the gunman sent a selfie to an ex-girlfriend of himself holding a gun, a law enforcement official said. It is unclear if it is the same .40 caliber pistol he pulled out of a black backpack and fired.

It's unclear how many shots were fired, but he had at least one bullet left when teacher Megan Silberberger confronted him.

He used the final shot to end his life, authorities said.
