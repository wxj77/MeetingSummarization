(CNN) -- An online campaign to get One Direction to visit a Colorado teen critically wounded at school has led to a video message from the British boy band.

Claire Davis, 17, is in a coma in a Littleton, Colorado, hospital six days after another senior at Arapahoe High School shot her and then took his own life.

Friends, who said Davis is a big One Direction fan, began a Twitter campaign to get the group's attention using the hashtag #Get1DtoClaire.

The group recorded a 13-second video message and sent it directly to Claire's family, a source close to One Direction told CNN Thursday. While it was not intended to be shared online, her boyfriend apparently uploaded it to YouTube, the source said.

The video shows singer Liam Payne delivering the message as the other four members stand by.

"Hi, Claire. We've heard you were a big fan and we just wanted to show you some love," Payne said. "What's happened to you is absolutely terrible, something we can't bear thinking about, so we just wanted to share some love with you. All our prayers are with you and your family. Hope you get well soon. Lots of love."

Louis Tomlinson then blew a kiss toward the camera.

The group couldn't be with Claire, but wanted to do something for her, the source said.

Word of the One Direction video spread quickly on Twitter Thursday.

"Guys 1D found out about Claire," read one tweet linking to the YouTube message.

"In case you haven't seen this....#get1Dtoclaire worked!!!! So so proud of everyone," said another.

The shooter, identified as 18-year-old Karl Pierson, was looking for revenge against a librarian, but couldn't find the faculty member. He killed himself as a school resource officer closed in, police said. Davis was a random victim, police surmised, and the gunman and victim didn't know each other.
