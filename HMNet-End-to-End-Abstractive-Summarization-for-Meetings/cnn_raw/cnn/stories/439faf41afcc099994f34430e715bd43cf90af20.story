(EW.com) -- Things we know Gotye doesn't like: cardboard boxes, dinkiness, and "Glee's" version of his #1 single "Somebody That I Used to Know."

The Belgian-born Australian artist criticized Darren Criss and Matt Bomer's cover of the runaway hit, telling the Sunday Herald Sun that the show "made it sound dinky and wrong."

"They did such a faithful arrangement of the instrumentals," the singer admitted. "But the vocals were that pop 'Glee style,' ultra-dry, sounded pretty tuned."

"And the rock has no real sense," he continued. "Like it's playing to you from a cardboard box."

Perhaps not coincidentally, the Gotye song reached the top of Billboard's Hot 100 in its fifteenth week on the charts -- which was the week directly following the "Glee" episode. (Then again, he did appear as the musical guest on "Saturday Night Live" that week as well).

The Glee version, meanwhile, debuted at 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at 10 on the Digital Songs chart.
