(CNN Student News) -- October 10, 2013

CNN Student News goes global to start Thursday's show, covering stories from Egypt, Syria and Brazil. Then, we discuss President Obama's Federal Reserve chair nominee, who would be the first woman to lead the country's central bank if she's confirmed. Plus, we examine the possible ripple effects of the U.S. government hitting its debt ceiling.
