(CNN) -- Colorado authorities on Thursday arrested a man wanted in connection with the March shooting death of state prison chief Tom Clements.

Thomas Guolee -- referred to as a "person of interest in the Tom Clements murder investigation" -- was taken into custody "on an active felony arrest warrant by local authorities in Colorado Springs" around 5:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET), the El Paso, Colorado, County Sheriff's Office said.

Two hours later, he was being held on "a no bond hold for violation of parole" at the El Paso County Sheriff's Office Criminal Justice Center.

Law enforcement authorities in El Paso County and Colorado Springs did not immediately respond to requests Thursday night from CNN for more information, including on how Guolee was arrested and what the arrest warrant was for.

A search of the Colorado Department of Corrections' website indicated that Guolee is 31 and had been on parole.

Authorities have said they suspect Evan Ebel shot Clements outside his Colorado home. Ebel died two days later in a shootout with authorities in Texas.

Another man, James Lohr, was arrested in the same case earlier this month, also in Colorado Springs. He and Guolee were both associated with Ebel in the days before Clements' death, a source close to the investigation said.

Police have described Lohr and Guolee as associates of the white supremacist 211 Crew gang, a group that included Ebel.

Investigators have said they were looking into whether Ebel might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements.

Clements was widely recognized for cracking down on prison gangs, including the 211 Crew.

Ebel -- who had been convicted for an armed robbery and punching a prison guard -- was released early on parole because of a clerical error. He also is suspected in the killing of part-time pizza deliveryman Nathan Leon shortly before Clements was shot dead.
