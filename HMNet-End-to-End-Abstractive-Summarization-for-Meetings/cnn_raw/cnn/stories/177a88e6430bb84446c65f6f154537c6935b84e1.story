Washington (CNN) -- After winning her 13th term to the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday, the last thing Rep. Rosa DeLauro expected from a whirlwind week was an armed break-in at her Capitol Hill home.

The 71-year-old Democrat, who represents Connecticut's 3rd Congressional District, was not home at the time of the incident early Friday evening. However her husband, political strategist Stan Greenberg, arrived while the burglar was inside.

According to an email sent to the community, police said Greenberg saw the burglar holding a large knife when he stepped into the bedroom. Police were alerted about the break-in by the time Greenberg entered the home and were at the scene moments later.

Sara Lonardo, DeLauro's communications director, confirmed the break-in and said that police arrested the burglar at the scene.

"[Rep. DeLauro and her husband] thank the Metropolitan Police Department and Capitol Police for their response and are grateful no one was harmed," Lonardo said in a statement on Monday.

According to police reports obtained by ABC 7 News, police identified the man as John Chaplin, 55, from Southeast D.C. He reportedly stole a Mickey Mouse pin, costume hat, necklace, laptop, and digital picture frame.

It is unknown whether Chaplin targeted DeLauro's Capitol Hill home or if he acted randomly.
