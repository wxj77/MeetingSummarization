(CNN) -- Fallen For You sprang a surprise at Royal Ascot to win the Coronation Stakes in convincing fashion from Starscope and Irish History.

It capped a fine day for jockey William Buick and trainer John Gosden, who triumphed in three of Friday's races.

Elsewhere, the Queen finally scored a winner at Royal Ascot after two disappointing outings earlier this week.

In the Coronation Stakes, the day's feature race for three-year-old fillies, the pre-race trio of favorites Homecoming Queen, Laugh Out Loud and Samitar set a strong early pace.

Homecoming Queen, who won the 1,000 Guineas in similar front-running style, was aiming to help Joseph O'Brien to his second win at Royal Ascot after So You Think on Wednesday.

But she was overhauled in the final furlong by a powerful burst of speed by the Gosden-trained 12-1 shot, ridden by Buick.

Buick earlier won the Albany Stakes on Newfangled and later clinched the Wolferton Handicap on Gatewood.

He moves top of the jockey's standings for this year's Royal Ascot meeting with four wins in total.

The Queen's filly Estimate won the Queen's Vase (Group 3) for her first Royal Ascot winner since Free Agent in 2008.

Estimate powered ahead of rivals with two furlongs to go, with a huge cheer erupting from the grandstand as she crossed the winning post under jockey Ryan Moore.
