Atlanta (CNN) -- Atlanta police have issued an arrest warrant for rapper Gucci Mane who allegedly struck a man on the head with a champagne bottle at a downtown Atlanta nightclub.

The man told police he tried to begin a conversation with the rapper at the Harlem Nights Ultra Lounge club when he was "suddenly struck."

The attack left a deep gash on the man's head, Atlanta police Sgt. Greg Lyon said.

"I'm in the military. I wanted to get a picture with Gucci Mane," the man told CNN affiliate WSB-TV. "I was speaking to the security guard, and Gucci Mane hit me in the head with a bottle."

The man, whom the affiliate identified only as James, said a second man then hit him on the side of the face.

The incident took place on March 16 in the VIP section of the club during a mix-tape release party.

The 33-year-old rapper, whose real name is Radric Davis, is now wanted for aggravated assault.

His reps were not immediately available for comment.
