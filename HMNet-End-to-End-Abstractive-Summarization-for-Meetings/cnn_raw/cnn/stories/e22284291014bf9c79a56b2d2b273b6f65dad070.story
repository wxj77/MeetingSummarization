2014 has been a big year for towering new skyscrapers -- literally.

One World Trade Center became the biggest skyscraper in the United States when construction was completed in early November while ground was broken on the Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which will rise one kilometer skywards to become the world's tallest building when completed in five year's time.

But what does 2015 have in store?

We've compiled a list of the ten tallest buildings set for completion in 2015 using data held by the Skyscraper Center, the global tall building database.

Unsurprisingly, some of the world's fastest developing cities are at the forefront of plans that will come to fruition in 2015.
