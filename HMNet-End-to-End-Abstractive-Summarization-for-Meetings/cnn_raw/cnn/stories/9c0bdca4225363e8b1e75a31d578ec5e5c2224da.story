(CNN) -- It seems there's no such thing as time off for Jay Z and Beyonce.

On Tuesday, Dash Radio's DJ Skee reported that the "Drunk in Love" duo have plans to collaborate on a joint album, according to sources close to the couple. DJ Skee believes the album could arrive in late 2014 or early 2015.

When asked about the report, a Jay Z spokesperson told CNN, "Please ask DJ Skee."

Such reticence about rumors has been standard procedure for the power couple, whose "On the Run" tour opened in June under speculation of a pending divorce but ended last weekend in Paris with gossip of another pregnancy.

The couple -- who wed in 2008 and are also parents to 2-year-old Blue Ivy Carter -- earned $100 million in ticket sales from their stadium trek, Billboard reported. In 2013, Forbes named Jay Z and Beyonce the highest-paid couple in entertainment.

Speaking to E!, which first reported the news, Dash Radio's vice president of pop programming, Karli Henriquez, called the reported collaboration "huge."

If the album comes to pass, that could turn out to be an understatement.
