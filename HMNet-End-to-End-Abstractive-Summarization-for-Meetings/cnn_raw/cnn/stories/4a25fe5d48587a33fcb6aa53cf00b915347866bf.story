(CNN) -- Mark Kessler, the small-town Pennsylvania police chief who posted videos of himself firing automatic weapons while cursing about gun control, has been given a termination notice.

The borough council of Gilberton, population 750, voted 6-1 to fire him at a meeting Thursday night, said council chairman Daniel J. Malloy.

Kessler was suspended July 31 at a council meeting that drew thousands of his supporters, including some openly armed, to the small town in Schuylkill County in eastern Pennsylvania

He will remain on suspension for 10 days to give him time to appeal, Malloy said. He would not comment further.

"We knew it was coming," Kessler said after the vote, CNN affiliate WFMZ-TV reported.

Kessler's attorney, Joseph Nahas, said he will request a public hearing next week, the affiliate reported.

The council accused Kessler of misusing borough property, neglecting his duties and failing to turn over weapons to the borough, his lawyer said.

But Kessler said the firing is "because of my videos."

In the videos, he rails against liberals for attempting to curb gun rights and Secretary of State John Kerry for supporting an arms treaty. At one point in a video, he dares Kerry to come and take his guns.
