(CNN) -- Longtime ABC News personality Barbara Walters was being treated for a cut on her forehead Sunday after a fall in Washington, the network said.

Walters, 83, suffered the cut after falling on a stair Saturday evening while visiting the British ambassador's residence, ABC News Senior Vice President Jeffrey Schneider said in a statement.

"Out of an abundance of caution, she went to the hospital to have her cut tended to, have a full examination and remains there for observation," Schneider said. "Barbara is alert (and telling everyone what to do), which we all take as a very positive sign."

Walters spent two decades as co-host and correspondent for ABC's news magazine show "20/20." She still reports on occasion.

Since 1997, she has been co-host of ABC's daytime talk show "The View."
