It's a disease that affects millions of women in Africa, yet talking about it has been considered a taboo, and that silence has been deadly.

Nigeria's Princess Nikky Onyeri has dedicated her life to speaking out to raise awareness about breast cancer in Africa. Princess Nikky Onyeri is not a member of a royal family, "Princess" is a given name, but for many of Nigeria's cancer survivors she is their princess. It's a passionate cause that defines her life.

Based in Abuja, Nigeria, Onyeri has lobbied the Government to do more to help women with cancer. The impetus behind her drive and persistence is a wrong diagnosis of cancer 15 years ago.
