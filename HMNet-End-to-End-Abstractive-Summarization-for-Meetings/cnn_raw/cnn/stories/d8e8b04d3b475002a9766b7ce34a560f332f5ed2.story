(CNN) -- Canadian authorities are trying to determine what caused a jetliner to crash near the remote Arctic outpost of Resolute Bay, killing 12 people.

The jet, operated by Ontario-based carrier First Air, went down about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the airport on Saturday, First Air Vice President Chris Ferris told reporters Sunday. The dead included the four-member crew and eight of the 11 passengers aboard the Boeing 737-200, he said.

"At this time, the cause of the accident is unknown," he said. "The Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation, and First Air is cooperating fully."

Two of the three survivors were flown to Ottawa, more than 2,000 miles away, for further treatment, Ferris said. His voice cracked as he thanked Canadian troops for assisting in rescue efforts.

First Air flight 6560 was lost about 12:40 p.m. Saturday, about 10 minutes after its last reported communication with controllers, the airline reported. The flight took off from Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories.

Firefighters, medical teams, police and members of the Canadian military were among the first to respond to the accident, according to Dominique Verdon, a spokeswoman with Canada's Department of National Defence.

Authorities recovered the jet's flight recorders at the crash site, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported Saturday. Boeing offered its "deepest sympathies" to the families of the victims and said Canadian investigators have asked it to provide technical assistance for the investigation.
