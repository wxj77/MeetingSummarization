(CNN) -- A man has died in an incident at the official residence of Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt in Stockholm, Swedish police confirmed Friday.

The incident is not being treated as terrorism, and the man who died is not connected with the Swedish government, a police spokeswoman said.

Investigations are continuing into the circumstances of his death. His family still has to be informed, police said.

Reinfeldt was not at the residence at the time of the incident, spokesman Markus Friberg told CNN.

"I can confirm that the prime minister was not in the building; he was in a meeting in another place. He and his family are fine. Police are trying to get more details about this incident," Friberg said.

CNN's Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.
