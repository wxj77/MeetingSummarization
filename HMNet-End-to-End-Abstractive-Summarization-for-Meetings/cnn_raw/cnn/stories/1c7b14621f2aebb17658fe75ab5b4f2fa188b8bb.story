(CNN) -- The father of Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney has been arrested and bailed by Merseyside Police over an inquiry into suspicious betting patterns concerning a Scottish Premier League match last year.

Wayne Rooney Senior, 48, was one of nine people arrested on suspicion of fraud, relating to a match between Motherwell and Hearts on December 14 2010.

The eight other people arrested and bailed include Rooney's uncle, Richie, 54, and Liverpool-born midfielder Steve Jennings, 26, who plays for Scottish side Motherwell.

A police statement read: "Merseyside Police can confirm that all of the nine men arrested on Thursday October 6 as part of an investigation into suspicious betting activity have now been released on police bail pending further inquiries.

"All nine were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and all have been released on police bail until late January while inquiries continue. The joint investigation by Merseyside Police and the Gambling Commission remains ongoing."

Rooney's father later released his own statement in which he vigorously denied allegations of being involved in a football betting scam and was "co-operating fully" with the police investigation.

Solicitor Anthony Barnfather, who is representing Rooney Senior, said in a statement: "Mr Rooney vigorously denies all of these allegations. We are co-operating fully with the investigation. No further comment will be made at this time."

Rooney is currently with the England squad preparing for the Euro 2012 qualifier against Macedonia on Friday and England coach Fabio Capello told media that his star forward was fully concentrated on the upcoming match, where a draw will seal England's qualification.

Capello said: " I have spoken to Wayne and found him relaxed and calm. There is no problem for the game against Montenegro and he is sure a solution will be found to this personal problem in a very short space of time."
