(CNN) -- Sure hope Amal isn't upset.

George Clooney took an apparent break from his honeymoon with Amal Alamuddin to make a surprise appearance Thursday at New York Comic Con. The actor, who was there to talk about his role in next summer's "Tomorrowland," admitted he wondered himself what he was doing there.

"It is not lost on me that I am spending my honeymoon at Comic Con," said Clooney, according to several reports from the event.

Marriage seems to be treating Clooney well so far. He kept the crowd entertained with one-liners and enthusiasm.

Nodding to co-star Hugh Laurie, who played Dr. Gregory House on "House," Clooney issued a challenge to other actors who played doctors on television. (Clooney played Dr. Doug Ross on "ER.")

"We were all over the world -- Hugh and I got to get in trouble in the Bahamas, it was fun. Two former television doctors! Bring on that McSteamy guy! We'll take 'em all on, them TV doctors," he said.

And noting his quick appearance in the "Tomorrowland" trailer, Clooney worked up a phony bluster.

"What the hell, that's it? We've been waiting for this thing for a year and a half and that's it?" he said. "I'm so barely in the teaser! I don't want to have to say, I'm a big star!"

"Tomorrowland," directed by Brad Bird ("The Incredibles") and written by Bird and Damon Lindelof, opens in May 2015.
