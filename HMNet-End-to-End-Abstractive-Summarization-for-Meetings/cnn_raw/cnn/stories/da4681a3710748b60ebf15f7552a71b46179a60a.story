Mount Ontake erupted late Saturday morning, sending a plume of smoke and ash into the sky, the Japan Meteorological Agency reported.

At least three people have been injured, said a task force in Otaki village, just south of the volcano. They have observed 17-20 inches (40-50 centimeters)  of volcanic ash covering the ground.

Local authorities said there were roughly 150 hikers in the area at the time, according to the agency, which raised the Volcanic Alert Level for Ontake from 1 to 3.
