Washington (CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama doesn't approve: "Don't you hate when trailers give away the whole movie?" she says, sitting on the couch with two staffers while chomping on a carrot. "Can't we just watch 'Frozen' again?"

Instead she watched parts of a horror flick on the degradation of American's health as junk-food eating and soda-drinking teens turn into sick zombies after gorging themselves with sugary foods and drinks.

Yes, it's a joke. It's a new video on the comedy website Funny or Die. The first lady's brief appearance in "Snackpocalpyse," a spoof thriller with actors ChloÃ« Grace Moretz and Tyler Posey in a post-apocalyptic modern-day high school where junk food kills the students, falls in line with her focus on healthy eating and her Let's Move! campaign.

But don't worry. As in most Hollywood films, things work out in the end. Heroine Moretz attempts to save the world with her healthy eating. We aren't sure, however, if Obama gets to watch Frozen.

President Barack Obama was the first Obama to appear on the comedy website in an episode of "Between Two Ferns" during the rollout of the health care law. It was credited as introducing a host of young people to the health care law.
