(PEOPLE.com) -- Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher announced their split on Thursday, but tensions have been building for some time.

"Ashton is unhappy; [Demi]'s unhappy," a source tells PEOPLE. "It just got to a point where they had to end it."

Despite longtime problems, the exes did try to work on their relationship. Unfortunately, their issues -- which went beyond Kutcher's alleged infidelities -- couldn't be resolved.

"The fighting could get pretty intense," an additional source says of Kutcher, 33, and Moore, 49. "Whatever counseling they did was fine for a quick fix but could not get to the heart of the problem."
