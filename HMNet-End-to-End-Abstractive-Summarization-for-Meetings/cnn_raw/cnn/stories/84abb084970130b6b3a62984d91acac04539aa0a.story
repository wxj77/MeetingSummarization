(Rolling Stone) -- Justin Bieber has revealed that his upcoming album "Believe," his third, will feature a songwriting collaboration with Taylor Swift.

The U.K.'s Capital FM Radio posted audio yesterday from a recent conversation with Bieber on the program Vodafone Big Top 40 in which Bieber announced the country-pop singer-songwriter will join Believe's all-star guest list.

When asked whether the Swift collaboration would have a country flavor, Bieber replied in the affirmative and explained that "Believe" will reflect a diverse range of styles.

"It doesn't stay in a box," he explained. "Everything is so different and that's why I'm so happy with this album."

Other "Believe" guests include Drake, Kanye West, Timbaland and Diplo. On Monday, Bieber announced on Twitter that the album will also include a duet with Usher. "Believe" is expected to come out this summer.
