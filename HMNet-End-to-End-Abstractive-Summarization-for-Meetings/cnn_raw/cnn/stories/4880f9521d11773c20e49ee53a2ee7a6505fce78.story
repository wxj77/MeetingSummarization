(CNN) -- Rob Lowe's vacation in France took a scary turn on Wednesday because of one very bad storm.

The 50-year-old actor and his family had to be rescued from their vacation home in Grasse, France, after heavy downpours caused frightening floods.

"That's the first floor of our house submerged," Lowe's son Johnny captioned an Instagram photo that has since been removed. "Scariest hour or so of my life."

Lowe shared another photo of the rapidly moving water, which was "right outside the house," he wrote. "Was twice as high at the worst, just before sunrise."

Local officials told People magazine that the Lowes had just experienced "the biggest storm of the year."

"Water rising like that can be terrifying," one official said to the magazine. "There's only one rescue station in Grasse, and this storm required assistance from several other regional units. We were called out on a lot of emergency rescues yesterday."

The Lowe family was one of them. As the "Parks and Recreation" star's son shared on Twitter, the family is grateful to the first responders who came through.

"Thank you to the fireman that saved us from this nightmare," Johnny posted. "Happy for us all to be safe, thoughts to others."
