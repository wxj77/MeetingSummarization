Los Angeles (CNN) -- "American Idol" creator Simon Fuller filed a lawsuit Wednesday claiming he should be paid for the U.S. version of "The X Factor."

Fuller claims a 2005 contract gives him executive producer credit and fees for the show, which was created by former "Idol" judge Simon Cowell.

"Mr. Fuller has prudently attempted to settle this matter privately but the other parties have refused to honor the original contract, leaving him no other choice but to pursue legal action," his publicist said in a statement Wednesday.

But "X-Factor" and "Idol" producer FremantleMedia and Fox Broadcasting Co., which carries both shows, say Fuller had no role in the new show and is not due any cash.

"Mr. Fuller has not been hired, nor performed any duties, on the U.S. version of "The X Factor," the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday. "His suit seeks payment and credit as an executive producer despite his neither having been approved by the required parties, nor hired, as such."

The U.S. versions of "Idol" and "X-Factor" are both based on British shows.

CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.
