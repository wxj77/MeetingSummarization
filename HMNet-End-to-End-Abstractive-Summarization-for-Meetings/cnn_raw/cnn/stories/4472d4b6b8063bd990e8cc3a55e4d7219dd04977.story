(CNN) -- Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are used to meeting in grand slam finals, but the dominance of Novak Djokovic in 2011 means the two great rivals will feature in the same half of the draw for the first time in seven years at the Australian Open.

The former world No. 1s, who have clashed in eight title deciders, could meet in the semifinals of the tennis season's opening major, which begins in Melbourne on Monday.

Federer, seeking to extend his record of 16 grand slam titles, will start against a qualifier, as will Nadal -- bidding for his 11th elite crown.

Defending champion Djokovic, however, will start out against Italy's 108th-ranked Paolo Lorenzi as he starts a campaign that could see him meet last year's runner-up Andy Murray in the last four.

Fourth seed Murray, who lost to Federer in the 2010 final, begins against American 19-year-old Ryan Harrison, ranked 84th.

In the women's draw, world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki is top seed for the sixth grand slam in a row. The Dane, who is yet to win one of the four grand slams, starts off against Australia's Anastasia Rodionova.

Second seed Petra Kvitova, who could move to the top of the world rankings in Melbourne, has been drawn to face world No. 84 Vera Dushevina of Russia.

Sixth seed Samantha Stosur, who became Australia's first winner of a women's grand slam singles title in 31 years at the 2011 U.S. Open, will play Romania's 60th-ranked Sorana Cirstea.

Elsewhere, Chinese fifth seed and 2011 French Open champion Li Na faces Kazakhstan's Ksenia Pervak, while three-time grand slam winner and fourth seed Maria Sharapova will play Argentina's Gisela Dulko.
