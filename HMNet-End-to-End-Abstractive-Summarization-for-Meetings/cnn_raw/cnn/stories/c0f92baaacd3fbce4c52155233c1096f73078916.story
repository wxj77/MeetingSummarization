(CNN) -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff when he was governor of Arkansas is expected to turn herself in after authorities issued a bench warrant for her arrest for allegedly smuggling contraband into a state prison, her attorney told CNN Wednesday.

Betsey Wright served Clinton as chief of staff for 7 years in Arkansas and ran 3 successful campaigns for governor.

Betsey Wright allegedly smuggled a red Doritos bag containing 48 tattoo needles, a pen with tweezers and a needle inside, a Swiss Army knife and a box cutter into the Varner Unit, a high-security state prison in Grady, Arkansas, according to the bench warrant.

She will turn herself in next week, Jeff Rosenzweig, Wright's attorney, said.

Wright is an advocate for prisoners and has befriended a number of inmates at Varner, Rosenzweig said.

"We are very disappointed the prosecutor has chosen to issue charges," he said.

"We have no choice but to seek vindication in court."

Wright served Clinton as chief of staff for seven years in Arkansas and ran his successful campaigns for governor in 1982, 1984 and 1986.
