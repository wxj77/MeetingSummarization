(CNN) -- A 73-year-old man shot dead five people around Yuma, Arizona, before turning a gun on himself, police said.

Another victim was flown about 180 miles northeast to a Phoenix-area hospital after being seriously injured, Yuma Police Sgt. Clint Norred said in a joint press release with the Yuma County Sheriff's Office.

According to Yuma police, an "elderly male" went into a business in the city limits and shot an adult male. Police Chief Jerry Geier later identified this victim as Jerrold Shelley, a local attorney.

The four others were killed in greater Yuma County, where the other person was injured, according to Yuma Police Officer Cruz Vidal.

Police determined that these shootings were linked and identified the suspect as Carey Hal Dyess, a 73-year-old Yuma man.

Around 11:30 a.m., Yuma County sheriff's deputies found Dyess dead off U.S. Highway 95 in Blaisdell, a community east of Yuma. He died from "what appears to be ... a self-inflicted gunshot wound," police said.

Yuma is a city of more than 87,000 people, according to a 2006 U.S. Census Bureau estimate, out of nearly 200,000 people in the county. It is near the intersection of Arizona, California and Mexico, about 170 miles east of San Diego.
