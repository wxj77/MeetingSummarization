(CNN) -- Torontonians love Rob Ford. His brother? Not so much.

Ford, the crack-smoking, wise-cracking, scandal-soaked mayor, coasted to an easy win on the Toronto city council Monday night.

His brother, Doug Ford, who ran for Ford's old job as mayor -- lost.

Rob Ford decided not to run for re-election as mayor after he was diagnosed with a malignant liposarcoma, a rare and aggressive cancer.

The cancer, doctors said, spread from the fatty tissue of Ford's abdomen to other parts of his body.

He tapped his campaign manager and brother, Doug, to run for mayor in his place.

On Monday night, Rob Ford won the Ward 2 city council seat, with 58.9% of the votes.

His brother lost the mayoral race to John Tory.

Fall from grace

Rob Ford's fall from grace, if you can call it that, began in May 2013 with the release of a cell phone video that appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine. The Toronto city council largely stripped him of his mayoral powers months later over those and other allegations of bad behavior.

Ford didn't back down, though, instead vowing "outright war" on the city council.

The mayor apologized for "a lot of stupid things," including having used crack cocaine, but he refused to resign or enter rehab.

In fact, despite all the criticism and his becoming a punchline for jokes in Canada as well as the United States, Ford launched a bid for re-election.

This past spring, after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly showed him smoking crack cocaine, Ford relented on one front: by going into rehab.

He returned to work in late June after a two-month rehab stint, saying he was "ashamed, embarrassed and humiliated" by some of his past actions.

But he refused to resign or refrain from campaigning, saying to the voters of Toronto, "I look forward to serving you for many, many more years."

Ford's term officially ends December 1.
