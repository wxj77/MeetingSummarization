(PEOPLE.com) -- It's another "Bachelor" break-up: Vienna Girardi and Kasey Kahl have called it quits.

"Yes vienna and I have split. It's been 5 weeks now. I can't fake it anymore. I will always love, be there for her, and wish her the best," Kahl, 27, posted to Twitter on Sunday.

"@KaseyRKahl will always be my best friend, but yes we have split. No idea what the future holds for us but we will always remain friends," Girardi, 25, posted to her account.

Girardi won Jake Pavelka's season of "The Bachelor" but the engagement didn't last long and the couple split in an ugly and highly publicized break-up.

Kahl wooed Ali Fedotowsky on "The Bachelorette" with song, and his catch phrase, "guard and protect your heart," ended up tattooed on his wrist. Fedotowsky was unimpressed.

Girardi and Kahl didn't give up on love or on reality TV. On "Bachelor Pad," Kahl and Girardi quickly became the power couple to beat, though they lost the competition to on-again-off-again couple Holly Durst and Michael Stagliano in the show's finale.
