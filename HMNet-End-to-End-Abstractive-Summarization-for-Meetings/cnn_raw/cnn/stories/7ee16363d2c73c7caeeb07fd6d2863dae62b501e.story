(CNN) -- Leading Women has won the silver award in the Social Media category at the inaugural WAN-IFRA European Digital Media Awards last Monday night.

The judges commended the "impressive initiative that only a global news organization like CNN could do" and praised the "comprehensive use of social media," saying it was "very ambitious and very well done."

It was also described as a great cross-media initiative -- that breathes engagement and interactivity.

Leading Women's digital coverage has strongly pursued social media stories over the last year.

In September, CNN co-hosted a live twitter chat alongside women's business groups Young Female Entrepreneurs and Women Grow Business with special guest Hanna Rosin, author of "The End of Men And The Rise of Women". With women in business flocking to Twitter to get real-time advice and counsel, the chat focused on how women are changing the world of work.
