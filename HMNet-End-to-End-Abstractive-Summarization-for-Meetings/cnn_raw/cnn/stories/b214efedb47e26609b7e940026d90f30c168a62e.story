(CNN) -- The body of Mary Kennedy, the estranged wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was moved to "a sunny hillside" in a separate section of the Cape Cod, Massachusetts, cemetery where she was originally interred two months ago, her family said.

Kennedy, who had been battling depression, was found dead May 16 in Bedford, New York, a small town north of New York City where she lived.

The medical examiner's office determined Kennedy died as a result of asphyxiation due to hanging. She was 52.

The decision to move her grave in St. Francis Xavier Cemetery was made because the original plot was closely surrounded by other graves with no room for expansion, Kennedy family spokesman Ken Sunshine said.

"The grave is now on a sunny hillside, shaded by an oak tree in an area with room for her children and other family," Sunshine said.

Kerry Kennedy, Mary's best friend and sister-in-law, and two of Mary's children selected the new gravesite last week, he said.

Kennedy family members have since purchased some 50 plots surrounding the grave, including plots reserved for all six of Mary and Robert Kennedy Jr.'s children, he said.
