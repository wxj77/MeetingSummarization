(CNN) -- A double from Bundesliga top scorer Mario Gomez saw Bayern Munich win 2-1 at 10-man Stuttgart on Sunday to open up a three-point lead at the top of the German table.

Stuttgart took a sixth minute lead when Christian Gentner's superb volley gave Manuel Neuer no chance in the Bayern goal.

But the home side were ahead for just seven minutes, with Bayern equalizing when Gomez found the net from a tight angle after Rafinha had crossed the ball in from the right.

Gladbach defeat leaves Bayern on top

Stuttgart's hopes of victory were dealt a huge blow when defender Cristian Molinaro earned two yellow cards in just five first half minutes, the second for a challenge on Arjen Robben.

And the visitors made their man advantage count 12 minutes after the break when Gomez rifled home Philipp Lahm's pass for his 15th league goal of the season.

Bayern lie on 34 points from their 16 games, three clear of Borussia Dortmund and Schalke at the top of the table.

Champions Dortmund lost ground when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Kaiserslautern in Sunday's other match.

Japanese winger Shinji Kagawa had given Dortmund a first half lead but the visitors leveled on the hour mark with a stunning volley from Olcay Sahan.

Borussia Moenchengladbach are a further point behind in fourth place after their shock 1-0 defeat at Augsburg on Saturday, while Werder Bremen remain in touch a further point behind after thumping Wolfsburg 4-1 on Saturday.
