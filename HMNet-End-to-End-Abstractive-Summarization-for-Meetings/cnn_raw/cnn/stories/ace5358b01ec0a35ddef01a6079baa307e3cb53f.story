(CNN) -- World number one Caroline Wozniacki has crashed out of the Madrid Masters, beaten by Germany's Julia Gorges for the second time in just over a week.

Gorges, ranked 27th in the world, stunned Wozniacki by defeating the Dane in the final of the Stuttgart clay-court event 11 days ago.

And the 22-year-old showed that result was no fluke with an impressive 6-4 1-6 6-3 third round success in the French capital.

"I'm quite proud of the last three weeks, I was able to play more aggressively today and I didn't give her any rhythm," Gorges told reporters after the match.

"I've been working hard on my fitness over the last 18 months and I think it's starting to show results."

Gorges will now face Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the last eight, after the Russian caused another shock with a 7-6 6-3 win over Australian fifth seed Samantha Stosur.

Meanwhile, fourth seed Victoria Azarenka continued her impressive run of form with a comfortable 6-0 6-3 win over Spain's Arantxa Parra Santonja.

The Belarussian took just over an hour to reach the quarterfinals and has dropped just five games in the tournament so far.

Azarenka is now the highest seed left in the tournament after French Open champion and third seed Francesca Schiavone of Italy was beaten 7-6 6-3 by American Bethanie Mattek-Sands.

There were no such problems for sixth seed Li Na of China, but she had to come from behind to beat Barcelona Open winner Roberta Vinci 2-6 6-2 6-1.
