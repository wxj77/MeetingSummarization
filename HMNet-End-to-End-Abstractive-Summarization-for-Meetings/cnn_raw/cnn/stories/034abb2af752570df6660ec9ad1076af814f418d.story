(CNN) -- A NEW OIL REALITY

Over three years of high oil prices have led to a boom time for the region's oil exporters, but recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration could change that. According the EIA U.S. oil imports are set to fall and crude output is set to grow. Any increase in U.S. output will likely send crude prices lower and as MME found out could mean a drastic change in energy policy for the region.

TONY HAYWARD, CEO, GENEL ENERGY

As the region's oil exporters react to a possible oil bonanza in the United States, MME talks face to face with Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP and CEO of independent energy company Genel Energy. From a booming business in Iraq to the lessons he learned from his time at BP, Tony Hayward talks to MME about the future of the energy sector.
