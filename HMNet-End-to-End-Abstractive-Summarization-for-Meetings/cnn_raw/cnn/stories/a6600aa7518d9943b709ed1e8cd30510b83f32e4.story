(CNN) -- Russian authorities detained 140 people -- more than 30 of them foreign nationals -- on Friday in a raid targeting suspected members of Islamic extremist groups, state media reported.

The operation was conducted at a place of worship in Dar Ul-Arkam in southern Moscow, state-run RIA Novosti reported, citing information from law enforcement agencies.

Members of Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, carried out the raid along with police. Russia Today, a state-funded television network, said the FSB issued a statement about the raid.

This site has been visited in the past by suspected radicals -- some from the North Caucasus region, which includes Chechnya -- the RIA Novosti report said.
