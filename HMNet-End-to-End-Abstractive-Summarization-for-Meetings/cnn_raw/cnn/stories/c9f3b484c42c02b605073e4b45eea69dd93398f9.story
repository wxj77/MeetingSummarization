(CNN) -- Bo Van Pelt edged out Jason Dufner to win an all-American battle at the Perth International Sunday and claim his first victory of the season.

The pair had dominated the latter stages of European Tour event with Van Pelt keeping his nerve to record a final round 68 for 16-under 272.

Dufner, playing his first event since being on the losing United States team at the Ryder Cup, had started the last round at Lake Karrinyup one shot adrift of his compatriot, but closed with a 69 for 274.

Van Pelt showed signs of nerves by missing short putts on the 14th and 17th but had sufficient buffer to protect his advantage.

"Jason and I had a great battle and played well," Van Pelt told the official European Tour website.

"It definitely got tight there at the end but luckily for me I came out on top.

"I have a lot of respect for Jason and his game -- he's a world class player and I knew it was going to be tough today," he added.

World No.10 Dufner was pleased with his efforts in Australia.

"It's been a good trip," he said. "It's good to get back out and compete and nice to be in the hunt after a couple weeks off and after the Ryder Cup. Nothing to be ashamed of, just got to tighten up a couple things."

Spaniard Alejandro Canizares shot 68 in the final round to come through to take third on 11 under, with

New Zealand's Michael Hendry in fourth on nine under.

England's Paul Casey had his first top-10 finish of the year on the European Tour as he tied for fifth with four other players.

They included halfway leader Emiliano Grillo of Argentina, who faded to a three-over 74 on the last day.

Van Pelt picked up a check for $333,000 for his victory in the richest tournament in Australia.
