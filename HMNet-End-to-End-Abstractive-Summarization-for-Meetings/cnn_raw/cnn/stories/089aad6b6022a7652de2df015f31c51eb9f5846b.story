(CNN Student News) -- April 7, 2014

Elections in Afghanistan and India headline our Monday edition of CNN Student News. We also report on a possible new lead in the search for a missing passenger plane, and we cover the costs of such a tremendous search effort. And in the month of the Bard's 450th birthday, we show you how a version of King Lear is helping a group of Syrian refugees.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.
