(EW.com) -- NBC is going to the White House for laughs this fall.

The broadcaster has given the family sitcom pilot "1600 Penn" a series order for 13 episodes. The project is created by "Book of Mormon" star Josh Gad, former Obama speechwriter Jon Lovett and "Modern Family" director Jason Winer.

Bill Pullman ("Independence Day") stars as the POTUS (again!) and Jenna Elfman ("Dharma & Greg") is the First Lady and stepmother to the president's children. Gad also co-stars as the president's out-of-control oldest son.

NBC's new comedy might benefit from the increased interest in politics thanks to the presidential election. The network had years of success with its White House-set drama "The West Wing."

The order follows several NBC series pickups for fall that have broken recently as the broadcast networks prepare for their upfront presentations to advertisers next week. The network has greenlit a Matthew Perry comedy, "Go On," about a charming sportscaster who attends therapy after a personal tragedy, J.J. Abrams' apocalyptic drama project "Revolution," "Glee" creator Ryan Murphy's gay family comedy "The New Normal" and an Anne Heche comedy called "Save Me."

UPDATE: The network also just picked up a comedy, "Animal Practice" (previously titled "Animal Kingdom"), which is "centered on a 'House'-like veterinarian, who loves animals but usually hates their owners." Justin Kirk and Tyler Labine star.
