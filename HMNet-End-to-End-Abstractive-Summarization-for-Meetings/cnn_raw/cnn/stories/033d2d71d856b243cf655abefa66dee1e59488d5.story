Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The younger son of political activist Aung San Suu Kyi left Myanmar Tuesday after a long-awaited visit with his mother, from whom he'd been separated for a decade.

Kim Aris was seen arriving back in Bangkok, Thailand, later in the day.

Aris had been in Myanmar for a little more than two weeks visiting with his mother.

He last saw his Nobel Peace Laureate mother in 2000, when he spent about two weeks with her, according to one of her attorneys.

Suu Kyi was released from house arrest on November 13, after spending most of the past 20 years under house arrest or in prison.

Suu Kyi release came after national elections in Myanmar.

Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party boycotted the November 7 elections, faulting the country's ruling military junta.

Before the election, the regime had enacted a new law that forced the Suu Kyi's party to choose between honoring her as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal, or ejecting Suu Kyi from the party and contesting the elections.

Generals in Myanmar refused to allow international monitors to oversee the elections and overhauled Myanmar's constitution in a way critics say is aimed at tightening the regime's grip.

The constitution now requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since 1962.
