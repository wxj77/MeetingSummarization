New York (CNN) -- At least a dozen employees of the New York Police Department were reprimanded following an investigation into comments deemed racist that were posted online about the city's West Indian Day Parade, the NYPD reported Thursday.

The comments were posted on a Facebook group page last year called "No More West Indian Detail," which has since been removed.

The page was used by those protesting NYPD security at the West Indian Day Parade to vent their frustrations.

The parade is an annual event in Brooklyn that celebrates West Indian history and culture, but has been a scene of violence in recent years.

Some posts referred to the event as "the unemployment parade," likening marchers to "animals."

The NYPD has not identified which posts of the hundred-plus comments were made by its employees.

Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly started an investigation into the comments in December 2011.

Last year, two NYPD officers were injured by gunfire near the parade, while marchers accused police of using excessive force.
