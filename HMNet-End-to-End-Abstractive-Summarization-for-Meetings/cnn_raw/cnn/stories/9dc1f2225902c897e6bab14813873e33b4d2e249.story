(InStyle.com) -- With the Grammy Awards coming up this weekend, most will be buzzing about not only Kanye West and Adele, but also what the nominees and artists will be wearing.

See some of the most unbelievable outfits from music's biggest stars.

Rihanna, 2011

Sultry Rihanna played peek-a-boo in a frilled illusion gown from Jean Paul Gaultier. "He's one of my favorite designers," she said. "I pretty much snatched [the dress] off the runway."

Katy Perry, 2011

An angelic looking Katy Perry called her Giorgio Armani Prive ensemble "classic, but with a theatrical edge." The look paired a Swarovski crystal-encrusted bustier with an iridescent ruffled skirt and feather wings.

Toni Braxton, 2001

Toni Braxton wore Richard Tyler (and lots of double-stick tape) to pick up her Best Female R&B Vocal Performance trophy. "I've always gone a little risque with all my other awards [show outfits]," she told People. "I decided that before I got married and had babies, I'd wear this."

Mary J. Blige, 1996

Who's that mystery woman? A shades-wearing Mary J. Blige picked up her first Grammy for the Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in head-to-toe leopard print. The covered-up look included a hood and gloves.

Christina Aguilera, 2001

Christina Aguilera showed some skin in a Trish Summerville gown with a lace-up neckline (and matching bra). Aside from her major braids, the double nominee made a beauty statement with a dress-matching temporary rose tattoo on her lower back.

Missy Elliott, 2000

Talk about razor-sharp tailoring! Missy Elliott opted for a purple Versace two-piece covered in blades.

Sheryl Crow, 2002

Erykah Badu, 2002

"The most rock and roll accessory I have on tonight is my headband," Erykah Badu told InStyle. "It's made of copper leather, which I cut myself." Her avant-garde ensemble also included a draped dress with a leather sash, silver moonboots and waist-length green extensions.
