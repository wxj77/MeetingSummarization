(CNN) -- One of the joys of watching FIFA's quadrennial football fest is seeing relative unknowns -- young prospects or previously unheralded players -- come to the fore with some dazzling football.

Here are 11 players who have made their mark in Brazil (or the run-up to the World Cup), and who will leave the country with some of the world's biggest clubs salivating over the prospect of adding these stars of the future to their rosters.

Perhaps by 2018, in Russia, these 11 will be household names -- but by then the fun of recognizing the new crop of talented stars will have begun all over again.

Who do you think should be included? Tell us in the comments below.
