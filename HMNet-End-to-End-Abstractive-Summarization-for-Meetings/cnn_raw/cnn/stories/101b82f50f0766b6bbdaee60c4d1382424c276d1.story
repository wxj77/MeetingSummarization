(Rolling Stone) -- Despite a flurry of Top 10 debuts, Eminem's "Recovery" sold another 116,000 copies to claim No. 1 for the seventh week, Billboard reports.

Recovery now has the most weeks at No. 1 for a hip-hop album since OutKast accrued seven with 2003's "Speakerboxx/The Love Below." (Eminem was bumped from the top spot for one week when Arcade Fire released "The Suburbs.")

Four new releases made it into this week's Top Five: Kem's "Intimacy" took No. 2 with 74,000 copies, while Ray LaMontagne's "God Willin' & The Creek Don't Rise" entered at No. 3 with 64,000 copies -- 49,000 of which came from digital sales, which were aided by a $3.99 Amazon MP3 Store promotion.

After topping this week's U.K. album charts, Iron Maiden scored their best-ever chart performance as "The Final Frontier" came in at No. 4, improving on the band's only other Top 10 U.S. debut, 2006's "A Matter of Life and Death," which scored No. 9. Trace Adkins' "Cowboy's Back in Town" rounded out the Top Five, and John Mellencamp's "No Better Than This" entered at No. 10.

Eminem did finally relinquish the top spot on the digital songs chart as "Love the Way You Lie" with Rihanna fell to Lil Wayne, who nabbed his first-ever No. 1 digital song with "Right Above It," which was downloaded 225,000 times last week. Album sales were up 2 percent compared to last week, which was the lowest selling week of the SoundScan era.
