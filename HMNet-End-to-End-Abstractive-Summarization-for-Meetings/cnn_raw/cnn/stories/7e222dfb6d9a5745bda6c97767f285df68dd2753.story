(CNNGo) -- OK, you've decided Valentine's Day is the day to pop the big question. You cheesemeister.

But picking February 14 means you're going to have to do it in spectacular fashion. And in a place in which she'll be so overcome by images of butterflies, rose petals and couples sprinting toward each other in meadows that a "No" is simply not a possibility.

These are the sweetest places to begin the rest of your life.

10. Petra, Jordan

A poet once described Petra as "a rose-red city half as old as time."

Make this a metaphor for your own enduring romance by popping the question while this city carved into rock faces more than 2,000 years ago is lit up by rows of flickering candles.

To see Petra at its most beautiful, join a Petra by Night tour that takes visitors through the city via its most famous landmarks.

After making your way through the dramatic Siq fissure and coming face to face with the facade of the Treasury, sit on the sand and listen to local Bedouin making music from within the façade's entry.

It's the perfect moment to quietly slip the ring onto your sweetheart's finger.

What you need to know: Tours start at 8:30 p.m. every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday and last for 90 minutes. Tickets can be bought at the Petra Site Office. Visit the Jordan Tourism Board website for more details.

With the rolling English countryside in the background, and log-burning stoves roaring indoors, it's the perfect setting for your own epic romance.

North Lees Hall is located in the Peak District National Park, where you can go hang-gliding, horseback riding, caving and climbing once you've tired of indoor activity.
