German software maker SAP's boss says the company is not preparing for a "Grexit" because it expects the crisis-hit eurozone to hold itself together.

Co-chief executive Jim Hagemann Snabe told CNN he did not expect Greece to exit the common currency -- a scenario which has been dubbed the "Grexit." He said: "I see there is a strong political will to solve the situation around the euro."

Greece is a "special situation," Snabe said. He added: "We don't have a large portion of our revenue in Greece... I think the Greek situation can be isolated."

Snabe said SAP -- one of the biggest makers of business software in the world -- is well-placed despite the ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone.

He said: "We've seen double-digit growth for 11 quarters because we have the software that helps companies maneuver in this economic environment."

However, Snabe added, "no company is immune to the eurozone crisis."
