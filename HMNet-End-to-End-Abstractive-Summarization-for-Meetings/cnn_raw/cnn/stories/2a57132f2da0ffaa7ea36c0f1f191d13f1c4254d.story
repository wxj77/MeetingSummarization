(CNN) -- Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin responded angrily on her Facebook page Friday to a verbal attack by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka where he called her a "crazy magnet."

"I'm not sure why he's attacking my record when I'm not the one responsible for  the policies resulting in continued mass unemployment and a weak economy," Palin shot back. "Among my 'crimes,' the union boss cited the fact that I sometimes write notes on  my hand (guilty as charged!); that I appear on cable television every once in a  while to comment on the news (it's called the First Amendment, Rich); and that  my common sense conservatism makes him laugh."

Trumka released the text of the speech before he gave it on Thursday at his organization's convention in Alaska. In it he complains that every time Democrats have proposed jobs legislation they have been blocked by "the most politically motivated Republican minority we have ever seen -- and I really do mean ever...

Then he asks, "What is this crazy magnet that's pulling people to the right? I mean, look at your former governor..."

"After she tied herself to John McCain and they lost, she blew off  Alaska," he said. "I guess she figured she'd trade up -- shoot for a national stage.  Alaska was too far from the FOX TV spotlight. I bet  most of you, on a clear day, can see her hypocrisy from your house."

Palin provided her own assessment of Trumka on her Facebook response.

"Trumka's attempts to put himself on the side of the working man and woman would  be more convincing if he weren't a career union boss who's spent most of his  life in DC," the statement on Palin's Facebook page said.  "No surprise then that his priorities aren't the priorities of the  average working man or woman, but of the Beltway power player."
