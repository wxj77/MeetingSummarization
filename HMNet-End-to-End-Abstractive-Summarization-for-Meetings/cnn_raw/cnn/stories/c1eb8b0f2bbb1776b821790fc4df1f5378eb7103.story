(EW.com) -- Bummer news from the king of the "Bachelor" franchise today.

Mike Fleiss answered a fan inquiry on Twitter by saying there won't be a fourth edition of "Bachelor Pad," the cheesy fun spinoff of "The Bachelor" this summer.

ABC confirmed that "Pad," which has been a solid little player for ABC in the summer months, will not return this year.

No word yet on whether we will ever see the "Pad" again.
