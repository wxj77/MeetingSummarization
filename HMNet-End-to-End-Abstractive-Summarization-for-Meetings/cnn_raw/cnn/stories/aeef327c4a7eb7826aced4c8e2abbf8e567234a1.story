(CNN Student News) -- February 26, 2014

From a report in the Venezuelan capital, CNN Student News brings you two very different views of the country's government. We also look at the pros and cons of a U.S. government proposal regarding food ads in schools, and we examine how a 12-year-old's invention with LEGOs could change the world.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.
