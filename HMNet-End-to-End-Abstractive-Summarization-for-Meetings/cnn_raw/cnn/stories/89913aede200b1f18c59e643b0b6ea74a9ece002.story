(CNN) -- Ten years after 113 people died when a Concorde jet crashed into a hotel outside Paris, local officials say the country's government has not done enough to protect people living near the airport.

"Seventy-five percent of air accidents have happened in taking off or landing in densely populated areas," Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy said in a statement.

The town of Gonesse, located north of Paris, was scheduled to hold a memorial service Sunday to honor the 113 victims who died when the Concorde jet crashed there on July 25, 2000.

A court is expected to rule in a manslaughter case related to the crash in December, a statement from Gonesse's government said.

"Despite 10 years of investigation and four months of trial, all the responsibility does not seem to have been established," the statement said.

French investigators said a small titanium strip that was loose caused the crash. It had fallen from a Continental Airlines plane on the runway minutes earlier.

The crash, coupled with rising costs and a slump in demand, eventually led to Concorde's retirement in 2003.
