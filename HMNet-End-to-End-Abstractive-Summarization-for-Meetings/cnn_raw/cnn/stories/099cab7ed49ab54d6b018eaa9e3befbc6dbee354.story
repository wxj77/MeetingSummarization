(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton is confident the return of the kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) to McLaren cars for the 2011 Formula One season will give the team a big advantage over their rivals.

The system -- which stores up energy created when a car brakes to enhance the vehicle's acceleration -- was first used in the sport in 2009, and teams such McLaren and Ferrari used it to great effect.

The technology was banned in 2010 as a cost-cutting measure, however, the device will return to F1 next year after a more affordable solution was found and 2008 champion Hamilton believes McLaren's version is the finest on the grid.

"Our KERS is the best. It shud [should] deliver," the 25-year-old wrote on his Twitter blog Tuesday.

Hamilton's teammate and compatriot Jenson Button also hoped the energy-saving modification could help the team to get the better of Ferrari and 2010 constructors' title winners Red Bull.

"I've never driven with KERS before, but this team used KERS last year and used it well, I know because they kept coming by me at the start!" the former Brawn GP driver said during a McLaren web chat.

"They have so much experience in that area that I think we'll have an advantage - as will Mercedes and Force India, who use Mercedes engines.

"We'll have an advantage on Red Bull and Ferrari I think, which is great. We'll take every advantage we possibly can."

McLaren finished the season second in the constructors' standings, 44 points behind first-placed Red Bull with Ferrari in third place.

Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel won the championship with British pair Hamilton and Button in fourth and fifth places in the standings.

The 2011 season begins with Bahrain Grand Prix on March 13 and teams are already testing for the new campaign.
