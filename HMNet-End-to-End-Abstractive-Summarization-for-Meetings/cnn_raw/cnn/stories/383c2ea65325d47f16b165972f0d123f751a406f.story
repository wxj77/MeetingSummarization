(CNN) -- Ivory Coast's star-studded team beat Burkina Faso 2-0 Thursday to seal qualification to the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations.

Salomon Kalou put the Ivory Coast ahead in the first half and victory was sealed as Bakary Kone headed an own goal in the final minutes of the Group B clash in the Estado Neuvo de Malabo in Equatorial Guinea.

Ivory Coast beat Sudan 1-0 in their opening match and look set to qualify as group winners.

Earlier, Sudan and Angola shared four goals in their Group B match at the same stadium.

It leaves Angola in second place in the section and in a strong position to go through with Ivory Coast who they meet Monday.

Chelsea's Kalou thumped home his shot in the 16th minute after a cross by his club teammate Didier Drogba .

Burkina Faso pressed at the start of the second half, but it was Arsenal's Gervinho who had the best chance for the Ivory Coast from close range.

Kalou pulled up injured and was substituted before his side survived a real scare as Burkina Faso striker Moumouni Dagano outjumped Souleymane Bamba only to see his header hit the woodwork.

Kone's looping 82nd minute back header sealed his side's fate as it flew over his goalkeeper Daouda Diakite. With two defeats in two games they are going home.

In the earlier match, Sudan ended a 36-year Africa Cup of Nations goal drought, but they had to come from behind twice to draw with Angola.

Mohamed Bashir twice leveled for Sudan with former Manchester United striker Manucho grabbing Angola's goals.
