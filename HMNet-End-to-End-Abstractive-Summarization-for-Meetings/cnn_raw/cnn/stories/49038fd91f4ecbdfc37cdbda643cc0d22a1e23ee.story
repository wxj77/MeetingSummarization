(CNN) -- Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick walked out of prison a free man Tuesday after serving just over 14 months of a 5-year sentence at a state facility in Jackson, Michigan.

Kilpatrick had been serving time for violating probation related to a 2008 case against him.

The former mayor walked out of the prison and got into a waiting SUV early Tuesday. He was given "a small amount of cash from the cashier's office" upon his release, said John Cordell, spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections.

Kilpatrick was expected to board a flight to Dallas, where he was to be reunited with his family. He is to check in with a Texas parole officer on his arrival, and he must serve two years of parole, Cordell said.

The former mayor pleaded guilty in September 2008 to two felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from his efforts to cover up an extramarital affair. He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer who was attempting to serve a subpoena on a Kilpatrick friend in that case.

He then spent more than three months in jail before being released in February 2009 on five years of probation. He was also ordered to pay restitution as part of his original plea deal.

But on May 25, 2010, Wayne County Judge David Groner sentenced Kilpatrick to five years in prison for failing to report assets that could be used to pay the restitution, a violation of his probation.

Kilpatrick will be subject to usual restrictions for parolees, plus an order to pay back what his lawyer called $860,000 in restitution.

But even if he abides by all these conditions, the former mayor's troubles are not over. He also faces a host of federal charges related to his time as Detroit's chief executive, including racketeering, extortion, bribery and filing false tax returns.
