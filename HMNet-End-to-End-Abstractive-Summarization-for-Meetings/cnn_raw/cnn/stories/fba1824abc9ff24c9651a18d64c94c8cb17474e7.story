(CNN) -- North Korea said Sunday it would no longer move forward with nuclear disarmament in response to a planned U.S.-South Korean joint military exercise.

The announcement was made by the official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA.

"The maneuvers clearly indicate once again that the U.S. and the South Korean authorities are the harassers of peace and warmongers keen to bring a war to this land," the statement said.

North Korea also announced it would no longer abide by the armistice that brought a truce to the Korean War, saying that South Korea violated the agreement by participating in the military cooperation with the United States.

Disarmament talks were already at an impasse between North Korea, the United States and other nations. The military exercises would bring negotiations to a standstill and push North Korea to boost its nuclear arsenal, the statement said.

"The process for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will naturally come to a standstill and (North Korea) will bolster its nuclear deterrent for self-defense," the statement said.

All talks between North Korea, the United States and South Korea will be suspended if the joint exercises go through as planned, North Korea said.
