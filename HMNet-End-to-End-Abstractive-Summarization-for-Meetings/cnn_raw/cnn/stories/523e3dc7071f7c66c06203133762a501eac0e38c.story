London, England (CNN) -- The drone of the vuvuzela will not be heard in any European competitions after the continent's governing body banned them from all stadiums hosting UEFA matches.

The plastic trumpets that were used by fans at the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, will be banned from the Champions League and Europa League, as well as all Euro 2012 Qualifying matches.

"UEFA has decided that vuvuzelas may not be brought into stadiums at matches in UEFA competitions," a statement on the governing body's website said.

The organization believes the instrument is integral to the football culture of South Africa, and its use in Europe would be inappropriate.

"The World Cup was characterized by the vuvuzela's widespread and permanent use in the stands. In the specific context of South Africa, the vuvuzela adds a touch of local flavor and folklore," the statement read.

"UEFA feels that the instrument's widespread use would not be appropriate in Europe, where a continuous loud background noise would be emphasized.

"UEFA is of the view that the vuvuzelas would completely change the atmosphere, drowning supporter emotions and detracting from the experience of the game."

The plastic horns have divided opinion since July's competition in South Africa, with numerous English Premier League clubs banning them from their stadiums.

Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal were among the first clubs to issue a ban, citing irritation and safety concerns as their reasons.

West Ham have also banned the vuvuzela, stating the horns could be considered a weapon.
