(CNN) -- The crew of a Danish cargo ship that caught fire off the coast of Norway was trapped on board after a rescue attempt Saturday was halted because of bad weather, authorities said.

A helicopter airlift of some of the crew members aboard the Britannia Seaways was halted because of strong winds, said John Sjurso, a spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Center of Southern Norway.

The fire began Saturday in the steering room of the Britannia Seaways, which was in the North Sea en route from Oslo to Bergen, Sjurso said. The cause of the fire was not immediately known.

Crew members were fighting the fire, but it was not immediately known what equipment they had at their disposal to battle the flames, Sjurso said.

There were no immediate reports of injuries.

The Britannia Seaways, a three-deck cargo ship, is carrying 24,000 tons of military equipment and has a crew of 32. It is not immediately known how many of the crew were rescued before the airlift was stopped due to the storm.

Sjurso said late Saturday the ship is still running under its own power.
