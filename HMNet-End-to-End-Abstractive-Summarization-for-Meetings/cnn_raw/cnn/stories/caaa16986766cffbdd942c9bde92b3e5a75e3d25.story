LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A light earthquake shook Southern California Thursday evening, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.

The magnitude 4.5 quake struck at 7:50 p.m. (10:50 p.m. ET) and was centered in San Bernardino, about 55 miles east of Los Angeles. A smaller magnitude 3.3 aftershock hit about an hour later.

Although the quake was centered just a mile from San Bernadino's city hall, it was 10 miles below the surface, said Dr. Egill Hauksson, a seismologist with the Earthquake Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology.

"It's unlikely that there's going to be damage," said Hauksson said.

There are about 10 quakes of this strength every year in this area, he said.

Initial estimates put the quake at a magnitude 5.0, but it was downgraded shortly afterward.

The USGS said people reported feeling the earthquake as far away as San Diego.
