(EW.com) -- Rita Ora, best known as a singer signed to Jay Z's Roc Nation label, has been cast as Mia, Christian Grey's adopted sister, in "Fifty Shades of Grey."

The British pop star has only four IMDb credits to her name, so this will be a pretty high-profile introduction to her acting.

Dakota Johnson on 'Fifty Shades': I really understand it

Ora confirmed the news, first reported by The Hollywood Reporter, on Twitter:

"Fifty Shades of Grey," which just began shooting Monday and arrives in theaters in February 2015, stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.

The best-selling book-turned-potential film franchise also stars Max Martini (bodyguard Jason Taylor) and newcomer Eloise Mumford (roommate Kate Kavanaugh).

In the books, Mia is described as tall and curvaceous (Ora has that covered), but she's also said to have raven hair. Does Ora fit the bill in your mind?
