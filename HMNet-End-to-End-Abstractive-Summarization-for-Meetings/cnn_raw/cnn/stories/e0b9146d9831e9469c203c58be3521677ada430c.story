(CNN) -- Elizabeth Vargas has returned to rehab as part of her ongoing battle against alcohol addiction.

The 20/20 anchor released a statement saying that she made the decision while on vacation this past weekend to return to treatment.

"As so many other recovering alcoholics know, overcoming the disease can be a long and incredibly difficult process," Vargas said in her statement. "I feel I have let myself, my co-workers and most importantly my family down and for that I am ashamed and sorry."

In November 2013 Vargas revealed that she was struggling with alcohol dependence and first entered a treatment facility. A spokesperson for ABC, for whom Vargas also hosts news specials, released a statement in support of her.

"Nothing is more important than Elizabeth's health and well-being and we stand squarely behind her," the statement from ABC said. "Our thoughts are with Elizabeth and her family and we look forward to having her back at ABC News when she feels ready to return."

Vargas gave no indication as to how long she expects to be in treatment, but reiterated her determination to get sober.

"I am committed to battling and addressing this debilitating disease and want to thank everyone who has offered their unwavering support during this trying time," she said in her statement.
