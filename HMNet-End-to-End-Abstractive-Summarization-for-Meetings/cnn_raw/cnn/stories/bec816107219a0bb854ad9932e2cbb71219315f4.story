(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney's injury time header gave Manchester United a 3-1 victory over city rivals Manchester City to put them through to the English League Cup final 4-3 on aggregate.

City won last week's first leg 2-1, courtesy of a double by former United striker Carlos Tevez, but the English champions brought the aggregate scores level early in the second half.

Rooney sent Ryan Giggs racing clear with a superb cross-field pass. City's defence appeared to have halted the attack, but the ball eventually fell to Michael Carrick, whose pass found veteran midfielder Paul Scholes to fire past goalkeeper Shay Given.

Then, with 20 minutes remaining, the tie looked settled when  Darren Fletcher laid a Nani pass into the path of Carrick who scored with a precision side-footed effort into the corner of the City goal.

Tevez was jeered by the home fans, but the Argentine again showed what the Old Trafford club are missing when pulling a goal back five minutes later, flicking Craig Bellamy's cross powerfully home, ahead of defender Rio Ferdinand, to leave the tie poised for extra time.

However, in the 91st minute, England forward Rooney -- who scored all four goals in United's victory over Hull on Saturday -- struck with a close range header from a Giggs to deny City a place in their first major final for 29 years.

United will now face Aston Villa in a repeat of the 1994 League Cup final, looking to gain revenge for that particular 3-1 Wembley defeat.
