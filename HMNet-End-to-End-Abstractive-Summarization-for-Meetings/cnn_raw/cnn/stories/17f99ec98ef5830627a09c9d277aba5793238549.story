(CNN) -- She may be a fully-fledged pop star with a growing global appeal but Nigerian singer, Asa, is determined to remain true to her African roots.

The 29 year old artist initially found fame on her home continent thanks to her soulful musical melodies, which have since proved popular with audiences in Europe and beyond.

She has since opened live shows for the musical superstars such as Beyonce, Snoop Dogg, Akon and John Legend.

But despite sampling the sweet taste of global recognition, it is Nigeria and Africa that remain the singer's main sources of inspiration.

"I'm proud to be Nigerian and I also hope other Nigerians feel proud that they have a great country, she adds"

"People have preconceptions of Nigeria ... so for other Nigerians we need to know that we cannot hide, we need to defend, and how do we defend, we need to be good at whatever we do," she adds.

Asa is just the latest in a long line of African artists to make it big on the world stage.
