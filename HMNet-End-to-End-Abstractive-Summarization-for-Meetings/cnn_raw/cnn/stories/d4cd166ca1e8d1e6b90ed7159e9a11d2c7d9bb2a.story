(CNN) -- Finnish authorities arrested a man Friday after he fired six shots through a school classroom door and shot an office worker in the hand in two separate incidents, police said.

No one was injured in the school shooting, police said.

The man first entered an office building in the Tampere area, in southern Finland, and shot a man in one hand with a hunting rifle, a police spokesman said. The injuries are not life-threatening.

He then went into the school, where he fired through the door of a classroom, the spokesman said.

Police arrested the man at the scene and took him to the Tampere police station, where he is being questioned.

The man is believed to hold a permit for three guns, but police cannot confirm whether one of those three guns was used in the attacks, the spokesman said.

Police are interviewing witnesses, the spokesman said.
