(CNN) -- Claudio Ranieri paid the price for Greece's humiliating defeat to the Faroe Islands when it was confirmed Saturday that he had been sacked as national team coach.

The 63-year-old Italian's fate was sealed after the 1-0 loss in Athens, which left the former European champion bottom of its Euro 2016 qualifying group with a single point from four games.

Ranieri had only been in charge since July, taking over from Portugal's Fernando Santos, who had led the Greeks to the last 16 of the World Cup in Brazil.

But results since have been poor and an opening defeat to Group F leaders Romania set the scene for Ranieri's eventual departure.

A statement on the official website of the Greek National Football Federation said Ranieri and his coaching staff had been relieved of their duties.

The writing on the wall was clear for all to see in the immediate aftermath of Friday's defeat with federation president Giorgos Sarris openly admitting that Ranieri's appointment had been a mistake.

"Following today's devastating result for the national team, I take full responsibility for the unfortunate choice of coach," he said in a statement on the official website.

No replacement has been named, but Greece is due to meet Serbia on Tuesday, a team also without a coach after Dick Advocaat stepped down after a 3-1 home defeat to Denmark in Group I Friday.

Ranieri took full responsibility after the defeat but said he would not resign.

"This defeat was a surprise for me and my players. It was very painful. A very bad result," he told gathered reporters.

Ranieri had previously managed big-spending Monaco -- taking them to second in the French Ligue 1 in 2013.

He has also been in charge of English Premier League Chelsea and a trio of Serie A clubs Inter Milan, Napoli and Roma.
