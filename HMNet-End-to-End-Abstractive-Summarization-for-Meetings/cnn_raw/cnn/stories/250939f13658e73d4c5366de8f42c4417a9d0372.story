Los Angeles (CNN) -- Hip-hop artist Soulja Boy faces a felony weapons charge after police say he was carrying a loaded gun in Los Angeles Wednesday.

The 23-year-old rapper, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, was arrested after a Los Angeles police officer pulled over a car in which he was a passenger, police spokeswoman Rosario Herrera told CNN.

Soulja Boy was booked into a San Fernando Valley jail, but freed after posting a $35,000 bond Wednesday afternoon, according to jail records.

The traffic stop happened on a residential street in the Granada Hills area of the San Fernando Valley at 4 a.m., Herrera said.

He was arrested on felony weapons and drug charges during a traffic stop on a Georgia interstate in October 2011. Police said they found a "felony amount" of marijuana and firearms in his rented SUV.

The local district attorney in Carroll County, Georgia, declined to prosecute the case because federal prosecutors took it over, according to a spokesman for the district attorney.

The U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta did not immediately respond to a CNN question about the status of the case.
