(CNN) -- A rain-triggered landslide killed at least two people and toppled 11 buildings Wednesday in southwest China, state-run media said, citing local authorities.

The disaster occurred in Sichuan province's Dujiangyan city, fire officials said, according to the Xinhua news agency.

Twenty-one people still were missing after the landslide, authorities in Dujiangyan said Thursday morning, adding that they are "fully committed" to rescue efforts.

About 370,000 people and more than 81,000 acres of crops have been affected by the flooding, which has plagued the mountainous region since Monday. It has resulted in more than $40 million in direct economic losses, provincial officials said.

Zhang Jiuchun is an interior designer living in Mianyang, the second-largest city in Sichuan. He told CNN in a phone interview that continuing flooding, along with landslides and mudslides, has paralyzed highway and rail services in many parts of the province.

Zhang said suburban areas are seeing the most severe impacts.

"I think it's the worst since 1998," Zhang said of the disaster, referring to major flooding sweeping across China over a decade ago.

Xinhua also reported that 352 stranded tourists have been securely moved out of Dujiangyan.
