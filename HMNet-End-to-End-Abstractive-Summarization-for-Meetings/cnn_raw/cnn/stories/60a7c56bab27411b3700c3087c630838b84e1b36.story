(CNN) -- Caroline Wozniacki claimed her first title of the season on Sunday with a straight-sets win over Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova at the WTA Dubai Tennis Championships.

Denmark's Wozniacki -- who will leapfrog Australian Open champion Kim Clijsters to become world No. 1 for a second time on Monday -- took just 75 minutes to dismiss double grand slam winner Kuznetsova 6-1 6-3.

The 20-year-old broke her 23rd-ranked opponent's serve in the second game to take a 2-0 lead, and went on to break twice more to seal a one-sided first set in just over 30 minutes.

Former world No. 4 Kuznetsova threatened a comeback as top-seeded Wozniacki served for the match at 5-2 but it was too little too late for the one-time U.S. and French Open champion.

Wozniacki briefly lost the number one ranking, which she had held since October 2010, after losing in the last four of the Australian Open in January.

However, the 2009 U.S. Open runner-up said that she believes her triumph in the United Arab Emirates, where she did not drop a set all week, can spur her on to greater things this year.

"It's great to have this as my first tournament back and to see me smiling again," she told reporters after winning her 13th title on the women's tour.

"I knew that if I just keep working hard, and I take my chances, my time will come. And I'm back here playing well."

Elsewhere in France, world No. 4 and double French Open finalist Robin Soderling came from a set down against Croatia's Marin Cilic to win the ATP Marseille Open to continue his impressive start to the season.

The Swedish world no. 4, who won in Rotterdam last week and also took the Brisbane crown in January, battled to a 6-7(8) 6-3 6-3 victory over the former world No. 9 to claim his ninth singles title.
