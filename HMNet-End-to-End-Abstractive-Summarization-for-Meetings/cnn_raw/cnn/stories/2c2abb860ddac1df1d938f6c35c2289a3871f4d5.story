(CNN) -- Two American hikers detained in Iran for years will meet State Department officials in Washington on Thursday, less than a month after they arrived back home on American soil.

Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Deputy Secretary William Burns. Sarah Shourd, who was jailed with them but freed last year, will also join them.

The details of the meeting are unclear, but the two men acknowledged State Department officials in their first public statement when they arrived home in the United States last month.

"There were also U.S. government officials who worked for our release, and some of them found creative ways to try and lessen the tension between the U.S. and Iran. Consular officials at the State Department supported our families throughout," Bauer said.

After their release, Clinton issued a statement "welcoming the decision made by Iranian authorities" to free the two men.

"After more than two years, they will finally be reunited with their friends and families. I am grateful for the efforts of all those who have worked for their release," Clinton said.

Fattal, Bauer and Shourd were arrested after straying across the unmarked border between Iraqi Kurdistan and Iran in July 2009.

Shourd, Bauer's fiancee, was released in 2010, but Bauer and Fattal were freed a year later, after 781 days in captivity and a trial for espionage that Bauer said was based on "ridiculous lies."
