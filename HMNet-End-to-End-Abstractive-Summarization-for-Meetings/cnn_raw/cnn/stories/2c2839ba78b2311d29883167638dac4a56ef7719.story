(EW.com ) -- Man, this was really a no-win situation.

Ice Cube apologized on Twitter to Paul Walker fans/the world after he expressed his disappointment over losing the Best Screen Duo award at the MTV Movie Awards to Vin Diesel and the late Paul Walker for "Fast & Furious 6." Pro tip: Don't complain about losing an MTV award to a man who died recently. (Second of all: Maybe don't complain about losing an MTV award at all?)

Sunday he told USA Today, "We was robbed. Shame on you MTV." Now he's having second thoughts about how that sounded. Read Ice Cube's Twitter stream from Monday night below:
