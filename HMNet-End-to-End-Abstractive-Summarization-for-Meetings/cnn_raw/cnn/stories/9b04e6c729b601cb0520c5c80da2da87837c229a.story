(AOL Autos) -- Consumer Reports recently announced its annual used cars ratings, and we weren't surprised to see one of the major categories was "Best in Fuel Economy."

With gasoline and oil prices on a seemingly endless upward spiral, that's a key factor these days when choosing a used car -- or even a new one.

The cars that made this list were, according to Consumer Reports, "the affordable and reliable vehicles [that] returned some of the best results in our real-world fuel-economy tests."

What follows is a list of the vehicles that magazine rated "Best in Fuel Economy" in the under $10,000 price range, with a short description of each vehicle. The mileage figures stated are the ones calculated by Consumer Reports in their own on-the-road tests.

2000 Honda Insight  Overall MPG: 51

When the Insight hit showrooms in 1999 for the 2000 model year, it was hailed as one of the cleanest and most fuel-efficient vehicles in the world. It was the first gasoline-electric hybrid to be sold in the U.S., and won several design, engineering and technology awards.

The Insight employs Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system, combining an extremely lightweight 1.0-liter, three-cylinder gasoline automobile engine with an ultra-thin electric motor. Early models came with a 5-speed manual transmission, but a continuously variable transmission (CVT) was offered starting in '01.

2001 - 2002 Toyota Prius  Overall MPG: 41

This was one of the earliest generations of the fuel-sipping Prius, and it certainly has become a green living icon since then. Drawing its power from a combination of a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine and an electric motor, these earlier editions generated only 70 hp, but muscle isn't the point in a hybrid car. It's pod-like design had a certain retro-futuristic appeal, and was roomier than one might think.

2000 - 2005 Toyota Echo  Overall MPG: 38

The Echo was rolled out in 2000 as a no-frills compact econo-box, for those who wanted Toyota quality but were on a budget that precluded them from snagging a Corolla.

The interior is plain, but the engine is reliable and efficient, and the taut suspension delivers a ride comparable to larger models. This version of the Echo comes with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder 108-hp 16-Valve EFI engine.

1998 - 2002 Chevrolet Prizm  Overall MPG: 32

The Prizm of this era bore some resemblance to the Corolla, since both were built on the same assembly line in a joint GM/Toyota plant. A front-wheel-drive subcompact sedan, the Prizm was initially rolled out under the Geo nameplate, but later became a Chevy model.

Available as a base model and LSi, the Prizm is powered by single twin-cam four-cylinder engines that produced 120 hp in 1998 and 1999, but the addition of VVT in 2000 boosted the ponies to 125.

1998 Mazda Protégé LX  Overall MPG: 32

Mazda redesigned the Protégé in 1995, upgrading it considerably with a more rigid chassis and much-improved ride quality -- not to mention increased interior space.

This edition also offers a silkier ride, crisp handling and solid performance for a small car. This model year has a 92-hp 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, and comes in three trim levels.

1998 - 2000 Toyota Corolla CE/LE  Overall MPG: 32/31

The Corolla has been a stalwart for more than 40 years, for its quality, dependability and, maybe most importantly, for its fuel economy. The 1998-1999 editions are powered by a 1.8 L, 120-hp, four-cylinder 16-Valve EFI, with aluminum alloy block and head.

By 2000, they'd tweaked the engine to deliver 125 ponies. A front-wheel drive job, the Corollas of this period come in three trim levels, but Consumer Reports chose the midline CE and top-end LE.

1998 - 2001 Acura Integra LS  Overall MPG: 32

The Acura Integra sport coupe and sport sedan lineups have always been standard-bearers for innovative technology, craftsmanship, and exhilarating performance.

It was the top-selling automobile in its segment from 1994 - 1998. It is available on five sport-coupe trim levels and three sport- sedan trims. The Intergra LS came with a 1.8-liter, 140-hp engine, automatic transmission is optional.

2004 - 2005 Scion xA  Overall MPG: 31/30

The Scion xA's body lines are rounder and more sculpted than the distinctly boxy shape of its xB cousin, but it's just as well-constructed and just as comfy inside. Low maintenance costs are a big selling point, as is the taut ride.

A 1.5-liter, 108-hp 16-valve four-cylinder comes standard on the 2004 - 2005, along with a five-speed manual transmission, and an automatic transmission was optional.
