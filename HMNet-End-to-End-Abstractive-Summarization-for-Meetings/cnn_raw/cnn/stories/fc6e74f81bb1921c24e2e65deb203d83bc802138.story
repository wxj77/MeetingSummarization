(CNN) -- A Japanese man accused of operating a drug trafficking ring between Mexico and Japan was arrested in Mexico last week, the Ministry of Public Security said Saturday.

Phanor Eriko Kuratomi, known as "El Casio," was arrested Friday in Mexico City, according to a ministry news release.

The arrest was the result of an investigation that revealed that Eriko Kuratomi, a Japanese citizen, used women to transport drugs in their bodies.

Also arrested were three women, including 30-year-old Zaira Apodaca Vera, who is believed to have transported drugs in her body, and Isabel Alamilla Roa, 40, who had served time in prison for being part of a group of women who smuggled drugs into Mexican jails.

Also arrested was Juan Ignacio Angeles Reyes, accused of recruiting the women to travel to Japan and driving them to the airport.

The police secured one and a half kilos of cocaine and plane tickets to Tokyo.
