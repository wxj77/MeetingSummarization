(CNN) -- Dubai already has the world's tallest building, the world's largest shopping mall, and the largest man-made archipelago. So it's no surprise that the country's police would drive one of the world's most extravagant and expensive cars.

The latest addition to the force's fleet is a head-turning Lamborghini Aventador, finished in green and white -- the colors of the Dubai Police force.

The force made the announcement through its Twitter feed, @DubaiPoliceHQ, resulting in a flurry of tweets with the hash tag #OnlyinDubai.

Twitter user @eJbacher_says said: "Lambo Cop Cars. Do not speed in Dubai. They will hunt you down and in Italian sports cars."

Another tweet from @knicks20 read: " Wouldn't mind being pulled over by the popo in dubai... Lambo cop cars..."

In a written statement, the force said the car, which bears the number 8 on a customized license plate, would be a step towards confirming the stature of Dubai as "a city of luxury in all of its facilities."

According to recent figures, 15% of traffic fines issued in Dubai are for driving at speeds in excess of 130 mph (209 kph.)

The car, reported to be worth around $500,000, has a maximum speed of 217 mph (349kph) and can accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-97 kph) in 2.9 seconds.

Dubai police are not the first force to use Lamborghinis on the roads. The luxury sports vehicles are also used by forces in Italy and Qatar.
