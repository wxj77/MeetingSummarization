(CNN) -- A runaway horse that injured six people at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center on Saturday has been captured, police say.

The horse got loose, then ran down a trail, colliding with horseback riders and pedestrians.

The horse injured three adults and three children, according to the Burbank Police Twitter account. All of them had minor injuries, Burbank police Sgt. Jerry Misquez said.

The center is "centrally located within Griffith Park" and has access to more than 50 miles of horse trails in the park, its website says.

Patrons can rent horses, board their horses or watch equestrian events, according to the center.

The equestrian center is hosting the 25th annual Equestfest on Sunday. The event showcases many of the equestrian units that will participate in the Rose Parade on New Year's Day, according to the Tournament of Roses website.
