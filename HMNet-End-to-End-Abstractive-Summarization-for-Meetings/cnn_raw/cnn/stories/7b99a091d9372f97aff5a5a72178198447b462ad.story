(CNN) -- Tiger Woods will follow his agent, Mark Steinberg, to Excel Sports Management, the company announced Monday.

Steinberg joined Excel after more than a decade of working for sports agency IMG.

"After meeting with a number of agencies and businesses, I decided Excel was the perfect fit," Steinberg said in a prepared statement.

The Golf Channel tweeted Sunday that the network would air a "special announcement" concerning Woods. Speculation swirled that the golfer would personally make a statement.

The former world No. 1 had already announced that he will miss this week's British Open championship at Sandwich, England, because of injuries to his left leg.

Woods, a three-time British Open winner, has not played since mid-May because of the problems.

On his official website last week, Woods said: "Unfortunately, I've been advised that I should not play in the British Open.

"As I stated at the AT&T National, I am only going to come back when I'm 100% ready as I do not want to risk further injury."

He continued: "That's different for me, but I'm being smarter this time. I'm very disappointed and want to express my regrets to the British Open fans."

Woods suffered injuries to his left knee and left Achilles tendon during the Masters in April and withdrew after nine holes of the Players Championship when he inflamed his leg again.

"In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have competed at the Players but it's a big event, and I wanted to be there to support the PGA Tour," Woods added.

"I've got to learn from what I did there and do it right this time and not come back until I'm ready.

"I think my best years are still ahead of me, and I'm very confident and optimistic about the future," he said.

The 35-year-old Woods, winner of the British Open in 2000, 2005 and 2006, also missed the 2008 tournament at Royal Birkdale following reconstructive knee surgery after his U.S. Open victory a month earlier.
