(EW.com) -- The Producers Guild of America has announced its 10 nominees for Best Picture of the Year, and along with expected contenders like "The Artist," "War Horse," "The Descendants," "The Help," and "Hugo" were two minor surprises: "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" and "The Ides of March."

Left off the list, meanwhile, were "Drive," "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close," and most interestingly, "The Tree of Life." That polarizing film, which has done well in the critics awards so far, clearly takes the biggest hit in the overall Oscar race and is no longer a sure thing for a Best Picture nomination.

Last year, the PGA honorees matched the eventual Best Picture nominees nine for 10, but this year it may not be as easy to compare the two -- the Academy's new voting rules dictate that there will be somewhere between five and 10 Best Picture nominees this go-round, depending on how many films receive at least 5 percent of the overall No. 1 votes. The PGA awards will take place on Jan. 21; all the nominees are listed below.
