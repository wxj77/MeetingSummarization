(CNN) -- Lukas Rosol, who beat Rafael Nadal in one of the biggest upsets in Wimbledon history, came crashing down to earth Saturday with a straight sets exit to Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round.

Czech Rosol had swept the second seed aside under the Centre Court lights Thursday night but out on Court 12 could not recreate that magic.

27th seed Kohlschreiber, who had also beaten Nadal on grass at Halle two weeks ago, cruised to a 6-2 6-3 7-6 victory.

"Rosol is a big server," the German told the official Wimbledon website. "But I read his serve pretty well today. In the first set I think I played some amazing tennis."

Rosol will return to a second tier Challenger Tour event next week, but Kohlschreiber has earned himself a last 16 clash with American Brian Baker.

Qualifier Baker, who has made an astonishing return to the ATP after six years sidelined through a string of injuries, beat Benoit Paire of France 6-4 4-6 6-1 6-3.

"It's been unreal," said Baker, who is set to rise well inside the top 100 with his recent performances.

He is one of two Americans in the last 16, with Mardy Fish going through after a three set win over Belgian wildcard David Goffin, but their compatriot Andy Roddick is out.

The three-time Wimbledon runner-up was beaten 2-6 7-6 6-4 6-3 by Spanish seventh seed David Ferrer.

Roddick looked on the way to a fine victory when he took the first set in comprehensive fashion, but Ferrrer dug in to level and then took command.

The 29-year-old Roddick, who won the warm-up tournament at Eastbourne, waved to all sides of Centre Court as he departed, increasing speculation about his future.

He lost finals to Roger Federer in 2004, 2005 and 2009, but has slipped down the rankings over the past year.

Ferrer will next play Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina, who dispatched Kei Nishikori of Japan 6-3 7-6 6-1, while Fish will face French fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who beat Slovakia's Lukas Lacko 6-4 6-3 6-3 to continue his easy run through the draw.

Sam Querrey also came up short in a marathon bid to become the third player from the United States into the third round as he lost to 16th seed Marin Cilic in a match taking five hours 31 minutes.

Croatian Cilic finally triumphed 7-6 6-4 6-7 6-717-15, the final set lasting more than two hours on its own.

It was the second longest match in Wimbledon history behind the world record clash between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut in 2010.

Cilic will play British fourth seed Andy Murray, who won a late night thriller under the Centre Court lights to beat Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus.

Baghdatis leveled at one set all and was a break up in the third set before Murray hit back to win 7-5 3-6 7-5 6-1 in a match that finished at 2300 local.
