(CNN)In case you didn't know, Neil deGrasse Tyson is hiring.

The famed astrophysicist has a new late-night show coming to the National Geographic Channel, titled "Star Talk." That fact seemed to amuse Conan O'Brien, who jokingly wondered Tuesday on his own late-night gig, "Who would go work on a show like that?"

Be careful what you ask, Conan.

Quicker than you could say "total eclipse," the moon that is part of the "Conan" backdrop spoke up to say he would like to join Tyson's new project. Shortly thereafter, the man himself strode out.

He was soon courting Conan's right-hand man, Andy Richter, asking whether he'd like a job on the show.

"Andy may be small in time and space, but he is a universe unto himself, comprised of atoms whose origins can be traced back to the stars that exploded billions of years ago," Tyson said before leading Richter offstage.

The skit helped hype Tyson's new show, which is based on his very popular podcast. "Star Talk" is set to premiere in April.
