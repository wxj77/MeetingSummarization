(CNN) -- Detroit, Michigan, Police Chief Warren Evans has resigned, the city announced Wednesday.

"We appreciate the time and dedication that Warren Evans has given to the Detroit Police Department," Mayor Dave Bing said in a statement. "He has put the department on a path to reducing crime."

The mayor named Assistant Chief Ralph Godbee as interim police chief.

"I got some information on some things that had happened in our police department," Bing said at news conference. "I thought Chief Evans, some of his decisions, I think compromised his position as chief, and because of that, I've made the decision to replace him."

Bing declined to go into details of what the decisions were that led to Evans' resignation. He would only say that the move was based on feedback both internally and externally over a period of time.

"It's a combination of a lot of things that happened," Bing said.

Evans came under fire in May when he allowed a reality film crew to follow officers as they executed a search warrant for a murder suspect, CNN affiliate WDIV reported. During the incident, an officer was accused of shooting and killing a 7-year-old girl who was sleeping inside of the home.

Evans became the third Detroit police within a year when he assumed the position last summer, WDIV reported.

"We've made some tremendous strides in the police department with a data-driven approach to solving crime," Godbee said. "Those things we are doing successfully, we will continue to build on."
