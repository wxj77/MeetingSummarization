(CNN) -- The body of football star Christian Benitez arrived in his native Ecuador Friday ahead of his funeral and other tributes in the capital Quito later in the day.

The coffin was accompanied on the flight from Doha in Qatar by his wife Liseth Chala and other grieving relatives.

The 27-year-old Ecuadorian international striker died Monday after playing his first match for Qatari league side El Jaish, coming on as a second half substitute.

The club said Wednesday that Benitez had died of heart failure after developing peritonitis.

Benitez's agent said he had complained of abdominal pains before being taken to hospital.

The striker scored 24 goals in 54 games for Ecuador, playing in the 2006 World Cup as a youngster.

He had scored four goals in Ecuador's qualifying campaign for the 2014 finals in Brazil.

His club career saw Benitez ply his trade in Mexico, in the English Premier League with Birmingham, before heading to Qatar.

El Jaish played their first match since his death Thursday, with a minute's silence observed before taking on Al Shahaniya in a pre-season tournament.

His teammates held up a banner with is picture and the words "Christian Benitez We Will Miss You" before playing out a 4-4 draw.
