(CNN) -- Undefeated wonder horse Black Caviar maintained her perfect record with a convincing win on Saturday in a race named after her -- the Black Caviar Lightening Stakes at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne.

The six-year-old superstar, who has now won all 23 of her races, had been on the brink of retirement after sustaining muscle damage during a narrow victory in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot last June.

But she has been gradually regaining full fitness under trainer Peter Moody, who used a combination of hydrotherapy and laser treatment to get his charge back in racing trim.

"We were on a hiding to nothing by bringing her back," Moody said.

"The job was done and we thought it was over, but to come back and do that and run a record, I'm lost for words," he added.
