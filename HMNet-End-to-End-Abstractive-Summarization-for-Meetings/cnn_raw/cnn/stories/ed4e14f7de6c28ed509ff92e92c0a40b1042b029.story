London (CNN) -- Prince Philip has left the hospital where he has been recuperating since abdominal surgery on June 7.

The Duke of Edinbugh, 92, walked out unaided Monday.

He was admitted to the hospital on June 6.

Philip will convalesce at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace said Monday after he left a London hospital.

Prince Philip: The man behind the queen

Philip left Greece a year after he was born there, following the 1922 overthrow of his uncle King Constantine I.

Despite his roots, he has a mixed ancestry and, like his wife, is a great-great-grandchild of Britain's Queen Victoria.

A Royal Navy veteran, he met Elizabeth in 1939 and married her in November 1947. They have four children.

In addition to his royal and military duties, Philip has served as president of the World Wildlife Fund and the International Equestrian Foundation.

Philip has had a number of documented health problems in recent years, including treatment for a blocked coronary artery in December 2011 and a hospitalization in June 2012 for a bladder infection.

He was admitted again to a hospital -- this time in Scotland -- for treatment of the latter ailment two months later.
