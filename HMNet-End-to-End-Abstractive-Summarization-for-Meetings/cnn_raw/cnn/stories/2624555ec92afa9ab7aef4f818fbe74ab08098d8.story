(CNNGO) -- Money's worth nothing, until you spend it.

That's the philosophy behind all extravagant luxury goods, and nothing says "senseless overspending" like blowing thousands on a place to sleep, shower and store your clothes while you go about your day.

For anyone with a few hundred thousand to squander, this is a to-do list. For the rest of us, it's a can't-do, won't-do, don't-even-want-to-do list.

15. Peninsula Suite, The Peninsula, Hong Kong

US$10,000 per night

A stay at Hong Kong's grande dame begins at the airport, where you're picked up by a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce, part of The Pen's signature fleet.

Or, if you're feeling really flash (and flush), you can arrive by helicopter -- the hotel has two rooftop helipads for their super-rich guests.

At more than 371 square meters, The Peninsula suite, on the 26th floor, provides the most stunning vistas over Victoria Harbour, along with a 24-hour butler and chauffeur service, mini-gym and fully equipped kitchen.
