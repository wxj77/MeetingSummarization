(CNN) -- Spanish motorcycling star Dani Pedrosa has had successful surgery to remove a titanium plate from his shoulder, it was announced on Wednesday.

The Honda rider, second in last year's MotoGP world championship, had the plate inserted last October after suffering a double fracture to his collarbone in the Japanese Grand Prix.

The 25-year-old experienced numbness during Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, so chose to have the operation during a break in the 2011 calendar.

The next race in the elite division's season is not until May 1 in Portugal because this year's race in Japan was canceled due to the devastation caused by last month's earthquake and tsunami.

"Dani Pedrosa has undergone successful surgery at Teknon Medical Center, in Barcelona, to decompress his left subclavian artery and is expected to recover satisfactorily," the official MotoGP website reported.

"In order to release the arterial compression, the titanium plate and the screws fixed to the collarbone have been removed.

"Pedrosa will remain in hospital for a further 48 hours to continue treatment with analgesia and anti-inflammatories."

The Sabadell native will be assessed by doctors next week to decide if he will be fit for the next round of competition in Estoril.

Pedrosa, who moved up to MotoGP class in 2006, is currently second in the standings after two races thanks to his second-place finish last weekend in Jerez.

He is nine points behind his compatriot Jorge Lorenzo of Yamaha, the reigning champion, who won his home race for the second year in a row.

A two-time 250cc class world champion and once titleholder in the 125cc class, Pedrosa has won 12 races at the highest level but is yet to claim his maiden title.
