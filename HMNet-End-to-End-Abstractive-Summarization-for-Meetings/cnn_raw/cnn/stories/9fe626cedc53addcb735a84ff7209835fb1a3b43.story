London (CNN)Actor and writer Stephen Fry confirmed Tuesday via Twitter that he plans to marry his partner, named in UK media as 27-year-old Elliott Spencer.

Fry, a prolific tweeter with more than 8 million followers, made the announcement after a report in Britain's Sun newspaper -- saying he was very happy.

According to UK media reports, Fry plans to marry in Dereham, in the county of Norfolk, where he's from.

The news was apparently well received by his legion of fans.

Same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales last March.

Fry, who appears in Peter Jackson's "Hobbit" movies, has been a familiar face on TV screens for years, as well being the author of several books.

He starred with actor Hugh Laurie in the comedy series "A Bit of Fry and Laurie," "Jeeves and Wooster" and "Blackadder," as well as hosting the comedy quiz show "QI."

In 2008, he made the six-part BBC series "Stephen Fry in America," in which he visited all 50 states.

Fry has spoken openly about his struggles with manic depression and his diagnosis of bipolar disorder, as well as being an advocate for gay rights.
