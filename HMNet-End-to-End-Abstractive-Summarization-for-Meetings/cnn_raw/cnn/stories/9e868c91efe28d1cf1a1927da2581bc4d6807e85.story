(CNN) -- Adam Levine has pulled a musical coup on "The Voice."

The Maroon 5 frontman has proudly welcomed legend Stevie Nicks to his "team" on the NBC singing reality competition.

"#TeamAdam, welcome the incredible Stevie Nicks as your Season 7 advisor!" said a post on "The Voice's" Instagram July 9.

One of NBC's most popular shows, "The Voice" regularly updates its roster of celebrity talent. After starting off with Christina Aguilera, Blake Shelton, Cee Lo Green and Levine as its quad of mentors, recent seasons have also featured Usher and Shakira in those spinning red chairs. For season 7, which will launch in the fall, the coaching lineup will be Levine and Shelton along with new mentors Gwen Stefani and Pharrell Williams.

The job of the coaches is to build teams of singers with the hope of picking the "Voice" that will win it all; the job of an adviser like Nicks is to help out during rehearsals and offer expertise to the competitors. And the Fleetwood Mac songstress is no stranger to the show; back in Season 1, she sang a duet of "Landslide" with eventual winner Javier Colon.

"I just think it's a great show," Nicks told "Extra" of her new gig. "And I know (Adam Levine) would never still be sitting here seven years later if this wasn't a great show."

But how did Levine pull off getting a great like Nicks?

"Bribery, begging, pleading," Levine joked with "Extra." "Lot of gifts ... Anything she wanted."

The seventh season of "The Voice" will premiere September 22 on NBC.
