Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Asiana Airlines said it is paying $10,000 to each of the passengers aboard Flight 214, which crashed in San Francisco last month.

"It is separate to medical compensation," spokeswoman Lee Hyo-min told CNN on Monday. She said even those who were not injured can receive payment.

The spokeswoman added that passengers who collect the money "can still sue us."

Three people were killed after the plane crashed short of the runway on July 6 at San Francisco International Airport.

The San Mateo County coroner said one of those killed, 16-year-old Ye Mengyuan of China, was flung out of the plane and survived. But she was struck and killed by a rescue vehicle.

San Francisco Fire Department Chief Joanne Hayes-White has apologized to Ye's family.

"We're heartbroken. We're in the business of saving lives," she said. "There's not a lot of words to describe how badly we feel about it."

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash, which also injured more than 180 people aboard the flight.
