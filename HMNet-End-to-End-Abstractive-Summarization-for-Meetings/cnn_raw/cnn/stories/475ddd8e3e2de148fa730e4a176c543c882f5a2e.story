Tokyo (CNN) -- Toyota on Wednesday announced recalls involving more than 1.5 million vehicles worldwide for issues that could result in fuel leakage, the company said.

One recall involves about 1.2 million units of 16 models -- including the Noah and other models -- within Japan and 140,000 Avensis and Tourer models overseas because of faulty fuel pipes that could cause fuel leakage, according to the company.

A separate recall involves 245,000 2006 through 2007 Lexus GS300/350 vehicles, 2006 through early 2009 Lexus IS250 vehicles and 2006 through early 2008 Lexus IS350 vehicles sold in the United States to inspect the fuel pressure sensor installation, according to a company statement.

"Due to insufficient tightening of the fuel pressure sensor connected to certain engine fuel delivery pipes ... there is a possibility that the pressure sensor could loosen over time," the statement said.

"Lexus dealers will inspect the vehicle for fuel leakage and if no leakage is found, will tighten the fuel pressure sensor with the proper torque. If a fuel leak is confirmed, the gasket between the sensor and the delivery pipe will be replaced and the sensor will be tightened with the proper torque."

The inspection and possible gasket replacement will be conducted at no charge to the vehicle owner, according to the company statement.

Toyota said no accidents have been reported in relation to the recalls.
