New York (CNN) -- A New York City grand jury indicted an alleged drug kingpin and three suspected associates Monday after authorities seized a stash of methamphetamine and heroin valued at more than $6.5 million, the Drug Enforcement Administration said.

Jose Mauro Mota and his alleged co-conspirators were arrested in July after a "record-breaking" seizure, officials said.

Authorities said they found 51 pounds of crystal methamphetamine, valued at $4.8 million. Also seized was 11 pounds of heroin, valued at about $1.75 million.

"This is one of the largest and highest-purity methamphetamine seizures with the end destination - -the Big Apple," John P. Gilbride, head of the DEA's New York field division, said in a prepared statement. "The New York Drug Enforcement Task Force and the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor worked collaboratively in order to disrupt this multi-drug smuggling organization and arrest those responsible for dealing meth in and around NYC."

Mota faces multiple drug possession charges, authorities said. His alleged associates also face drug charges.

Mota, Deivis Rafael Ceballos, Cesar Primitivo Lara and Romedi Lara-Serrano were arrested on July 3 on Interstate 95, near a service area in Ridgefield, New Jersey, following a two-week investigation, authorities said in a news release.

Authorities said they learned of the alleged drug shipment as agents used a court-authorized wiretap to listen to Mota's phone conversations.

Authorities then followed the shipment, which originated in Mexico, through Texas and then across country, the news release said.

The drugs were being transferred from a tractor-trailer to a car at the time of the seizure, it said.

Mota and Ceballos also face charges under New York's kingpin statute dealing with operating as a major trafficker, the news release said. This is the only felony narcotics charge in New York that comes with a possible life sentence.
