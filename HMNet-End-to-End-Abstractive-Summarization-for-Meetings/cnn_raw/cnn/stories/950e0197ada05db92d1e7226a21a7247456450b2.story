(CNN) -- You probably won't see any "Pan Am" glamour in the newest television program focusing on an airline, but you can still expect plenty of drama.

TLC has ordered a new reality series that will take viewers behind the scenes at Southwest Airlines.

Production begins this weekend at Baltimore Washington International Airport and Denver International Airport, just in time for the holiday travel rush.

More airports will be added in the coming weeks.

TLC promises "unprecedented access" that will reveal what it takes for Southwest to transport passengers in the era of packed planes, unruly passengers and countless air travel frustrations.

The series of 13 half-hour episodes will also profile some of the airline's customers "as they prepare to travel for milestone moments," TLC says.

"Air travel has become incredibly accessible, and as a result, millions of travelers navigate the challenges of the airport, especially during the upcoming holiday season," said Amy Winter, general manager of TLC, in a statement.

"Southwest is a beloved brand, and their customers and employees will reveal the passion, commitment, and fantastic payoff of 'getting there' that helps keep us all flying."

Southwest is no stranger to reality TV cameras. The carrier was the subject of "Airline," a series that ran on A&E in 2004 and 2005. The network canceled the show after three seasons.

The title and premiere date of TLC's series have yet to be set.
