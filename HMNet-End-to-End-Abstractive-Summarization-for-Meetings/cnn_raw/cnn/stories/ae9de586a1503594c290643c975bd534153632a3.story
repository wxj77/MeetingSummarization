(CNN) -- James Franco and Seth Rogen are going above and beyond for their new movie.

The pair appeared Sunday in a special episode of the Discovery Channel series "Naked and Afraid," and it was ... illuminating.

The show features folks dropped into the wild sans clothing; they must then survive in the wilderness for 21 days. It was obvious that Sunday's episode was going to be a bit different for the Hollywood BFFs, whose new film "The Interview" is out December 25.

"I was hoping to be teamed up with a woman, but I guess Franco is the next best thing," Rogen said. "He's pretty much hairless. Take your glasses off, he's pretty much a woman."

The naughty bits were blurred, but it didn't seem to matter to Franco, who clearly enjoyed the freedom.

"I'm actually really comfortable being naked," he said. "If I could, I'd be naked all the time. It's just that I'm famous, and if I'm naked, everyone loves to talk about it, and it becomes an international event."

Participants are allowed to bring one item with them. The ever-practical Rogen brought toilet paper, while Franco brought sunglasses. It was obvious the latter took the adventure lightly as he exclaimed, "Naked ain't afraid, even a little bit!"

What followed was plenty of comedy and some awkward spooning.

Rogen and Franco have shown that they don't mind pushing the envelope. Rogen even dropped in on Saturday while Franco hosted "Saturday Night Live."

They joked about the recent hack of Sony, the studio behind their new film, claiming that the hackers had gotten hold of some sensitive photos of them together. The "leaked photos" included Rogen teaching Franco how to read, their nude Christmas card and Rogen wearing control-top pantyhose."

"I was just trying to look slimmer," Rogen said.
