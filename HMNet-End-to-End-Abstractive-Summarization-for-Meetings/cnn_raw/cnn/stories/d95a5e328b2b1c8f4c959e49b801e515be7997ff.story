(CNN) -- A Norwegian court sentenced three people Monday for their roles in a plot to attack a Danish newspaper that published cartoons depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammed.

Mikael Davud, Shawan Sadek Saeed Bujak Bujak and David Jakobsen were convicted in connection with a plot to carry out explosions at offices of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper.

Davud and Bujak were convicted of terror charges, while Jakobsen was convicted of a lesser explosives charge.

Davud, a Norwegian citizen of Uyghur origin, was sentenced to seven years in prison. Bujak, an Iraqi-Kurdish man with Norwegian residency, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison, and Jakobsen, originally from Uzbekistan, was sentenced to four months in prison. All three defendants have already served 606 days in custody, which will be deducted from their sentences, Oslo District Court spokesman Markus Iestra said.

Authorities also accused Davud and Bujak of plotting to shoot cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, who drew an image of the Muslim prophet Mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban that was published in Jyllands-Posten in 2005.

The controversy grew in early 2006 when a Norwegian newspaper reprinted the drawings. Islamic law generally bans any depiction of Mohammed.

Norwegian authorities have said Davud, Bujak and Jakobsen were suspected of having connections to al Qaeda.

In July 2010, Norwegian officials said Davud, Bujak and Jakobsen were arrested in connection with an ongoing investigation into terrorist plots in New York and the United Kingdom.
