This is one hotel where getting stuck with a "city view" could be frustrating.

A new midtown Marriott -- The Courtyard-Residence Inn Central Park -- is claiming the title of North America's tallest hotel.

Opened December 29, the $320 million, 68-story building houses two separate hotels -- a Courtyard and a Residence Inn -- at 1717 Broadway.

The Courtyard's 378 rooms are located on floors 6-33, while the 261-suite Residence Inn is housed on the upper level floors 37-65. The latter is only available for stays of five nights or more.

A 60-second time-lapse video of the 27 months of the hotel's construction can be seen here.

Located five blocks from Central Park and about 10 minutes from Times Square, the dual-branded hotel offers valet parking, a bistro, 6,000 square feet of meeting space, an outdoor sun deck and Wi-Fi included in the room rate.

According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), the 750-foot new Marriott beats out a sister hotel for the title -- the 727-foot Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center.

Neither comes close to being the tallest hotel in the world, however. Many of the world's tallest hotels are in Dubai, with the tallest being another Marriott -- the 1,164-foot JW Marriott Marquis.

The new Marriott's claims are being contested by another U.S. hotel, the Westin Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta. Although CTBUH and other websites list the Plaza as being 723 feet tall, hotel reps say its real height is 754 feet, which would make it taller than the Courtyard-Residence Inn Central Park by four feet.
