(CNN)"Transformers" may not do well at the Oscars, but the Razzies love movies about the Earth-destroying contraptions.

"Transformers: Age of Extinction," the fourth chapter in Michael Bay's ear-splitting explosion-fest, led all films with seven Golden Raspberry Award nominations, which go out to the worst films and performances of the year.

Bay received a nomination for worst director, and the film picked up nominations for worst screenplay, worst supporting actor (Kelsey Grammer, a nod that also lumped in his performances in "The Expendables 3," "Legends of Oz" and "Think Like a Man Too") and worst screen combo ("any two robots, actors or robotic actors").

It's not the first time a "Transformers" has vied for the top -- or bottom -- spot. "Transformers: Dark of the Moon" was nominated for worst picture of 2011, and "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" won the big prize as 2009's bottom of the cinematic barrel.

Close behind "Age of Extinction" (styled "Age of Ex-STINK-tion" in the news release) were "Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas" and "The Legend of Hercules," both of which received six nominations.

Cameron, the former "Growing Pains" star, received a worst actor and worst screen combo nomination. The latter went to "Kirk Cameron & His Ego."

Also doing well: Seth MacFarlane, who was nominated for worst actor and worst screen combo (with Charlize Theron) for his "A Million Ways to Die in the West."

The Razzies are trying to be forgiving this year, however. There's a new category, the Razzie Redeemer Award, for former winners who have gone on to better things. This year's nominees are Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Mike Myers, Keanu Reeves and Kristen Stewart.

The Razzies are chosen by 757 members of the Golden Raspberry Awards Foundation. However, the Razzie Redeemer Award will be open to voting by the public through RottenTomatoes.com.

The awards ceremony will be held February 21 -- the night before the Oscars -- at Hollywood's Montalban Theatre.
