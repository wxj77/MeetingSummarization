(CNN Student News) -- March 26, 2014

A landslide, a rescue effort, and a state of emergency: Today's show updates you on a tragic natural disaster in Washington state. We also cover how and why the U.S. first lady is encouraging students to study abroad, though it's not an option for everyone. And if athletes at Northwestern University are allowed to unionize, it could change the playing field for college sports.
