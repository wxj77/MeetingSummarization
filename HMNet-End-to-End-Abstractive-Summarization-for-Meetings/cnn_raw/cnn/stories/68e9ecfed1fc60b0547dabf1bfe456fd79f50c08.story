(CNN) -- HBO and the "Game of Thrones" producers have apologized for comments made on the season one DVD about a prosthetic head that looks suspiciously like our nation's 43rd President.

In the commentary, show creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss admit that George W. Bush's likeness appears in a scene in which King Joffrey shows Sansa Stark her dead dad's head on a stick. (Check it out on io9.com). The alleged Dubya noggin is the last one on the left â€” and he's sporting some pretty bad hair.

"It's not a choice, not a political statement!" one of the writers say during the commentary. "We just had to use what heads we had around."

Once news of the Bush head hit the internet, HBO released this statement: "We were deeply dismayed to see this and find it unacceptable, disrespectful and in very bad taste. We made this clear to the executive producers of the series who apologized immediately for this inadvertent careless mistake. We are sorry this happened and will have it removed from any future DVD production."

The producing duo released their own, too: "We use a lot of prosthetic body parts on the show: heads, arms, etc. We can't afford to have these all made from scratch, especially in scenes where we need a lot of them, so we rent them in bulk. After the scene was already shot, someone pointed out that one of the heads looked like George W. Bush. In the DVD commentary, we mentioned this, though we should not have. We meant no disrespect to the former President and apologize if anything we said or did suggested otherwise."

On the DVD, one of the writers claims that the Bush head appears in a "couple of beheading scenes."
