(CNN) -- At least 20 people were killed Thursday morning when a bus veered off a road in central Turkey, the country's semi-official Anadolu news agency said.

The bus overturned and landed on its side at the bottom of a snowy slope in the town of Pinarbasi. Another 28 people were injured, Anadolu said, citing a local governor.

As many as 50 people may have been on the bus.

After the crash, passenger Selcan Aydın said she had no idea where her child was.

"We were sleeping, my baby was in my lap. But I don't know where my baby is now," Aydin told Anadolu. "When I woke up, I was under the bus."

Her husband, Asım Aydın, told the agency he looked for his two children after the crash.

"I could not find either of them. There were dead people around me," he said.

By late Thursday morning, most of the bodies had been pulled out from the wreckage, Anadolu said.

The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.
