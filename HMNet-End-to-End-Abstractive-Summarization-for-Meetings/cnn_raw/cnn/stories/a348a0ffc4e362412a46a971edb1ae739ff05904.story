(CNN) -- Four people were presumed dead Monday after a small airplane crashed near the John C. Tune Airport in Nashville, Tennessee, authorities said.

Four members from the same family were believed to be on board, and there were no survivors, said Don Aaron with the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department.

The airplane crashed beside the Bellevue YMCA. No other injuries were reported.

The flight left Great Bend Municipal Airport in Great Bend, Kansas, and was preparing for a second approach to the Nashville airport when the accident occurred, Aaron said.

The cause of the crash was not clear.

The Federal Aviation Administration was on scene, and the National Transportation Safety Board was expected to be there by Tuesday morning.
