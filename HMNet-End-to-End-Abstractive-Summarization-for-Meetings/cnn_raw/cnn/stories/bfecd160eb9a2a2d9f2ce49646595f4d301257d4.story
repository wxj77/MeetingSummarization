(CNN) -- An unruly passenger aboard a cross-country American Airlines flight forced the plane to make an unscheduled landing in Phoenix, according to police and a passenger on board.

American Airlines Flight 1488 left Los Angeles International Airport Thursday heading for Miami.

A 21-year-old Hispanic male started behaving erratically during the flight, according to Sgt. Steve Martos, a spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department.

"Two guys and a girl, they held the guy down till we got on the ground," said passenger Janine Sharell.

Martos said the flight crew decided to divert the plane and make an unscheduled landing at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

Police officers boarded the plane when it landed and removed the unidentified man. "Based on observations from the flight crew and our officers, the passenger was taken to an area hospital where he received medical attention, Martos said.
