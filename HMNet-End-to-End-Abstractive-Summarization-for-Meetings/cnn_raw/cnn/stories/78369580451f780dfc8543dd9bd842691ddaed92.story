FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (CNN)  -- An elementary school teacher was arrested for punching an 8-year-old student in the face this month, Fort Lauderdale police said Tuesday.

David Adam Grant is accused of striking an 8-year-old student at a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, school.

David Adam Grant, 36, an art teacher at Sunland Elementary School, turned himself in to police Tuesday in connection with the November 5 incident, authorities said in a written statement.

Police responded to a report of battery at the school, and "preliminary investigations revealed that an 8-year-old student ... had been battered."

Authorities allege that Grant "hit the 8-year-old student around his left eye with a loosely closed fist, causing a bruise over his right eye," according to the police statement.

Grant surrendered to police after detectives contacted him, the statement said. He faces child abuse charges. The incident remains under investigation, authorities said.
