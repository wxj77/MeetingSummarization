New Delhi (CNN)At least 11 passengers were killed when a train jumped the rails in southern India on Friday, authorities said.

Nine cars of the Bengaluru-Ernakulam Express train derailed some 50 kilometers from Bangalore in Karnataka state at around 7.30 am local time, said Chandrashekhar Gupta, a spokesman for India's southwestern railway.

Rescue crews have retrieved 11 bodies from the wrecked compartments, Gupta told CNN. More than 25 people were injured in the derailment, nine of them critically, he added.

India's vast railway network runs 7,000 trains serving 13 million passengers every day, according to officials.

But the country's rail safety record is poor, with several accidents reported each year.

Authorities say they are using new technology and training their workforce to try to improve safety standards.
