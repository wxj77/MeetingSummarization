NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenyans observed a minute of silence Thursday to mark the 10 year anniversary of al Qaeda terrorists bombing the U.S. embassy in the capital of Nairobi, killing more than 200 people and wounding 5,000.

Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga laid a wreath at the memorial site, at the spot where the embassy building used to stand.

A smaller memorial was being held at the new embassy compound, and a separate memorial was happening in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where another bombing went off nearly simultaneously at the U.S. Embassy and killed 11 people.

A decade later, many victims say the U.S. government owes them compensation.

The U.S. Congress allocated $40 million to rebuild parts of Nairobi and provide "humanitarian assistance" to victims, but no financial compensation.

"This indeed has been very painful to the victims -- and the survivors, for that matter," said Douglas Sidialo, who was left blinded by the bombing. Sidialo was driving by the embassy and says the last thing he saw was the truck carrying the bomb turn toward the embassy gates.  Watch more about the fallout from the bombings 10 years on Â»

Last weekend Kenyan police said that Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, indicted in the United States for alleged involvement in the bombings, managed to evade police in a raid in Malindi, along Kenya's coast.

The United States calls Mohammed a senior al Qaeda operative in East Africa and believes he was also involved in attacks on an Israeli-owned hotel and airliner in Kenya in 2002.

It has offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the apprehension or conviction of Mohammed, who is on FBI's Most Wanted.
