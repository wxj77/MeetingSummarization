(CNN) -- With national polls and polls in many of the battleground states essentially tied just days before November 6, the winner of the presidential election is anybody's guess. So, by the numbers, here's a look at some offbeat predictors of presidential elections:

62.1 - Percent of sales of the President Obama "Chia" planter, as of October 23.

37.1 - Percent of sales of the Mitt Romney "Chia" planter as of October 23.

80 (4 out of 5) - Percent of Family Circle magazine Presidential Cookie Bake-off winners who became first lady after her husband won the election. (Cindy McCain was the one winner who was a loser.)

54 - Percent of the recipes in the Family Circle Presidential Cookie Bake-offs that include chocolate chips.

16 - Elections in a row, from 1936 until 1996, where the incumbent party stayed in office if the Washington Redskins football team won at home in their last game before the election. (The so-called Redskins Rule didn't apply in 2000, 2004 and 2008.)

60 - Percent of sales received at the Spirit Halloween seasonal store for the President Barack Obama mask.

40 - Percent of sales received at the Spirit Halloween season store for the Mitt Romney mask.

8 out of 9 - Correct predictions of the winner by the General Cinema movie theaters' "StrawVote" polls from 1968 until 2000. The last year of the poll, moviegoers chose Al Gore to win.

16 - States, mostly in the upper Midwest and in the South, which are unable to participate in the "7-11" convenience store "7-Election" coffee cup poll, because there are no "7-11" stores there.
