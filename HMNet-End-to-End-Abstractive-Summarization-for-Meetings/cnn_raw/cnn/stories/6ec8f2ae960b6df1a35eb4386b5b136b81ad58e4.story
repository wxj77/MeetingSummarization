(The Frisky)  -- Virgin Airlines heir Sam Branson was hanging out with Andy Roddick, and couldn't resist challenging him to a bet.

Andy Roddick played left-handed against Sam Branson and still won.

Branson wagered $150 that he could beat Roddick in a tennis match, as long as the right-handed sports star played with his left hand. Even as a leftie, Roddick cleaned up. They played one set and Branson didn't score a single point.

Since celebrities have so much money to throw around, they often amuse themselves by placing weird bets. Peep a few more who've put their money where their mouth is.

1. George Clooney was so convinced he'd still be childless and unmarried when he hit 40 that in 2001, he bet Nicole Kidman and Michelle Pfeiffer $10,000 each. The two gals just couldn't believe that this hunky dude wouldn't be tied down. But they were wrong. That's $20,000 for bachelor George! The Frisky: They dated? Hollywood's oddest hookups

2. Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry made a bet on the set of "The Whole Nine Yards." Perry allegedly thought the film would open at the top of the charts in the U.S. but Willis wasn't feelin' it.

When Bruce lost, he had to do a cameo on "Friends." Doesn't sound so bad, right? Well, he had to give away all the money he made. The good news is, he gave it to charity. The Frisky: Celebs whose new loves look just like their exes

3. Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio each bet $25,000 that the other would become a father first. The Frisky: Hollywood hotties set to play historical figures

When Maguire's fiance had their first kid, the actor had to pay up. He gave DiCaprio the cash, but didn't mind. Cause, uh, he was a dad.
