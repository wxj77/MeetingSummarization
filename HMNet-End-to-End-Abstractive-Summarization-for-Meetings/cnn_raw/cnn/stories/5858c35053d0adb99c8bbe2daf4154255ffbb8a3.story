(CNN) -- Jesper Parnevik admitted that he had "lost all respect" for fellow golfer Tiger Woods following revelations about the world number one's private life.

Woods apologized on his official Web site for "transgressions" and "personal sins and failings" on the same day that a gossip magazine published a story alleging that Woods had an affair with a 24-year-old New York cocktail waitress.

Former European Ryder Cup star Parnevik, 44, and his wife introduced fellow Swede Elin Nordegren to her future husband.

"It's always sad, and especially sad because me and my wife were at fault hooking her up with him and we probably thought he is a better guy than he is," Parnevik said.

"I would probably apologize to her and when you're a world-class athlete you probably should think a bit more before you do stuff.

"I haven't really talked to Tiger yet so I don't want to say too much but my heart goes out to her.

"There's nothing I regret saying and I stand by everything. He's lost all my respect, I mean, all the respect I had for the guy is gone, that's pretty much all I can say."

The rumors emerged after Woods, 33, was found bleeding and semi-conscious after his car hit a tree and fire hydrant outside his Florida home.

He was charged with careless driving, which carries a $164 fine and four points on his driving record.
