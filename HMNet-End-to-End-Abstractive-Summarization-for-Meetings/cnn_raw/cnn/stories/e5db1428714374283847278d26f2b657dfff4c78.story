(CNN) -- Forget about Pharrell Williams' hat. We're more interested in his skincare routine.

Somehow, the 40-year-old musical everyman has been in the business for roughly 20 years without appearing to have aged a single day.

As anyone with a job in the entertainment industry can tell you, that's not easy. Even the typical Hollywood attempts to appear younger end up going the opposite way.

But "Skateboard P" noticeably doesn't have such problems. The producer and performer's visage looks so youthful, some have even started to question whether there's a supernatural power involved.

The speculation has become so prominent that the Grammy winner recently decided to put the gossip to rest.

"No I am not (a vampire)," Pharrell told Time Out London this week. "I'm willing to go on record as saying that I don't drink people's blood."

Then, Pharrell graciously shared his personal fountain of youth to the masses: "How do I stay so young-looking for a 40-year-old?" I wash my face."

It's possible that answer won't satisfy conspiracy theorists, so we're going to toss out one of our own:

Maybe being "Happy" just goes a really long way.
