(CNN) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and midfielder Samir Nasri have both been charged with improper conduct by governing body UEFA following the London club's European Champions League elimination at the hands of Barcelona on Tuesday.

The French duo are alleged to have made comments to Swiss referee Massimo Busacca after Barcelona's 3-1 second leg win at the Camp Nou on Tuesday.

"UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Arsenal FC coach Arsene Wenger and the English club's midfielder Samir Nasri," read a UEFA statement.

"Both are to face charges of improper conduct, and their cases will be heard by the UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body on Thursday March 17."

Was Wenger right - did the referee kill the game?

The Gunners were angered by Busacca's decision to issue Dutchman Robin van Persie with a second yellow card in the 56th minute for kicking the ball away following an offside decision, although the striker claimed to have not heard the referee's whistle.

At that point the match was level at 1-1 after Lionel Messi had given Barca the lead on the stroke of half time, only for makeshift defender Sergio Busquets to head the ball into his own net in the second half.

Messi returns to haunt Arsenal

Once the visitors were reduced to 10 men Barcelona took control and a Xavi strike coupled with a Messi penalty helped the Catalans to a comfortable success.

Wenger, 61, and Nasri, 23, are both alleged to have made comments to Busacca in the tunnel at the end of Tuesday's match.
