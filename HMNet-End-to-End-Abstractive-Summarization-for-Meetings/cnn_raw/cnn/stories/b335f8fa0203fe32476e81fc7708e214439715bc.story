(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has added to his tournament workload as he bids to return to winning ways in the majors this season.

The 36-year-old American is stalled on 14 major titles -- four short of the all-time record held by Jack Nicklaus -- since his U.S. Open triumph in 2008.

His career has been interrupted by injury and well publicized problems in his personal life, but this year Woods returned to top form with victory in the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill.

But disappointing showings at Quail Hollow, where he missed the cut, and the U.S. Masters and Players Championship have taken the shine off that win as he heads into the big tournaments this summer.

Woods announced on his official website that he will play in the Greenbrier Classic for the first time before heading for the British Open at Royal Lytham in July.

His arch-rival Phil Mickelson will also tee it up on the Old White TPC course which saw Australian Stuart Appleby shoot a remarkable 59 in 2010 to win the tournament.

Woods, who has won 72 times on the PGA Tour, has previously built his preparation for majors around a restricted schedule of select tournaments, but earlier this season he sprang another surprise by playing in the Honda Classic for the first time since his teenage years.

"I'm excited about my schedule and looking forward to competing," said Woods, who will next head for the Memorial Tournament, hosted by Jack Nicklaus, which starts on May 31.

It will act as a tuneup for the second major of the season in the U.S. Open on the Olympic Course in San Francisco.

His preparation events for the British Open will be the AT&T National at Congressional before heading to the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia.
