Comedian Chris Tucker's multimillion dollar tax bill isn't very funny, but he's reached a deal with the IRS to settle it, his representative said Monday.

The federal tax collector placed a $2.5 million lien against Tucker in Georgia last week, but it was just a "technical requirement" before a settlement could become official, Tucker's representative said.

"Chris Tucker has not incurred any new tax years," the representative said. "The current lien filing by the IRS was the result of an audit that lasted for four years which stemmed from poor accounting and business management."

"Representatives for Mr. Tucker reached a resolution with the IRS on Friday, and his case has been settled," the representative said.

A TMZ report that Tucker owed $14 million to the IRS was inaccurate, the rep said.
