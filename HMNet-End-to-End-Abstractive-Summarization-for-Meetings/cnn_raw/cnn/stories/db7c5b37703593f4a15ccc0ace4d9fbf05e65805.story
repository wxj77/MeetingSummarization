New York (CNN) -- A  free concert in Manhattan by Canadian  rapper Drake and pop trio Hanson was canceled Tuesday evening because of an unruly crowd, police said.

"People were throwing bottles, there  was people on roofs throwing chairs. It was chaos," one concertgoer told CNN-affiliate NY1.

One  third of Hanson, Zac, talked about the incident on his offical Twitter account: "Had to cancel the free NYC show  today because of a crazy audience that was breaking things at the mixing  board."

The  mayhem erupted before Drake, whose widely anticipated new album hit stores  Tuesday, took the stage. "NYPD will not let me go on stage tonight," he tweeted  shortly before he was supposed to perform.

A  spokeswoman for the NYPD disputed the idea that police called off the concert,  telling CNN that the event's promoters made that call.

Paper Magazine, a sponsor of the  event along with Ray-Ban, explained via Twitter that "the crowd was much larger  than we anticipated."

A promotional poster said organizers were expecting a  crowd of 10,000-plus.

Two  concertgoers were arrested and some others sustained "minor injuries,"  the NYPD spokeswoman said.
