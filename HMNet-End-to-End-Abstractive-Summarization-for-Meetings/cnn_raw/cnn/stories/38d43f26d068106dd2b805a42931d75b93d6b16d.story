(CNN) -- Even if you didn't watch the Golden Globes, you might have caught the highlights and low points from Twitter's armchair critics. Amid the chatter about dresses, 'dos and the long path to the stage, some viewers used Twitter to call out examples of sexism and the lack of diversity surrounding the awards.

While there was much love for hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, discussion of gender inequality and racial disparities among nominees and winners coursed throughout the Twitterverse. Some of the conversation was stoked by the Representation Project, a nonprofit that challenges gender stereotypes in the media. The group urged viewers to use the hashtag #NotBuyingIt to cite examples of racism and sexism during the show and in commercials.

Here's a sampling of those comments:
