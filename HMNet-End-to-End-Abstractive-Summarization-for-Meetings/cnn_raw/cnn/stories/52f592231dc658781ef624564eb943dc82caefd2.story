Love may be in the air this Valentine's Day, but many people in the U.S. Northeast won't be stepping outside. Today, we'll look at what could be the worst storm they've faced this winter. We also cover a giant telecommunications deal, a lawsuit involving the president, and a look at some very happy homecomings.

Please note there will be no show on Monday's Presidents Day holiday. The daily program will resume Tuesday, February 18.
