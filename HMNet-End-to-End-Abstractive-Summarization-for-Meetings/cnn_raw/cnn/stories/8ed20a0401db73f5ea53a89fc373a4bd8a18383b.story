(CNN) -- France and Britain plan to abstain from a Security Council vote on the Palestinians' bid for statehood, two U.N. diplomats said Thursday.

France told members of the U.N. Security Council about its intentions at a Thursday afternoon meeting of the admissions committee for new U.N. membership, a Security Council diplomat told CNN.

Another U.N. diplomat told CNN that Britain will also abstain, with one of its representatives likewise announcing its intentions at the same closed-door meeting.

The U.N. Security Council is set to meet November 11 to discuss a report about whether or not to admit a Palestinian state as a member of the international organization. The membership bid has been controversial, with Israel among those opposed.

Diplomats have said it appears unlikely the Palestinians will succeed in their bid, given that the United States -- one of five permanent security council members -- has warned it will veto the attempt.

However, a veto may not be necessary if a minimum of nine nations -- out of 15 on the U.N. council -- don't support the Palestinians' bid.
