LONDON, England (CNN)   -- Liverpool and England midfielder Steven Gerrard has denied assaulting a man during a nightclub brawl last month, a court in Southport, northern England, heard on Friday.

Gerrard leaves court on Friday after pleading not guilty to actual bodily harm and affray.

Gerrard, 28, issued a not guilty plea to affray and assaulting company director Marcus McGee, 34, at the Lounge Inn, Southport, after Gerrard scored twice in Liverpool's 5-1 win at Newcastle, reported the UK's Press Association.

The Liverpool captain was charged with occasioning actual bodily harm and affray along with co-defendants John Doran, 29, and Ian Smith, 19.

Dozens of photographers were kept back from the magistrates' court entrance in a penned area as Gerrard arrived in a dark blue suit.

Nick Evans, prosecuting, asked for the case to be heard next on April 3 after a 10-week break to prepare it.

But after submissions from the defense solicitors including Gerrard's, Richard Green, the magistrates adjourned the case back to the court at Southport on March 20.

Gerrard, a father of two young daughters, spoke only to confirm his name and address and say he intended to plead not guilty along with the other defendants.
