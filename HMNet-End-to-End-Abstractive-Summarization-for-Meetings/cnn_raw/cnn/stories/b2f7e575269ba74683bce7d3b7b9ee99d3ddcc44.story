(CNN) -- Authorities in San Francisco are asking for help from anybody who witnessed a recent fatal stabbing of a Dodgers fan after a man once suspected in the case was released.

The fatal slashing occurred Wednesday night and some have said it stemmed from the long-standing baseball rivalry between fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants.

The incident occurred after the Dodgers and Giants played and a man wearing Dodgers gear was killed just blocks from the San Francisco stadium.

The victim was Jonathan Denver, 24, the son of a Dodgers security guard. A day after the stabbing, police arrested a 21-year-old man and said he faced a homicide charge.

But Friday night that man was released from jail, CNN affiliate KGO reported.

The San Francisco District Attorney's Office released a statement about the case asking for witnesses to come forward.

"In California, it is the People's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in lawful self-defense," the statement said. "We are also asking for the public's help. If anyone witnessed the incident or has video, please contact the SFPD."

The killing shocked many.

"The fact that anybody got into any sort of beef over the Giants and the Dodgers and somebody lost their life," San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr said earlier this week. "It's just senseless."

In a prepared statement, the Giants called the incident "horrific." The club held a moment of silence for Denver before a Thursday night game, and police bulked up security.

A Dodgers statement said "the pain that this has caused his family and friends is unimaginable."
