(CNN)  -- Real Madrid saw off city rivals Atletico Madrid 2-0 on Sunday night to maintain their leadership of Spain's La Liga.

First half goals from Ricardo Carvalho and Mesut Ozil within the space of six minutes settled an incident-packed derby in which both sides carved out a string of chances.

It left Real a point clear of champions Barcelona, who beat Getafe 3-1 in an earlier kickoff in which both teams ended with 10 men.

Former Chelsea defender Carvalho took advantage of a deflected pass to run through to score the Real opener while German international midfielder Ozil scored direct from a free kick.

Barcelona kept the pressure on with a display of superb attacking football with Lionel Messi putting them ahead midway through the first half after a fine pass from David Villa.

Villa added the second before halftime and it was 3-0 after the break as Messi set up Pedro Rodriguez.

Manu del Moral pulled a goal back from the penalty spot after Barca's Gerard Pique handled in the penalty area and was sent off for his second bookable offence.

Getafe later had Derek Boateng sent off for a second yellow card.

Third-placed Villarreal kept up their title challenge with a 4-1 home win over Athletic Bilbao to maintain their 100 per cent home record.

Villarreal fell behind when Fernando Llorente headed home but Nilmar quickly equalized.

Santi Cazorla put Villarreal ahead before halftime and with Athletic down to 10 men after Jon Aurtenetxe was shown red, Guiseppe Rossi added a third and Jefferson Montero completed the scoring.
