(CNN) -- The drama of the action in-and-around the golf course has enraptured fans of the game through the generations and around the world. But the same drama that pulls in the crowds has also provided rich material for filmmakers too.

Stars of the screen including Dean Martin, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy have all starred in club-themed movies, as have more contemporary celebrities like Adam Sandler, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase and Will Smith.

Though the stories committed to celluloid vary in their approach - from The Stooges comedic farce entitled "Three Little Beers," to the Ben Hogan biopic "Follow the Sun,"  - the central attraction of golf remains at all the film's core.

Here is CNN's best ten golf movies ever made - do you agree with our selection? If there is another film you feel should be included then add your comments to the Sound Off below.
