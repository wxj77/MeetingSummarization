(CNN Student News) -- November 25, 2013

A preliminary agreement involving Iran's controversial nuclear program could signal the end of decades of diplomatic gridlock. On Monday, CNN Student News reports on the details of the deal and some vastly different reactions to it. We also discuss the potential impact of winter weather on Thanksgiving travel. And we meet a teen who's planning for an upcoming hospital stay by thinking of her fellow patients.
