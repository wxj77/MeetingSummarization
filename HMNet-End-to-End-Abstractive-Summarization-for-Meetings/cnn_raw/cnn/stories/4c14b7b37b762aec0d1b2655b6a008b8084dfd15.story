Kasakakairu, Kenya (CNN) -- Men armed with guns and machetes attacked residents of a Kenyan village before dawn Tuesday, killing at least five people, witnesses told CNN.

The attackers went house to house targeting residents in the village of Kasakakairu, the witnesses said.

Six people have been admitted to a local hospital with serious injuries, and police are checking the area for more victims.

Kasakakairu is approximately 34 kilometers (21 miles) from Mpeketoni, a southeastern Kenyan coastal town where a terrorist attack killed dozens of people earlier this month.

Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said last week that Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group active in Somalia, wasn't responsible for the Mpeketoni attack.

Instead, he blamed local political networks for the attack that witnesses said turned a World Cup viewing party into a bloodbath.

Armed men stormed the city center, shooting and hacking people to death before moving into a residential area, where they went from door to door, the witnesses said.

Journalist Athman Omar reported from Kasakakairu, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.
