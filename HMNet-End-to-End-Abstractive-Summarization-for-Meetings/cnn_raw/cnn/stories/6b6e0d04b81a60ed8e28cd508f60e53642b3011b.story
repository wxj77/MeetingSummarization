(CNN) -- Barcelona continued their storming start to the La Liga season with a fifth straight win but it needed two late goals to secure a 2-0 victory over Granada in the Camp Nou Saturday.

The visitors looked set to share the points with the Catalan giants until a brilliant 87th minute strike from substitute Xavi Hernandez broke the deadlock.

The midfield ace bent home a shot from outside the area via the underside of the crossbar.

Borja Gomez put through his own net in injury time from Lionel Messi's cross to add gloss to the scoreline for Tito Vilanova's men.

Granada keeper Tono had been in inspired form to deny the home side, who have built an 11 point lead over reigning champions Real Madrid.

Real Madrid visit Rayo Vallecano Sunday night looking for a win to cut the gap.

Earlier, Junior Paulao scored as Real Betis moved up to third with a 1-0 win over Espanyol, who had midfielder Wakaso Mubarak sent off for a second yellow card in the second half.

In Italy's Serie A, defending champions Juventus maintained their 100 per cent start to the season with a 2-0 win over Chievo.

Fabio Quagliarella scored both goals in the second half as Juve made it for wins from four.

Quagliarella had grabbed the equalizer for his side in the 2-2 draw at defending champions Chelsea in the Champions League in midweek.
