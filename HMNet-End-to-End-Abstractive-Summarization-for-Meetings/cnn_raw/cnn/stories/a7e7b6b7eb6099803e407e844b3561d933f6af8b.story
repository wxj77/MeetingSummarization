Catwalk king Tom Ford gives Art of Life exclusive access to his work and life

Ford on fashion

For many, Tom Ford's vision of accessible luxury at Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent in the 90s epitomised the glamour of that decade. His latest label Tom Ford Menswear is infused with the kind of elegance he is known for and aims to revolutionise the notion of luxury he created. In Milan, he talks about why he won't be offering a catwalk collection and shares his plans for the future in New York.

The man behind the brand

He is one of the most talked about designers in the world but who is the real Tom Ford? Monita Rajpal gets personal with the designer considered by some to be the consummate showman but who confesses to being shy. He explains how his intuition got him where he is today and lets slip a few revelations from the past.

Tom's London

Tom Ford splits his time between his homes in LA, Santa Fe, Austin, Texas and London. He has a particular affection for London and gives Monita Rajpal a tour of his home before having a bite to eat at Scott's, Mayfair and indulging in some art appreciation at the White Cube gallery.
