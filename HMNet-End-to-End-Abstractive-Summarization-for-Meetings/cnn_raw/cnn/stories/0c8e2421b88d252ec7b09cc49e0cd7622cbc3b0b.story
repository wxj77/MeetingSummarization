(CNN) -- Will there be a second act?

Theo Kingma, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, said he hopes Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, the popular co-hosts of this year's Golden Globes, will return.

However, representatives for the association, which hosts the event, declined to comment on whether the women have been approached or asked.

The 71st Golden Globe awards ceremony is scheduled for Sunday, January 14.

A representative for Poehler had no comment.

From their laugh-out-loud opening quips to their improvised comebacks, old friends and "Saturday Night Live" alums Fey and Poehler got rave reviews for this year's performance in January.

Right at the onset, Poehler -- the star of "Parks and Recreation" -- assured the audience that there would only be good-natured jokes during the broadcast, because as the more biting Ricky Gervais has shown, "when you run afoul of the Hollywood Foreign Press, they make you host the show two more times."

Among their greatest hits:

• "When it comes to torture, I trust the lady who spent three years married to James Cameron." -- Poehler, referring to Kathryn Bigelow, the director of the movie "Zero Dark Thirty," which stirred controversy over its portrayal of the torture of terror detainees.

• "I have not seen someone so totally alone and abandoned like that since you were on stage with James Franco at the Oscars." -- Fey to Anne Hathaway about the latter's performance in "Les Miserables."

• Their heckling, with liquor tumblers in hand, of Lena Dunham, who beat them for the best TV comedy actress award.

• Introducing George Clooney: "This next presenter is so handsome, he makes young George Clooney look like garbage. Please welcome middle-aged George Clooney."
