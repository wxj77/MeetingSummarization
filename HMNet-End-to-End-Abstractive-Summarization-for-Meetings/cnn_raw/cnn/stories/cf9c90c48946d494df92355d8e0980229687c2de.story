(CNN) -- A goal from striker David Villa handed Spanish champions Barcelona a deserved 1-0 victory against Sporting Gijon.

Villa struck four minutes after halftime from a tight angle inside the box after a ball from Brazilian full back Dani Alves.

Barcelona's win takes them to within one point of Real Madrid at the top of the La Liga table. Jose Mourinho's side are level on ten points with Valencia, who drew 1-1 with Atletico Madrid thanks to a late Aritz Aduriz strike.

Elsewhere, Sergio's goal was enough for Levante to claim three points at Almeria while Real Zaragoza and Hercules drew 0-0.
