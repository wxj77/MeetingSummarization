A Ukrainian cargo plane crashed shortly after takeoff in mountainous southeastern Algeria on Saturday morning, killing seven people who were aboard, Algerian state-run news agency Algerie Presse Service reported.

The Ukraine Air Alliance plane crashed about three minutes after it took off from Algeria's Tamanrasset airport, APS reported.

Rescuers reached the crash site about 15 kilometers south of the airport but found no survivors, the news service reported, citing the country's transportation ministry.

The Tamanrasset prosecutor visited the scene of the crash and has ordered police to conduct an investigation, according to APS.

The Russian-built Antonov An-12 plane was carrying oil equipment, headed from Glasgow, Scotland, to Equatorial Guinea; Tamanrasset was one of its stopovers, APS reported.

No cause of the crash has been announced.
