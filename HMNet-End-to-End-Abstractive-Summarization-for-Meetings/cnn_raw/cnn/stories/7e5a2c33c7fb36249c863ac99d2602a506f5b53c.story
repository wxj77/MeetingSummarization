London (CNN) -- Prince Harry has become the latest member of the British royal family to join Twitter.

The prince sent a message from London's BT Tower Thursday to mark tickets going on sale for the Invictus Games, which he champions.

The international competition, which was launched by Harry in March this year, organizes special sporting events for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women.

Tweeting from the Invictus Games account, the prince said: "Hope everyone will get behind #invictusgames. Great opportunity to support and thank the men and women who have given so much. Harry."

Harry then joined a Twitter Q&A with Daniel Whittingham and Andy Phillips, who hope to take part in the competition as part of the British Armed Forces Team.

Whittingham said "During rehab, sport plays a key part in every soldier's recovery. Put them in a wheelchair, on a sitting volleyball court or in a pool and you will see a fire rekindled in their eyes. I'm really excited about potentially being a part of the Invictus Games and prove I am unconquered by my injury."

Although he is yet to create his own account, Harry joins a number of royals with a presence on Twitter, including Prince Andrew (@TheDukeofYork), the Queen (represented by @BritishMonarchy), and Prince Charles, who tweets from the handle @ClarenceHouse.

The Invictus Games will take place in September this year, in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London, which was built for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Tickets go on sale at 9am GMT on Friday 16 May and the full schedule can be found on the Invictus Games website.
