(CNN) -- A Massachusetts man taken into custody in a law enforcement sweep after the Times Square bombing attempt last year was deported to Pakistan Saturday, Customs officials said Sunday.

Aftab Ali, also known as Aftab Khan, pleaded guilty to charges of unlicensed money transmitting and immigration document fraud in a plea deal that included his deportation, a statement from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said.

Khan, 28, was one of the men picked up in a terror sweep a year ago after the botched May 1, 2010, car bomb attempt.

"Investigators obtained evidence that Khan had provided $4,900 to Faisal Shahzad, who was later convicted of carrying out the bombing attempt," ICE said.

"Khan borrowed the money and transferred it to Shahzad in February 2010 as part of a 'hawala' transaction in which Khan's family received an equivalent amount of money in Pakistan," the statement said.

The federal complaint against Khan did not charge that he was complicit in the attempted bombing or that he knew what Shahzad intended to do with the money, ICE said.

ICE agents accompanied Khan, who lived in Watertown, Massachusetts, on a flight from Boston to Islamabad, Pakistan, Saturday, the agency said.

Khan, 28, had been in federal custody since May 2010, when he, his uncle, and a man in Maine were arrested.
