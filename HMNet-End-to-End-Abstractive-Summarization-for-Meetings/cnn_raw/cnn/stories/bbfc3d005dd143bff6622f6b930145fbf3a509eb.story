(CNN) -- The Amanda Bynes saga continues.

Early on Saturday, TMZ posted audio purporting to be of Bynes saying she wanted to murder her father.

In the tape, she is heard telling someone that she wants her family dead because they control her money.

On Sunday, the actress released a statement to "Access Hollywood" seeming to apologize for what she said on the recording and trusting the people who recorded her.

"I'm sorry I trusted people who clearly were not my friends and capitalized on my illness," she said. "I am doing my best to get better. I am truly sorry for the statements I made. I am sorry for any pain I caused my family and others."

The statement went on: "I am thankful for everyone's patience and understanding. I never expected others to take advantage and profit from my condition. I'm disappointed with those who lulled me into a false sense of security only to find out they really are only interested in selling my privacy to the media."

CNN has not independently verified the TMZ recording was of Bynes.

Earlier, Bynes tweeted that she was joking about wanting to kill her father. "I straight up don't believe in harming a soul," she posted.

This is the latest kerfuffle involving the 28-year-old Bynes after someone tweeted from her Twitter account that she was bipolar in October. She later blamed a "friend" for tweeting that out.
