December 12, 2013

On Thursday, CNN Student News gives viewers a ground-level view of the tension on the streets of Ukraine's capital, and we explain why many Ukrainians are not protesting. After following up on some recent stories, we reveal the 2013 TIME Person of the Year, and we discuss why some people preferred the runner-up. Plus, we meet a young entrepreneur and a homeless man who teamed up to develop an environmental app.
