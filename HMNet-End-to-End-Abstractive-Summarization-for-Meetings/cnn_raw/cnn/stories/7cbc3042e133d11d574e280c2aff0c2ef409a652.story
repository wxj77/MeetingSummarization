(CNN) -- No wonder Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher were so affectionate at a recent Clippers game: The couple are reportedly expecting a baby.

"They are both very, very happy," a friend of theirs tells People magazine. "It's still early."

Kunis, 30, and Kutcher, 36, are also said to be engaged.

Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher: A love story

Reps for the stars haven't commented on the engagement or baby reports, but the actors have made no attempts at hiding their status. At the Clippers game Saturday in Los Angeles, Kunis' large diamond was in full view for all to see -- especially once the couple were caught on the kiss cam.

The former "That '70s Show" co-stars were sitting courtside when the cameras panned down to their choice seats, and a bashful Kunis initially didn't know how to react.

But after Kutcher moved his cap and leaned in for a kiss, Kunis obliged, much to the amusement of the cheering crowd.

The couple might soon lock lips on camera once again when Kunis guest stars on Kutcher's CBS comedy, "Two and a Half Men." In an upcoming episode, Kunis will portray Vivian, a beautiful free spirit who catches the eye of Kutcher's character, Walden, right before he's supposed to propose to another woman.
