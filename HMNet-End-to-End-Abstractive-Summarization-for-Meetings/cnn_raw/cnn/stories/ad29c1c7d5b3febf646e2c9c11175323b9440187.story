(CNN) -- First-term Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk said "no frickin' way am I retiring" in an interview with Roll Call published Friday morning, instead clearly signaling his intentions to run for reelection in 2016.

His statement comes amid speculation that his health and staff turnover might cause him to step down after his first term. His chief of staff Erik Elk has said he will join the private sector, while other top staffers have joined newly elected GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner's team. And a debilitating stroke in 2012 has caused the senator to occasionally rely on a wheelchair.

"With all this rehab, for me just to walk was a huge effort," Kirk told Roll Call. "I had to re-learn how to walk again after the stroke. And all the rehab and all the effort shows the mental determination times 10 to keep serving."

But Kirk also said that attacks from the left highlighting his previous health problems might actually help his campaign efforts.

"That would not be taken well by the people of Illinois who would not like that kind of attack," he said. "It's the only way that Democrats can win in Illinois, is to say, 'Oh, Kirk has health problems, he's going to retire.'"

Illinois, typically a deep blue state, will likely be a top target for Democrats in 2016 looking to regain Senate seats after suffering big losses across the country earlier this month.

The Chicago Sun-Times reports that his campaign fund raised more than $2 million since 2013.
