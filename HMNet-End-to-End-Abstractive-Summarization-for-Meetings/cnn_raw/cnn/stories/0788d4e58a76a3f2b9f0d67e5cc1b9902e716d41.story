(CNN)Dolce & Gabbana went familial for fall at its fashion show in Milan on Sunday, dedicating its collection to "mamma" with nary a pair of "mom jeans" in sight.

Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, who are behind the Italian brand, sent models down the runway in decidedly feminine dresses and skirts adorned with roses, lace and even embroidered doodles by the designers' own nieces and nephews.

Many of the looks featured saccharine needlework phrases like "I love you, mamma" and "Per la mamma pi√π bella del mondo" (for the most beautiful mother in the world) as a tableau vivant of moms and daughters stood and posed as a backdrop for the runway.

Even the usually stoic-faced front row couldn't help but applaud and smile as a few models carried their own high-fashion progeny down the runway.
