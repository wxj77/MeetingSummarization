(EW.com) -- Are the Big Pink young enough to have grown up on their parents' Jesus and Mary Chain records?

Sure sounds like it on "Future This."

The U.K. duo's latest, produced by indie kingmaker Paul Epworth (Adele), updates the best of '80s shoegaze with breakbeat rhythms and arena-worthy choruses.

On the title track, frontman Robbie Furze finds love washing over him ''in a soft explosion.''

Which isn't a bad way to describe getting swept up in their massive pop hooks.
