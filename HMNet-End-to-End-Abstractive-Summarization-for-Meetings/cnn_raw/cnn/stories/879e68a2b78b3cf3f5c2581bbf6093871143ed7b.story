LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Alex Trebek, the long-time host of the popular television quiz show "Jeopardy," suffered a minor heart attack at his home Monday night.

Alex Trebek has hosted "Jeopardy!" for 23 years.

Trebek, 67, was recovering at a local hospital, and it was not clear when he would be released, a representative of the show said. He is expected to resume taping the show in January.

The representative added that Trebek did not have any previous known condition that would have led to the heart attack.

Trebek, 67, is a native of Sudbury, Ontario. He has hosted "Jeopardy!" since 1984.

Prior to becoming "Jeopardy!" host, he served as emcee for a number of game shows, including "High Rollers," "The Wizard of Odds" and "Battlestars." E-mail to a friend
