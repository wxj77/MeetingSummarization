Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba on Thursday denounced the U.S. decision to again include the island nation on its list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Earlier in the day, the U.S. State Department in its annual report on terrorism named four countries on its 2009 list: Iran, Sudan, Syria and Cuba.

"We categorically reject the decision," said Josefina Vidal, the head of the North America Department at Cuba's Foreign Ministry.

"Yet again, the United States questions the seriousness of our commitment to the fight against international terrorism and maintains one of the most irrational aspects that constitute its hostile policy on Cuba," she said in a statement.

The State Department accused Cuba of assisting members of Colombian rebel groups and Spain's ETA, who live on the island.
