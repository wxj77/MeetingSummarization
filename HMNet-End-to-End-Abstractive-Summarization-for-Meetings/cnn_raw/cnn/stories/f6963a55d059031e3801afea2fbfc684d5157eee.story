(CNN) -- Samuel Eto'o has edged towards a move away from Inter Milan, after it was announced that a deal has been agreed to sell the Cameroon striker to Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala.

Eto'o, 30, will undergo a medical with Anzhi on Wednesday before putting pen-to-paper on a three-year contract.

"An agreement was reached today between the two football clubs regarding the transition of the forward Samuel Eto'o's to the Makhachkala club," read a statement on Anzhi's official web site.

"Both sides are completely satisfied about the financial terms of the transfer. Anzhi expresses gratitude to the leadership of Inter for its professional and constructive approach in the negotiations.

Why are Spanish footballers on strike?

"Tomorrow the player will undergo a medical, following which a three-year contract with him will be concluded.

"On Thursday, Samuel will arrive to the base of his new team, and will begin preparations for the game against FC Rostov."

Former Barcelona forward Eto'o is set to become the latest star name to join Dagestan-based Anzhi, who have already signed winger Yuri Zhirkov from Chelsea and attacking midfielder Balazs Dzsudzsak from PSV Eindhoven during this transfer window.

Anzhi also secured the signature of Brazilian World Cup winner and former Real Madrid left-back Roberto Carlos in February.

Eto'o, a four-time African Player of the Year, rose to prominence during a four-year spell with Spanish side Mallorca, before joing Catalan giants Barcelona in 2004.

Eto'o won multiple honors during his stay at the Nou Camp, including three Spanish Primera Liga titles and two European Champions League triumphs.

Inter signed Eto'o in 2009, with Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic moving in the opposite direction, and he helped the Nerazzurri claim Italian Serie A and  Champions League glory in 2010.
