(CNN) -- A CNN Hero's journey to global recognition begins with a nomination by someone who's been touched by their efforts -- someone like you who wants us to share their story with the world.

History has shown that great things can happen to those selected as CNN Heroes:

• Andrea Ivory has nearly doubled the amount of free mammograms she's offered to underserved women in South Florida.

• Doc Hendley, of Boone, North Carolina, expanded his sustainable clean-water systems on three continents as well as earthquake-ravaged Haiti.

• Dan Wallrath, of Houston, Texas, and his organization, Operation Finally Home, doubled the number of homes they've built for injured veterans.

• Anne Mahlum expanded her Philadelphia running program for the homeless into eight cities across the country.

• Jordan Thomas of Chattanooga, Tennessee, has delivered prosthetic limbs to children in three countries.

Do you know an everyday person changing the world? It's easy to nominate them as a CNN Hero. Here are some suggestions we hope will help you in crafting your nomination.

• Think about what makes your hero special. Ask yourself: What makes my nominee unique? What specific accomplishment has he or she achieved that is truly remarkable? What impact has their work had on others? We encourage you to watch videos of previous CNN Heroes to familiarize yourself with the achievements of the inspiring individuals we honor as "everyday people changing the world."

• Take a look at our nomination form. We suggest you review the information requested about yourself, your nominee and their work before filling out your submission.

• Tell us about your hero! Take your time and write from the heart. Remember: What you share -- in your own words -- is the most important factor in advancing a nomination for further consideration. You can enter your answers to the essay questions directly on the form, or write them first in a word-processing document and "cut-and-paste" them into each answer field. Please note that the information you provide will be used in accordance with our privacy policy.

• Click "Submit." If your nomination has been successfully transmitted, you'll see a "thank you" message on your screen. If you provided us with your e-mail address, we'll also send a confirmation that your nomination has been received. And yes, we read each and every one.

That's it! Nominations for 2012 CNN Heroes remain open through August 31, 2012.

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Who is eligible to be considered as a CNN Hero?

A: Nominations must be in the name of a single individual, at least 13 years of age, whose accomplishment occurred (or continued) after September 1, 2011. Nominees in the "Young Wonder" category must be 25 years of age or younger. Groups and organizations are ineligible for consideration. Self-nominations will not be accepted. Citizens of voided countries are also ineligible. For complete details on eligibility requirements and other rules governing selection of CNN Heroes, please read our Legal Disclosures.

Q: How will I know if my hero is selected?

A: Because of the high volume of nominations received, we cannot respond individually to each submission. However, if your nomination advances, we will contact you and your nominee through the contact information you provide.

Q: What if I don't know my nominee's address, e-mail, and telephone number?

A: Please make every effort to provide as much contact information as possible. We require either an email address or telephone number so we may quickly contact your nominee to obtain their permission for consideration as a CNN Hero.

Q: May I submit additional supportive information about my nominee?

A: There's space at the end of the form to provide links to articles or Web sites with more information about your hero. Please do not send additional materials unless requested.

Q: May I mail or fax my nomination?

A: No. All nominations must be submitted online through our Web site.

Q: What if my nomination form is rejected?

A: When filling out your form, please note that certain information is required. Those fields are marked with an asterisk (*). If you are not certain of your hero's nationality, select "Other" from the country drop-down menu. Likewise, if you're unsure which category their cause belongs in, just click "Other."

CNN is not responsible for technical problems that may prevent your submission from being successfully transmitted. You may wish to first write and save the answers to essay questions in a word-processing document. That way, if you need to re-submit your nomination, you can "cut-and-paste" those answers into the form without re-writing them.

Q: Can I buy tickets to "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"?

A: Unfortunately, seating is limited and by invitation only. Airdates and times for the global broadcast of "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute" will be announced later this year.
