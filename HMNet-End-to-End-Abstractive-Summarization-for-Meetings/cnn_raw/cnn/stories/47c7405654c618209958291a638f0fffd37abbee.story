(CNN)  -- Nikolay Davydenko made a winning start in his defense of the Qatar Open title with a 6-1 6-4 victory over Italy's Fabio Fognini on Monday.

Davydenko is fourth seed at prestigious ATP Tour season-opener where the star attractions are the world's top two players Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, who begin their campaigns later in the week.

The Russian, hoping to return to top form after injury blighted his 2010 season, needed just over an hour to dispatch Fognini.

He beat two-time Doha champion Federer and Spain's Nadal on the way to the title last season.

But the statistics point to a Federer or Nadal triumph come Saturday. They have been the top two seeds in 66 tournaments, with one or other going on to win the title on 44 occasions.

Third seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was also a straight sets winner on his debut at the $1.024 million tournament.

The Frenchman blasted 10 aces as he breezed past Ruben Ramirez Hidalgo 6-2 6-0.

Tsonga only dropped eight points on service and converted five of nine break point opportunities to open his 2011 account in some style.

Seventh seed Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain began proceedings with a 6-1 7-6 win over Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan in just over 90 minutes.

In the Chennai Open, there was a shock defeat for reigning champion Marin Cilic of Croatia.

Cilic was upset by Japan's Kei Nishikori 4-6 7-6 6-2 in the first round as he bid for a hat-trick of titles at the Indian tournament.
