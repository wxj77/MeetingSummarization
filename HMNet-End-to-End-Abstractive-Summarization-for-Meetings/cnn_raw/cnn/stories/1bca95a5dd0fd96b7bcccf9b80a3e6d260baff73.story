Zombies, "World of Warcraft" characters and showgirls in skimpy outfits flooded Shanghai's New International Expo Centre from July 31-August 3 for the 12th annual ChinaJoy event.

One of the highlights of the meet -- its annual cosplay competition.

Participants, either solo or in teams, dressed up to emulate characters from comic books, movies and video games to be judged based on their costumes, routine and the  response they received from the audience.

With some preparing months in advance, the show was spectacular. Click through the gallery above for some of the results.
