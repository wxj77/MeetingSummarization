Get ready to meet the new classics of children's literature.

Children's and young adult books are sporting some shiny new seals after the American Library Association announced its most esteemed literary prizes Monday, including the Newbery and Caldecott medals.

The Caldecott Medal went to "Locomotive," written and illustrated by Brian Floca. The book follows family and crew traveling together on America's new transcontinental railroad in the summer of 1869.

The Newbery Medal was awarded to "Flora & Ulysses: The Illuminated Adventures," written by Kate DiCamillo, who also wrote "Because of Winn-Dixie" and "The Tale of Despereaux," and illustrated by K.G. Campbell. It's the story of a young comic book enthusiast and cynic, Flora, and a superhero squirrel named Ulysses who helps Flora against her greatest enemy.

The awards announced Monday recognize children's and young adult authors, illustrators and media producers. The winning list guides parents, teachers and libraries, and the books typically remain in print and on store and library shelves for years to come.

The ALA Youth Media Awards were announced during the organization's winter meeting in Philadelphia and selected by a national judging committee of librarians and children's literature experts.
