(CNN) -- Lifetime will premiere an hour-long documentary that pays tribute to Cher's mom Georgia Holt on May 6.

"Dear Mom, Love Cher" will focus on the singer's family history and features interviews with Holt, her daughters Cher and Georganne LaPiere Bartylak, and grandchildren Chaz Bono and Elijah Blue Allman.

The documentary will begin with Holt's childhood in rural Arkansas and chronicle her six "tumultuous" marriages while she helped Cher to pursue a career.

"This project started as a gift for my mom's 86th birthday. Like most things in my family, it was initiated by my sister Georganne, who asked me if I could update mom's album," said Cher in a statement. So I went big ... I'm known in the family for doing that. My sister and I are proud of our mom and we want to share her with the world. My mom is exactly like Rocky. She never gives up!"
