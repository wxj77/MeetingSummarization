(CNN) -- Olympic snowboarding medalist Shaun White apologized Tuesday, a day after his arrest on vandalism and public intoxication charges at a hotel in Nashville.

White, 26, was arrested after trying to flee the hotel in a cab and kicking a hotel guest who tried to stop him, according to a statement Monday from the Nashville Metro Police Department.

The U.S. snowboarder, nicknamed "The Flying Tomato" for his distinctive red hair, posted an apology on his Facebook page Tuesday.

"I want to apologize for the unwise choices I made over the weekend and for any inconvenience it caused my family, friends, business partners, the hotel and their guests," White wrote. "I was celebrating a happy occasion with a ton of family and friends and got carried away. I'm truly sorry for my poor behavior."

White "appeared to be extremely intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol," and his "eyes were red and bloodshot," according to the police report.

White ran from the hotel after an employee accused him of smashing a phone, police said.

A guest followed White from the hotel and called police, the incident report said.

"Once the guest told Mr. White that he called the police, Mr. White attempted to attack the man and fell and hit his head," the report said. White was taken to a hospital to have his head injury checked, police said.

The guest didn't press charges, but White was arrested on the other misdemeanor charges after refusing to sign a citation, police said.

White was released on his own recognizance Monday evening, Davidson County sheriff's spokeswoman Melinda McDowell said.

White has been a professional snowboarder and skateboarder since his early teens, taking gold medals in the halfpipe competition at the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics.
