Dallas, Texas (CNN) -- A gunman who fired shots at a Texas police department near a college campus has been killed, the college said.

Shots were fired Tuesday at the McKinney Police Department near Collin College's Central Park Campus in McKinney, Texas, according to campus spokeswoman Lisa Vasquez.

The incident took place shortly after 9 a.m.  The gunman parked his car at the McKinney Police Department before the shooting took place, Vasquez said.

She said the shooter has been killed, but it is not known whether he was killed by police or if he killed himself.  Vasquez said it does not appear that any students, faculty, or staff were injured in the incident.

The college's emergency alert system notified students and staff immediately about the shooting and the campus was on lockdown for two hours.  Campus activities have since resumed, Vasquez said.  The city was also put on lockdown briefly.

CNN affiliate WFAA, quoting an eyewitness, reported that many shots were fired.

The witness said the shooter was in an open field, firing randomly at vehicles driving by. The eyewitness saw only one shooter and eventually police shot toward him.

Collin College is a two-year community college with an enrollment of 3,800 students.   Classes begin there on Monday.
