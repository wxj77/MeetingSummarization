(CNN) -- Hurricane Rick weakened to a Category 3 storm early Monday as it churned toward Mexico's Pacific coast, forecasters said.

Workers fill sand bags at the Pueblo Bonito Rose Hotel on Mexico's Baja Peninsula early Monday.

Rick, still a powerful storm, was expected to weaken further before landfall by midweek.

Maximum sustained winds dropped to near 115 mph (185 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, said in a 11 a.m. ET advisory.

"Although additional weakening is forecast during the next day or so, Rick is still expected to be a dangerous hurricane as it approaches the southern Baja Peninsula," forecasters said. "Interests in western Mexico, should monitor the progress of this hurricane."

Mexican officials issued a hurricane watch for southern Baja, California, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Forecasters said Rick would cause "potentially dangerous surf conditions."

Hurricane Rick was downgraded to a Category 4 storm Sunday evening.
