(CNN Student News) -- November 22, 2013

In Friday's show, CNN Student News explains the U.S. Senate's so-called "nuclear option" and what the long-term implications might be. We also report on a proposed security deal between the U.S. and Afghanistan. And on the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination, we hear how the details of that fateful day are etched in the minds of some Americans.
