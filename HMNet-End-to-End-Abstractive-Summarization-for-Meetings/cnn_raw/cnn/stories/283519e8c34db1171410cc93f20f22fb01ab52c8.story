Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Human remains found in Georgia on Saturday are being tested to see if they belong to a woman who went missing nearly a year and a half ago, a Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman said Sunday.

Passersby found human bones about nine miles from where Kristi Cornwell of Blairsville, Georgia, was last seen in August 2009, GBI spokesman John Bankhead said.

Bankhead said the results of tests on the bones will be announced Monday morning.

The site where the bones were discovered and Blairsville are both in Union County, in far northern Georgia.

"What you do first is compare people missing from Union County," Bankhead told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB. "Right now, the only person missing from Union County is Kristi Cornwell, so we'll be looking to see if there might be (a) connection to these remains."

Bankhead said that Cornwell's family has been notified of the discovery.

He said that authorities have a person of interest in Cornwell's disappearance but would not provide further details.

Last summer, on the one year anniversary of Cornwell's disappearance, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said it had conducted interviews at 450 houses in the Union County area and that its file on the case had grown to 38 volumes.

CNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report.
