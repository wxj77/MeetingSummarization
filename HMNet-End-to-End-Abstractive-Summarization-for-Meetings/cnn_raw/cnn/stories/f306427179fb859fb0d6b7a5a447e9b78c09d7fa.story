(CNN) -- Serge Betsen has told CNN he is ready to step out of international retirement and help France's charge for the Rugby World Cup in 2011.

The experienced flanker won 63 caps for his country over a ten-year period before he announced he was quitting the game in January 2008.

He was subsequently tempted out of retirement by English Premiership club London Wasps soon after and has just extended his contract at the club until next year.

Now he has told CNN that he hasn't ruled out an emotional comeback for what would be his third World Cup, under current coach Marc Lievremont.

He said: "Why not? When I see my teammates like Simon Shaw and Joe Worsley who are still playing for the England team, yes, I would like to but ask Marc Lievremont."

The 35-year-old says he has been impressed with France's Six Nations campaign in which they sealed their first Grand Slam since 2004.

He told CNN: "France started very well in the Six Nations and game after game they built a very strong team. Marc Lievremont deserves this title.

"The team for the next World Cup is ready to go to New Zealand and try to reach for the trophy."

France edged past England in the climax of their Six Nations campaign but Betsen says the World Cup would be a totally different prospect.

He should know -- Betsen's two World Cup experiences as a player ended in defeat to England. He said: "Like always at the end of a big, big meeting like the World Cup England will be there.

"That's my concern about the French team because I played twice against England for my two World Cup's and twice again I was beaten by this team. We need to be focused as a team for the next World Cup."
