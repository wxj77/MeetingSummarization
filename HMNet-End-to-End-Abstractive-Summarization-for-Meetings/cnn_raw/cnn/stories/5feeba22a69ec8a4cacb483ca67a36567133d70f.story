MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Nearly a week after dozens of inmates walked out of a prison in Zacatecas, the central Mexican state's top security official has resigned, state-run media reported Friday.

Alejandro Rojas Chalico was the Zacatecas secretary of public security. State-run Notimex reported his resignation, citing the state administration.

It was not clear if Gov. Amalia Garcia Medina had accepted Chalico's resignation, Notimex reported. No further details were available.

Mexican authorities have been trying to track down the 53 prisoners who left Cieneguillas prison in the city of Zacatecas on Saturday with the help of 20 men.

Though the men who raided the prison that morning were armed, they freed the prisoners without firing a shot, according to Medina.

The prison break took fewer than five minutes, he said. He believes the inmates are likely connected to the Gulf Cartel, a powerful drug cartel operating in northern Mexico.

The news of Chalico's resignation came as the international criminal police organization Interpol issued a security alert for 11 of the men, whom it said Mexican authorities have identified as the "most dangerous."

The alert, or "orange notice," includes identifying details of each fugitive to help law enforcement officers in their search, Interpol said.

It identified the prisoners as: Juan Enrique Almader Becerra, 21; Pablo Banuelos Esponoza, 30; Heriberto Centeno Madrid, 39; Ruben Delgado Gamillo, 28; Santiago Hernandez Naranjo, 36; Daniel Martinez Solis, 22; Joe Reyes Martinez, 33; Juan Antonio Saucedo Diaz, 33; Jesus Maria Soto Calderon, 52; Jose Florentino Soto Estrada, 30; and Erick Jesus Soto Estrada, 25.
