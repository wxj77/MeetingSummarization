(CNN) -- Barcelona defender Eric Abidal returned to training Wednesday after seven months on the sidelines following a liver transplant.

The 33-year-old was delighted to be back in action as he told the official website of the Catalan giants.

"I've been thinking about training will the ball for a long time," the 33-year-old said. "Today is the first day. I'm tired, but happy. I think from now on my path to recovery will go well."

The world of football was stunned when Abidal was diagnosed with a liver tumor in May 2011, but he made a remarkable recovery to reclaim his place in the first team squad at the Camp Nou.

But further complications arose in March which necessitated the transplant operation and another lengthy spell of rehabilitation.

Abidal, hugely popular with the Barca fans, began his career with Monaco before moving to Lille in 2002. It was after leaving Lille to join Lyon in 2004 that he rose to prominence.
