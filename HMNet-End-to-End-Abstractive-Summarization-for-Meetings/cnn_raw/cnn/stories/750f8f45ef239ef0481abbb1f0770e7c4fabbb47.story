(CNN) -- One of the men taken into custody in connection with the suspected kidnapping of a 2-year-old boy and a double homicide in Rhode Island was arraigned Monday, police said.

He is Daniel Rodriguez. The initial suspect in the case, Malcolm Crowell, has been released and there are no plans to charge him, according to Johnston Police Chief Richard Tamburini.

An Amber Alert was issued for the boy on Sunday and he was found wandering the streets of Providence. The mother and daughter, Evelyn Burgos, 40, and Vanessa Perez, 25, both were shot to death, officials said.

Police said Crowell helped police recover the boy, who Tamburini said is Burgos' son. Police now list the boy's name as Isaiah. Earlier, his first name was listed as Isaih.

The child appeared to be in good health when checked out at a hospital, Johnston Police Deputy Chief Daniel Parrillo said. "A patrolman found him while on patrol just walking on the sidewalk," he said.

Police now say Crowell, 22, was helpful in the recovery of the child.
