(CNN)Uma Thurman not only has a new project, she also has a new look.

The 44-year-old actress looked quite different when she recently walked the red carpet for the premiere of  her new NBC miniseries, "The Slap." Thurman wore minimal makeup and her blonde hair tucked behind her ears.

Her appearance set off an onslaught of comments similar to when actress Renee Zellweger raised eyebrows in October by looking little like she did during her "Bridget Jones" days.

The coverage of Thurman's new look has ranged from the Daily Mail headline "What has Uma Thurman done to her face?"  to Hollywood Life writing that the actress is now  "nearly unrecognizable."

"I know I look weird," Thurman told Savannah Guthrie of the "Today" show when asked about all the hoopla. "I don't know, I guess nobody liked my makeup."
