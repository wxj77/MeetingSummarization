Los Angeles (CNN) -- The judge overseeing Michael Jackson's estate and the custody of his children ordered an investigation into Paris Jackson's apparent suicide attempt.

Paris, 15, is in a Los Angeles hospital at least until Saturday for evaluation after an incident early Wednesday in which she cut her wrist and called a suicide counseling hot line.

"We're completely supportive of the judge's action," Perry Sanders, the lawyer for Katherine Jackson, said Friday.

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff signed the order Thursday instructing Probate Court Investigator Cary Ornelas "to prepare an investigation report addressing the status" of Paris Jackson and "recent media reports concerning her welfare."

Beckloff appointed Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, to be sole guardian of Prince, Paris and Blanket soon after the singer's sudden death on June 25, 2009. Her guardianship was briefly suspended after she disappeared and was out of communication for more than a week last summer.

The children's cousin T.J. Jackson, who was appointed guardian while the family matriarch was missing, was then made a co-guardian.

In addition to the hospitalization of Paris, the probate investigator may also be checking on T.J. Jackson's participation. A media report said he no longer lives at the Jacksons' Calabasas, California, home.

"It's absolute fiction that T.J. is an absentee guardian," Sanders said. "He's always around."
