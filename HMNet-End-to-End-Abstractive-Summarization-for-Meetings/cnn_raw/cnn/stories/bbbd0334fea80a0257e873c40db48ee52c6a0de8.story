(CNN) -- The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee is accusing Republicans of being "Paleozoic" on same-sex marriage.

"The Republicans continue to cling to this really Paleozoic commitment (to oppose same-sex marriage)... even going so far as saying we should... explore amending the Constitution to prohibit people from being able to marry who they love," Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Tuesday on MSNBC's "The Daily Rundown."

While a wave of Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama didn't start endorsing same-sex marriage until the past two years, Wasserman Schultz blasted Republicans for long being "completely out of touch with the issues that are the most important to voters right now."

Her comments came after a Supreme Court decision Monday effectively cleared the way for same-sex marriage in five states and possibly an additional six states located in the same circuit appeals courts.

What's next in the fight over same-sex marriage?

GOP's position

Republicans largely stayed quiet on the issue, though Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and some social conservative leaders expressed outrage by what they described as the courts' judicial activism.

Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was on the same MSNBC program Tuesday before Wasserman Schultz. He defended the GOP's platform defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman -- and seeks a constitutional amendment to enforce the idea.

"I'm not running from that position. That's our position on it, and it's still our position today," he said.

Will same-sex marriage become a 2014 issue?

While he understands why conservatives are outraged by the courts' action, he added, the issue is unlikely to spill over into the midterm elections next month.

"People... are right to be concerned about what's happened here, but it doesn't mean it's the issue every single morning that we're dealing with in regards to these midterms," he said.
