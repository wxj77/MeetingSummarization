Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Authorities in Northern Ireland have arrested a tenth person in connection with the death of a police officer in a car bombing last April, police said Wednesday.

A 23-year-old woman was arrested in Omagh by detectives probing the death of Constable Ronan Kerr "and associated incidents," the Police Service of Northern Ireland said.

Five men were arrested Tuesday.

Kerr died April 2 when an explosive device detonated under a car in the Highfield Close area of Omagh.  The 25-year-old had only recently joined the service, Assistant Chief Constable Drew Harris said at the time.

"Our determination to pursue every possible line of enquiry remains undiminished," Detective Superintendent Raymond Murray said Tuesday.

Of the 10 people arrested, only one has been charged in connection with the investigation -- though not with the killing.  A 33-year-old man from Omagh was charged after arms and explosives were found in Coalisland, County Tyrone.

Northern Ireland was racked by violence between pro-Irish and pro-British forces over a period of three decades. About 3,500 people were killed before a power-sharing deal known as the Good Friday Agreement was reached in 1998.

In August of that year, Omagh was the scene of the conflict's most deadly terrorist attack, in which a car bombing by the paramilitary splinter group Real IRA killed 29 people.
