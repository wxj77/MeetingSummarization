(CNN) -- Rapper Gucci Mane has been arrested -- again.

This time it's for disorderly conduct, possession of marijuana and for carrying a gun, Atlanta police said.

The arrest took place early Saturday morning on an Atlanta street after a man flagged down officers who said he was concerned about the way his friend was acting.

Officers approached the friend -- later identified as Radric Davis, which is Gucci Mane's real name -- and began speaking with him.

Mane became "increasingly agitated," police said, cursing and threatening the officers.

They took him into custody and discovered he was carrying a handgun and a small amount of marijuana.

Mane, 33, is a convicted felon, and so, cannot be in possession of a weapon.

In March, Mane was arrested for hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at an Atlanta night club. The man told police the incident occurred after he tried to strike up a conversation with the rapper.

In 2010, he was arrested in Atlanta for violating a number of traffic laws. But they were dismissed for want of prosecution.

In 2005, Mane was charged with murder in the shooting death of a man -- but the charge was later dropped because of insufficient evidence.
