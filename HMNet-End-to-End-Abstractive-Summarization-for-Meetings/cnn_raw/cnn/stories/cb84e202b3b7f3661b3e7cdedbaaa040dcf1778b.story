This will come as no surprise if you have kids, know kids or know anyone who has or knows kids.

Disney is reporting that sales of dresses based on its megahit movie "Frozen" topped 3 million in North America this year alone.

Let's say that again: More than 3 million Elsa and Anna role-play dresses were bought. In North America. Just this year.

And the holiday season isn't even here yet.

If you didn't see this coming, your head has been stuck in a snowdrift, folks.

Disney's "Frozen" is on a roll.  Like a big, giant snowball headed downhill.

"The powerful connection families around the world have with Frozen and its characters is truly a phenomenon that has only continued to grow over the last 12 months," said Paul Gainer, executive vice president of Disney Retail.

Of course, there are plenty of "Frozen" products flying off the shelves and Disney is riding the retail sled as far as it will go.

A new "Frozen" film is in the works.  The animated short "Frozen Fever" is expected to debut in the spring.

Disney is also replacing the classic Epcot ride Maelstrom with a new attraction based on the hit movie that earned about $400 million at the box office in North America.

"Let it go"? The answer from America's kids seem to be pretty clear: Nuh-uh.
