Miami (CNN) -- A fire engulfed a yacht a mile off Miami Beach on Saturday, sending a thick column of black smoke into the clear blue sky before rescue crews were able to put it out, the Coast Guard said.

Three people were aboard the 80-foot yacht Bliss when it caught fire around 10 a.m., the Coast Guard said. They all jumped into the water and were rescued with no reported injuries.

Crew members from the Coast Guard Cutter Sitkinak were about to board the yacht as part of a routine inspection when the fire broke out, the Coast Guard said. Boat crews from the Coast Guard's Miami Beach station and Miami-Dade Fire Rescue responded and extinguished the fire.

It was not immediately known what started the fire.

The yacht was partially submerged Saturday afternoon and commercial salvage was being arranged to tow it back to shore, the Coast Guard said.
