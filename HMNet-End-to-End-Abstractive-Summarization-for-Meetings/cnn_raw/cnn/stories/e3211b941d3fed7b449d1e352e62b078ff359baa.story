(CNN)You "Better Call Saul," but only if you know what you're getting into.

The premiere of the new AMC series about Saul Goodman, the frenetic attorney from "Breaking Bad," is fast approaching. It will air on February 8 following the midseason premiere of "The Walking Dead."

To get fans primed, the network unveiled a two-minute trailer, the most extensive look yet at the anticipated spinoff starring Bob Odenkirk.

The trailer shows Saul fighting for his clients using every method possible, many of which are less than effective. Others get him in a lot of trouble. It's familiar terrain to anyone who watched "Breaking Bad" and got to know Saul as Walter White's shady attorney, who aided the high school chemistry teacher's transition into a drug kingpin.

The trailer was part of AMC's day at the Television Critics Association's winter press tour. More news from the event included a premiere date of Sunday, April 5, for the final episodes of "Mad Men."
