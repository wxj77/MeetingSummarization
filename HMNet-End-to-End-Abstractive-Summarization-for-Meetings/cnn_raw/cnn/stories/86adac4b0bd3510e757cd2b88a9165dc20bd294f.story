Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Five suspects were arrested on terror-related charges, including one of Indonesia's most wanted men, Abu Tholut, Indonesian police said Tuesday.

Tholut and the others were arrested in Central Java on December 10, authorities said at a news conference Tuesday.

Tholut helped create a militant training camp in Aceh that was raided by authorities in February, said Inspector General Iskandar Hasan, a National Police spokesman. The group was allegedly training and planning attacks in Indonesia that were similar to the 2008 Mumbai, India terror attacks, in which 164 people were killed.

Tholut is a weapons expert and is a former senior leader of the terror network Jemaah Islamiyah, police said.

Tholut could also be connected to detained radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir and his organization Jama'ah Ansharut Tauhid or JAT.

Bashir has been in police detention since August and Monday police sent charges to state prosecutors accusing him of multiple terror charges including inciting others to commit crimes of terror. The charges carry the maximum penalty of death.

Bashir has denied these allegations.

Tholut served four years in jail on terrorism charges from 2003 to 2007. He got off for good behavior but police say he rejoined Indonesia's terror network after his release.

It was clear Tholut, as were other top suspects either caught or arrested in recent months, were reporting to Bashir, authorities said.
