(CNN) -- Sherri Shepherd is leaving the daytime talk show "The View," sources close to her told CNN on Thursday.

Producers and people close to Shepherd have known for months that she was ready to go, they said, adding that Shepherd kept the news quiet because she didn't want to upstage or disrupt Barbara Walters' retirement.

Co-host Walters bid farewell to "The View" last month, although she will still serve as the show's executive producer.

One of the sources close to Shepherd said staff at "The View" learned about some "abrupt" changes Thursday. The source could not say what those changes are.

Jenny McCarthy, another co-host on the show, later tweeted: "If Sherri goes... I go too."

She added: "My View will be changing too ... Thanks to everyone at the show for your dedication and an amazing year."

CNN's Breeanna Hare contributed to this report.
