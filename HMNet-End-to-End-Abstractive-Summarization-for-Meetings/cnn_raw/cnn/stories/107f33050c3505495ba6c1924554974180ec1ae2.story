A former boxer was arrested Wednesday in the 1987 murder of his manager after investigators developed a break in the case by using DNA evidence, Los Angeles police said.

A fugitive task force from the FBI joined by local police arrested Exum Speight, 50, in Los Angeles suburb of San Fernando, authorities said.

He has been charged in a warrant with one count of murder in the March 29, 1987, death of boxing manager Douglas Stumler, Los Angeles police said.

In 1996, Speight fought Wladimir Klitschko, the current heavyweight champion of the world, police said.

Speight's attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday.

Los Angeles' cold case detectives developed a break in the case after they screened potential forensic leads under a grant from National Institute of Justice's "Solving Cold Cases with DNA" program, authorities said.

"DNA evidence did play a key factor in this case getting solved," the police said in a statement.

Stumler was killed in his apartment in the west Los Angeles area and was discovered by a friend who checked on him after Stumler failed to report to his full-time job at the Los Angeles County Housing Authority, police said.

Stumler held a side job as a boxing manager and was managing Speight as one of his boxers for about two years, police said.

Stumler, a native of New Albany, Indiana, moved to Los Angeles after graduating from the University of Indiana about six years before his death, police said.

Speight is scheduled to be arraigned on Thursday.
