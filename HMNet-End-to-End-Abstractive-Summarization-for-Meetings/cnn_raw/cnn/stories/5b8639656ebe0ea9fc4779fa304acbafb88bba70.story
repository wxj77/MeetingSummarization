(CNN) -- Federal officials are investigating a "potential conflict" between two planes at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, which happened shortly after Vice President Joe Biden's plane landed.

"It has nothing to do with Biden's plane," a Federal Aviation Administration official said.

An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board will look into the incident Monday morning between an ExpressJet plane taking off from one runway, while a SkyWest jet was preparing to land on an intersecting airstrip, an official told CNN Homeland Security correspondent Jeanne Meserve.

The SkyWest aircraft, which was coming in behind the other jet, was ordered to circle around the airport after an air traffic controller recognized the potential conflict, the official said. It made an otherwise normal landing.

The ExpressJet takeoff was not altered.

The flights were being handled by different air traffic controllers, according to the official, who said there was "no operational error" -- a term used when flights get too close to each other.

The official did not say how close the planes were.

The incident took place shortly after Biden's plane landed at the airport for the inauguration of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.
