Washington (CNN) -- Several shots have been fired at the National Museum of the Marine Corps building in Virginia, the FBI said Friday.

No injuries were reported.

It is the second time the Marine Corps museum in Triangle, Virginia, has been fired on in recent days. The Pentagon and a vacant Marine Corps Recruiting Station in Virginia also were shot at recently. All the previous shots came from the same weapon, authorities said.

Federal officials said they believe that the person taking the late-night shots at military-related buildings has a grievance against the institution of the Marine Corps but not the men and women serving in the Marines.

The officials said at a news conference that they want to talk with the shooter.

"We'd like to know what this grievance is and what we can do to try to resolve it," said John Perren, assistant director of the FBI's Washington field office.

The latest incident occurred Thursday night, said Gwen Adams, spokeswoman at the National Museum of the Marine Corps. No one was in the building at the time, she said.

New bullet holes were found in the glass and metal structure of the building but not inside, Adams said. The new damage was found during a routine inspection, officials said.

The bullet holes were on the western side of the building, which faces Interstate 95, the FBI said. The shots probably came from the interstate, said Maj. Mike Crosbie of the Prince William County, Virginia, police department.

The museum was closed Friday morning while the investigation continued, Adams said. It will remain closed for the rest of the day, she said.

There were no plans Friday to cancel or postpone Sunday's Marine Corps Marathon or any events connected with it, race spokeswoman Tami Faram said.

Additional security measures have been taken, however, to bolster an "already robust plan" for security at the marathon, Col. Daniel J. Choike, the commander of Marine Corps Base Quantico, said Friday.
