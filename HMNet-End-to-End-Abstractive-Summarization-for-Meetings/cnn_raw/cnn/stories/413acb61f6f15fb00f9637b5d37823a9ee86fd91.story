(CNN) -- Both "12 Years A Slave" and "Gravity" lost out on the best ensemble prize at Saturday's Screen Actors Guild Awards, but both films were still celebrating when the weekend ended.

At the Producers Guild of America Awards on Sunday, the two critically acclaimed projects won the ceremony's big prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck producer of the year award in theatrical motion pictures.

The award is given out in recognition of the "finest production work" of the year, but has also been a pretty solid predictor of which film will walk away with the best picture Oscar.

But with Sunday's tie -- the first of its kind in the PGA's history -- prognosticators may have a harder time figuring out if it's Alfonso Cuaron's "Gravity" that has a lock on best picture, or Steve McQueen's "12 Years A Slave."

On the animated film side, "Frozen" was also honored for its production work, while "Breaking Bad" and "Modern Family" were awarded prizes for outstanding production of a TV drama and comedy, respectively.
