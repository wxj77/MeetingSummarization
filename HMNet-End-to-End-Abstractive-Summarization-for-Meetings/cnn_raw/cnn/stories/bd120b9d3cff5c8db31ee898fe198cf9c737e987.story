(CNN Student News) -- November 26, 2013

CNN Student News' last program before Thanksgiving explains why travelers might want to pack patience before heading out: A stretch of winter weather is threatening transportation across the U.S. We also cover stories involving Christianity and Judaism, and we cook up a by-the-numbers look at the Thanksgiving holiday.

Teachers, please note that CNN Student News will not air the rest of this week for Thanksgiving. The daily program will return on Monday, December 2.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, Maps pertaining to today's show, and a place for you to leave feedback.
