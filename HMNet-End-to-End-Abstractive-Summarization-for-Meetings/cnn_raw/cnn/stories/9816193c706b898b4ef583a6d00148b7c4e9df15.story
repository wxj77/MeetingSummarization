(CNN) -- The stars of "Boy Meets World" had a busy, wedding-filled weekend.

On Saturday, actress Danielle Fishel -- Topanga to "Boy Meets World" fans -- enjoyed "one of the most amazing days" of her life as she wed Tim Belusko in a Los Angeles ceremony.

"The love in the room was palpable and overwhelming in the best way possible," the 32-year-old newlywed tweeted after the nuptials.

According to her Tumblr, Fishel met Belusko, 25, when she went back to school at 27 to get her college degree, which she happily announced she acquired last December.

She didn't completely fit in at school at first, Fishel wrote, but "I persevered and sometimes I wasn't the oldest person in class, some of the whisperers became good friends, and I did so well in math, I even became a tutor. And that is how I met my fiancÃ©."

For whatever reason, those whispering critics are still around: Fishel tweeted on Sunday that she was receiving criticism because she married someone younger.

"Tim is mature, responsible, loving, & kind," she posted. "Way to judge people, Internet."

But as Fishel fought back against her haters, her former costar, Rider Strong, was embarking on his own walk down the aisle.

The 33-year-old actor married fellow actress Alexandra Barreto, 31, at a summer camp in Oregon, according to People magazine.

Unfortunately, Strong was "missing some of my 'Boy Meets World' family" at the event, but it was his fault: "(Danielle) chose the date first," he explained.

Even with the scheduling conflict, Strong couldn't be happier. "I'm incredibly lucky to be getting married to my best friend and partner-in-crime," he said in a statement.
