(CNN Student News) -- October 1, 2013

October's first edition of CNN Student News begins with the uncertainty that ringed Washington, D.C. last night. We also look at the pros and cons of a new law that aims to give minors in California a "delete all" button when it comes to social media. And at the start of National Bullying Prevention Month, our Viewfinder segment brings some students' ideas on how to curb bullying.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, Maps pertaining to today's show, and a place for you to leave feedback.
