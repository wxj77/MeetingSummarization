Nancy Motes, the half-sister of actress Julia Roberts, was found dead in a Los Angeles home Sunday, the coroner's spokesman said.

Paramedics were called to the home after Motes, 37, was found on the floor of a bathroom, according to Los Angeles County Coroner's Assistant Chief Ed Winter.

She was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:12 p.m. Sunday, Winter said.

"She has a history of some medical issues," Winter said.Â  "Some prescription drugs were found near her body."

The case is under investigation by the coroner's officer and an autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday, Winter said.
