(CNN) -- The best thing about flying? Gawking at good-looking strangers.

Maybe you spotted a Ryan Gosling clone in the departure lounge who set your heart aflutter. Or perhaps that mysterious tattooed woman who set off the metal detectors with all her piercings caught your fancy.

There's just one problem. Serendipity fails to strike. You board the plane and find your dream girl/guy isn't seated anywhere near you.

But there's good news for helpless romantics.

Thanks to Virgin America's not at all creepy new service, passengers can use the airline's "Red" in-flight entertainment system to send a drink, meal or snack to the object of their affection.

So, once you've pinpointed your designated hottie with Virgin's digital seat map, what comes next? Browse the menu and decide what to send over.

Maybe he looks like a Bombay Sapphire kind of a guy. And what lady can resist an ice cold Bud Light? She'll be yours in no time.

Follow up with a text sent through the seat-to-seat messaging system. The cheesier the better.

"This Bud's for you, sexy lady."

"Is there an airport nearby or is that just my heart taking off?"

Getting lucky

Virgin America launched the new seat-to-seat delivery option this week to mark the start of its Los Angeles to Las Vegas service, though it's available on all of the airline's U.S. flights.

The big man himself helped introduce the new feature with a video titled, "Sir Richard Branson's Guide to Getting Lucky."

"I'm not a betting man, but I'd say your chance of deplaning with a plus-one are at least 50%," he concludes.

The only problem we foresee is a surge in the number of passengers prowling up and down the aisles "going to the bathroom" for a fourth and fifth time.
