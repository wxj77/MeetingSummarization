(CNN) -- Bomb squads Tuesday dismantled an unspecified number of devices at a high school near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, after a student opened fire at a school police officer, authorities said.

Officers neutralized devices found at Socastee High School, said Sgt. Robert Kegler of the Horry County Police Department. Kegler did not indicate the number or nature of the devices.

The school was evacuated during the incident. The devices were found several hours after the shooting, police said.

The unidentified male student was in the office of Officer Erik Karney about 2 p.m. and opened fire with a handgun, police told CNN affiliate WMBF. Kegler did not know what the two were discussing at the time.

Karney suffered minor injuries when the bullet struck a wall and shrapnel hit his face. The officer, who was later released from medical care, was able to detain the student, Kegler said.

The student, whose age was not released, was detained by Horry County Police in connection with the incident.

Kegler confirmed that investigators are also looking into a Twitter account containing suspicious posts.

The campus and surrounding area were searched by bomb-detecting robots and a K-9 team Tuesday evening. The school will reopen Wednesday.

Teal Britton, spokeswoman for Horry County Schools, confirmed to WMBF that metal detectors were not used on students entering the school Tuesday morning. That will change Wednesday morning, she said, adding that there will be at least two metal detectors at each entrance to the school.
