(CNN) -- Cher has announced on Twitter that she is working on writing and starring in an autobiographical Broadway show.

"Prods. R writing mucial [sic] now about my life with my music," reads the initial post, revealing that the musical will track three different versions of Cher throughout the singer's life.

"I'm help.2 write cause i was there & know stories that no1 knows but me," she follows.

Cher's character will appear as a young singer through the Sonny and Cher era, then as a solo artist from the late Seventies through her Believe tour in 1999, and finally as a present-day incarnation looking back on her life, career and earlier versions of herself.

No further casting or creative team members have been revealed, and no timeline has been given. Although Cher has won at least one Oscar, Emmy and Grammy, she has yet to win a Tony Award.
