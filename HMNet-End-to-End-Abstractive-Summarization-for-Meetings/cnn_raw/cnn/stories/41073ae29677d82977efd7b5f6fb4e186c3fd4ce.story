(EW.com) -- Ready for a little more turnover in NBC's late-night landscape?

The Peacock is apparently in early discussions with Alec Baldwin to host a talk show that would possibly air at 1:35 a.m. â€” real estate that is currently occupied by "Last Call with Carson Daly" â€” according to The New York Times. A source tells EW that the proposed program could be a Tom Snyder-esque intimate interview talk show. NBC declined to comment.

The 55-year-old actor, who won two Emmys during his seven seasons on "30 Rock," has some shiny emcee credits on his resume: He has hosted "Saturday Night Live" no less than 16 times, he has co-hosted the Oscars, and he hosts a weekly interview podcast called "Here's the Thing" on WNYC, in which he journeys into the homes and dressing rooms of celebrities like Chris Rock, Michael Douglas, David Letterman, and Lena Dunham.

'NCIS' react: OK, now it's on!

Last week, NBC confirmed the news that Jimmy Fallon will succeed Jay Leno as host of "The Tonight Show" in February, which means Fallon's "Late Night" chair will need to be filled.

In addition to "Last Call," which is in its 12th season, Daly also hosts NBC's "The Voice."
