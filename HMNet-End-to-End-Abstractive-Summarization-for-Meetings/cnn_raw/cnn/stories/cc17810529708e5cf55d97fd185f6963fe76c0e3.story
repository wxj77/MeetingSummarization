(CNN) -- Yamaha rider Jorge Lorenzo notched up his 46th career pole position on Saturday at qualifying for the Spanish MotoGP in Jerez.

The 2010 world champion, who finished first in the season-opening Qatar MotoGP, narrowly beat compatriot Dani Pedrosa on a Honda in a time of one minute 39.532 seconds.

Lorenzo and Pedrosa battled for the fastest time throughout qualifying but it was Lorenzo who finished on top bettering Pedrosa's fastest lap time at the circuit set back in 2010.

"We are very happy with this pole position because it was a strange session. There were a lot of water patches and it was very dangerous. You had to pay a lot of attention, it would have been easy to crash and get injured," Lorenzo said.

"Anyway we start in first position so let's see what happens in the race. Thank you to the team for working hard to keep giving the right set up in changing conditions," he added.

America's Nicky Hayden was third fastest on his Ducati while England's Cal Crutchlow recovered from a spectacular crash to finish fourth.

Defending world champion Casey Stoner of Australia will start Sunday's race in fifth.

Italy's Valentino Rossi once again had a disappointing day and will start down in 13th place.
