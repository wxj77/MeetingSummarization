"Twenty-one is a terrific number," Sheindlin said in a statement. "It's when you officially become an adult, it's a winning hand in blackjack and it's the number of seasons we will have hit in 2017. I am so fortunate to have a job that I still love, working with a staff I respect and with a company who is at the top of their game."
