(CNN) -- The United States will face Turkey in the finals of the world basketball championships after defeating Lithuania 89-74 Saturday.

NBA star Durant set the tone for his team's semi-final win by pounding Lithuania with a 17-point scoring blitz in the first eight minutes.

By the final buzzer he had also added nine rebounds to his 38 points.

After defeating world number one Argentina on Thursday, the Lithuanians looked as if they had already played their final, offering little resistance for an on-song American team.

Having grown accustomed to coming back from slow starts throughout this tournament Lithuania would not have been too concerned about falling behind early, trailing USA 23-12 at the end of the opening quarter.

Any hopes that Lithuania had off staging another of their famous comebacks dimmed with the USA still well in control, 42-27 when the half-time buzzer sounded.

The US's intensity did not let up following the break, assuring the Lithuanians would not come within nine points of them throughout the quarter to still be leading comfortably 65-53 with a quarter remaining.

In the other semifinal on Saturday hosts Turkey edged Serbia 83-82 in a thrilling match.
