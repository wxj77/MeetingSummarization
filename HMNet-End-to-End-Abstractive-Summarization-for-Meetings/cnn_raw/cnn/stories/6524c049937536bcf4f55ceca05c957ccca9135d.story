New York (CNN) -- A cancer-stricken New Jersey student asked by superstar singer Taylor Swift to join her at Sunday's Academy of Country Music Awards is too ill to attend, supporters said.

A Facebook group started by Kevin McGuire's older sister, Victoria, said Saturday that her 18-year-old brother was admitted to the hospital Friday night.

The post continued, saying, "Please continue to pray for Kevin and his health, because that is the most important thing. As for Taylor, she is just as depressed as all of us to miss out on this date, and we are so thankful for the opportunity she has given us."

The country sweetheart took to her Twitter page hours after, confirming the sad news. Swift wrote, "Just talked to Kevin McGuire. He's not well enough to join me at the ACMs. Please keep him in your thoughts. I'll make it up to you, Kevin!"

McGuire, 18, was diagnosed with leukemia in 2007 at the age of 13. The cancer was in remission for years before a relapse. Realizing he would lose his hair because of treatment, McGuire was worried about securing a date to his upcoming senior prom. Victoria McGuire asked, "What if I got Taylor Swift?"

Victoria started the "Taylor Swift take Kevin McGuire to prom" Facebook page in February. It went viral overnight, gathering the attention of Ms. Swift herself.

Shortly after, Swift expressed her apologies that she couldn't accompany McGuire to his prom. She did, however, ask him to be her date to the music awards show.
