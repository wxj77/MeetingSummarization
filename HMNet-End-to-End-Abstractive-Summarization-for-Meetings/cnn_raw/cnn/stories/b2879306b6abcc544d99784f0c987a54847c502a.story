(CNN) -- Police in London have arrested six men for questioning in connection with death of a man outside Wembley Stadium.

The incident took place prior to the Euro 2012 qualifying match between England and Wales on Tuesday evening.

The man who died has been named as Michael Dye, 44, from Cardiff, Wales.

The six men in custody are also believed to be Welsh supporters. No England fans are thought to have been involved.

A message of sympathy was posted on the Cardiff City Football Club web site on Wednesday and fans tied scarves and replica shirts to the gates of the stadium.

Gethin Jenkins, Cardiff City's chief executive said in a statement: "Our thoughts and condolences go to Mike's family and friends at this devastating time. Mike was clearly a committed and passionate supporter of the club for many years and his passing is extremely sad to many within our community and the football family at large."

England won the game 1-0.
