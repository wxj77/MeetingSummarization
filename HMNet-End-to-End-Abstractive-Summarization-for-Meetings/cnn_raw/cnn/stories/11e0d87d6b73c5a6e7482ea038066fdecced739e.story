(CNN) -- The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said Thursday that the U.N. Security Council is not doing enough to root out Sudanese war criminals suspected of genocide.

Fatou Bensouda said her team of investigators had uncovered an "ongoing pattern of crimes committed pursuant to the government-avowed goal of stopping the rebellion in Darfur," noting specific attacks on peacekeepers and civilians in the region.

She then blasted the council, asking "how many more civilians must be killed, injured and displaced for this council to be spurred into doing its part?"

The International Criminal Court has been seeking the arrest of Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir on charges of genocide during a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur, a province in western Sudan that is about the size of Spain.

Some 300,000 people have died in Darfur, the United Nations estimates, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes.

A June 2011 Human Rights Watch report said that about 70,000 people had become displaced by aerial from Darfur bombardments since the preceding December.
