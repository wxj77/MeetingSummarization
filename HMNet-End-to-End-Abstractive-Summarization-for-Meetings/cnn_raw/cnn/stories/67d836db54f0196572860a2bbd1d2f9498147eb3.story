An Israeli was stabbed Sunday near central Jerusalem, police said, the latest in a string of similar attacks.

The 32-year-old was stabbed with a screwdriver, police said. Authorities are searching for the attacker, described as an Arab youth who fled in the direction of Damascus Gate, an entrance to Jerusalem's Old City.

The victim was taken to a hospital in moderate condition, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.

Last week, a 20-year-old was stabbed and killed in Tel Aviv, and three people were stabbed -- one fatally -- near the entrance to a settlement in the West Bank.  The latter incident took place at the same hitchhiking spot where three Israeli teens were kidnapped earlier this year; they were later killed.

One alleged attacker was caught; the other was shot by a security guard, police said.

Israel has also recently been facing what some call an "auto intifada" -- a spate of attacks on Jewish civilians in Jerusalem by Palestinians driving vehicles.

The violence has stirred fears of another intifada, or armed uprising -- though analysts say there's no sign yet that one is on the way.

Meanwhile, an Israeli border policeman has been detained in Israel in connection with the May shooting death of a Palestinian teen.

Palestinians are facing a fresh internal rift between the two major political factions: Fatah, which controls the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls Gaza.  Fatah recently accused Hamas of bombing Fatah leaders' homes.
