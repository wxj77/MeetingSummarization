(CNN) -- Bradley Wiggins all but secured his maiden Tour de France victory on Saturday with a storming ride in the 19th and penultimate stage of the race from Bonneval to Chartres.

The 32-year-old Sky team rider crossed the finish line in first place, completing the 53.5-kilometer time trial in one hour, four minutes and 13 seconds.

The win extends Wiggins' overall lead to nearly three-and-a-half minutes over his teammate Chris Froome, and more than six minutes over Liquigas rider Vincenzo Nibali who is third.

"I don't know what to say. Only one more day to go, and I've won the yellow jersey," Wiggins said.

"I've a lot of emotions and a lot of relief it's finished. It's a dream come true, but I've been working to win this for the past five years. The job is done, almost," he added.

Sunday's final stage to Paris does not traditionally involve a contest for the coveted yellow jersey meaning Wiggins has virtually guaranteed his place in history as the first British rider to win the Tour.

Dave Brailsford, manager of the Sky team said: "We made it our objective to win this race within five years with a clean, British rider, and that's what we've done. It might be a surprise to everyone else, but it's not a surprise to us."

Defending champion Cadel Evans had another disappointing day. The Australian finished the stage in seventh place overall, nearly 16 minutes behind Wiggins.

Following his stage win, Wiggins' wife, Cath tweeted: "Right everyone I am calling it. Operation drink as much champagne as you can. GO."
