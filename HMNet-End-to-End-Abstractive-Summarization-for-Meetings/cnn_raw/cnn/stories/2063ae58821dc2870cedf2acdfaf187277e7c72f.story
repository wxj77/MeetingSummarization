(CNN) -- The space shuttle Endeavour docked with the international space station early Wednesday, completing a three-day orbital chase.

"Capture confirmed," the Johnson Space Center in Houston said at 12:06 a.m. ET.

The delicate docking maneuver took place while both spacecraft were circling the globe at about 17,500 mph (28,165 km/h).

Endeavour lifted off from Kennedy Space Center early Monday.

During the two-week mission, the six-member crew will deliver an Italian-built Tranquility node and a seven-windowed cupola to the station, which will be used as a control room for robotics. The mission also will include three spacewalks.

The space station will be about 90 percent complete once the node and cupola are added, NASA said.
