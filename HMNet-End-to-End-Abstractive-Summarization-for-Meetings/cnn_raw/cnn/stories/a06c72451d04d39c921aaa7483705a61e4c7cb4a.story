(CNN) -- World champion Marc Marquez clinched his 11th victory of the season Sunday after returning to winning ways at the British MotoGP at Silverstone.

The 21-year-old has had a stunning season so far, clinching 10 pole positions and winning all but one of twelve races.

His only blip was a fourth-place finish in the last MotoGP in the Czech Republic.

But the Spanish Honda rider didn't have it all his own way at Silverstone and enjoyed a pulsating fight with two-time world champion Jorge Lorenzo, whose Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi was third.

"Honestly Jorge was much stronger than I expected," Marquez said after extending his championship lead to 89 points over Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa, who was fourth.

"When I passed him the first time I made a small mistake and he got the lead back ... However, I recalled what happened last year and I didn't want a repeat of that so I ensured once I got back in front again I wouldn't let it slip."

In an engrossing race last year's winner Lorenzo initially took the lead from Marquez at the start. Marquez stayed on Lorenzo's shoulder throughout and managed to pass him, only for Lorenzo to take the lead again with five laps to go.

But two laps later, and after one failed overtaking maneuver, Marquez finally took the lead and stayed there.
