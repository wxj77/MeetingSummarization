(EW.com) -- She might not get paid as much as "Iron Man," but there's no doubt that celestial beauty Angelina Jolie is smiling all the way to the bank.

This year, Jolie topped Forbes' annual list of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood with an incredibly robust $33 million.

Though her last big-budget feature was the much maligned "The Tourist" back in 2010, Jolie has spent the past few years developing, writing and directing flicks such as "In the Land of Blood and Honey" and the upcoming "Unbroken," and even found time to film Disney's "Maleficent."

'Divergent' fun: Which faction would Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lawrence and more be placed in?

You see, Angelina Jolie is so wealthy that she can basically stop acting, develop some very small indie flicks and still make money.

Everyone's dream best friend Jennifer Lawrence came in second on the list, pocketing a cool $26 million, which will go well with her Oscar. Rounding out the top five are past payday queen Kristen Stewart ($22 million), America's Sweetheart Jennifer Aniston ($20 million), and America's Sweetheart Part II Emma Stone ($16 million).

So three out of the top five are under 24 years of age, while the other two on the list have a very, very, very famous man in common.

Plus, when added together, the top five women in Hollywood earned a collective $117 million â€” talk about Girl Power!

Of course, this pales in comparison to the $308 million that Hollywood's top five male actors earned last year but hey, baby steps.
