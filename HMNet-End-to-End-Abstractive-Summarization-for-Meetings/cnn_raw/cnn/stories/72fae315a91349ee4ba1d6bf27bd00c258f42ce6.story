(CNN) -- The son of late evangelist Oral Roberts and former president of Oral Roberts University was arrested early Tuesday on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding, authorities said.

Richard Roberts, 63, was stopped by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol just after midnight after a trooper observed him traveling at about 93 mph on a turnpike in his Mercedes-Benz sedan, according to an arrest report. The speed limit on the road is 65 mph, the report said.

The trooper "detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage about Roberts' breath and person," the report said, and Roberts failed field sobriety tests.

Roberts consented to a breath test, which showed his blood alcohol level at .11%, higher than the .08% limit for legal intoxication.

He was booked into the Tulsa County Jail. CNN affiliate KOTV in Tulsa said he posted bond and was released a few hours later.

Roberts was president of Oral Roberts University until 2007. Oral Roberts died in 2009.

Roberts appears on the television show "The Place for Miracles: Your Hour of Healing," according to the Oral Roberts Ministries website.

"Our prayers go out to Richard and Lindsay Roberts and their entire family as they face this life challenge," said Jeremy Burton, spokesman for Oral Roberts University. "May God's grace help them as they work toward healing."

CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.
