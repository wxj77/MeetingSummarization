MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A plane carrying dozens of British vacationers skidded on landing in Spain's Canary Islands on Friday morning, briefly causing the closure of the runway but causing no injuries, the country's airport authority said.

The Air Europa Boeing-737 sits parked at the end of the runway at the airport in Lanzarote.

The Thomas Cook-chartered Air Europa flight was arriving at the airport on the island of Lanzarote at 7:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) when it skidded off the runway, spokespeople for the airport authority told CNN.

However two Air Europa spokespeople disagreed and said the plane came to rest at the end of the runway's asphalt.

The flight from Glasgow, Scotland was carrying 74 passengers and six crew members.

A spokesman for travel agent Thomas Cook told the British Press Association: "We can confirm that an Air Europa flight (AEA196), which was charted by Thomas Cook, was involved in a runway incident at Lanzarote's Arrecife Airport this morning.

"Thomas Cook staff were on hand at the airport to assist all passengers and can confirm that all guests are now en route to their holiday hotels.

"Thomas Cook has called on Air Europa and the airport authorities to provide a full explanation."

Air Europa said it was investigating what caused the plane to skid. The plane was not damaged, the company added.

The incident caused the airport runway to be closed for three hours, during which time the plane was removed from the runway, the airport spokesman said.

The runway reopened at 10:25 a.m. (6:25 a.m. ET), he said.

Air Europa was founded in 1986 and is based in Palma, on the Spanish island of Majorca. Its fleet comprises of 32 modern Boeing aircraft and an Airbus A340, PA said.
