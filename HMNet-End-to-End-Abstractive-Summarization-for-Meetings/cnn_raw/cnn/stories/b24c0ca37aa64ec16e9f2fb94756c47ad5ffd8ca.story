(CNN) -- A teen bull rider was kicked at least once in the chest after she was thrown and later died, Florida authorities said Saturday.

Brooke Ann Coats, 16, died from injuries Friday evening at Tampa General Hospital, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.

Coats was able to walk out of the ring after the 8:30 p.m. incident at 301 Rodeo on U.S. 301S, east of Tampa, the office said in a statement. She experienced difficulty breathing and collapsed.

An off-duty paramedic rendered aid until Coats was taken to the hospital, where she died during surgery, officials said.

An investigation continues, but detectives do not suspect foul play.
