Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Whether it's as activists or politicians, artists or business leaders, women in the Middle East are stepping into the spotlight as never before.

Some stereotypes still need to be challenged; domestic violence, illiteracy and conservative views continue to fuel a gender gap in many part of the region.

However, women are now proving their worth in most walks of life.

Meanwhile in Istanbul, the base for this month's show, Turkey's first female film director Cahide Sonku -- adorns the wall of the Istanbul Modern Art Museum, which is celebrating Turkey's women artists.
