(CNN) -- Students at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee held a vigil Sunday night to remember a basketball player who was stabbed to death earlier in the day.

Police found Shannon Washington with a knife wound to her neck in her apartment early Sunday morning. She later died at a hospital.

Authorities have charged a friend, 20-year-old Starquineshia Palmer, with first-degree murder in the death.

Police said Palmer was visiting Washington for the weekend, but have not disclosed a motive in the killing.

"For Shannon to be killed in the prime of her life is tragic and senseless," said FAMU President James Ammons. "She had so much promise as a student athlete. This is a great loss for the university and our athletic program."

Washington transferred to the university from Illinois Valley Community College and was expected to play in the fall as a shooting guard.
