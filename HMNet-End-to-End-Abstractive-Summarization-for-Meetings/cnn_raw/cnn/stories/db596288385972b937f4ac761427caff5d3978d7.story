DENVER, Colorado (CNN)  -- Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama called his acceptance speech on Thursday "the American Promise." It included a list of promises for change that he said, "We need right now."

Sen. Barack Obama addresses the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.

Here is a look at what Obama said he would do, if elected, about a variety of topics:

Taxes

Obama said he would:

• Cut taxes "for 95 percent of all working families."

•  "Eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses" and start-ups "that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow."

• Advocate "a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it."

•  "Stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas" and "start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America."

Energy

Obama said he would:

• Set a goal that "in 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East."

•  "Tap natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power."

• "Help our auto companies retool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America."  Watch Obama's acceptance speech »

• Make it easier for Americans to afford U.S.-built, fuel-efficient cars.

• Have the federal government "invest $150 billion over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy -- wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels." Doing so, he said, would "lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced."

Education

Obama said he would:

• "Finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education."

• Find more money for early childhood education and recruit teachers with better pay while also pushing "higher standards and more accountability."

• "Rebuild our military to meet future conflicts."

Foreign relations

Obama said he would:

• "Restore our moral standing" in the world.
