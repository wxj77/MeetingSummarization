(EW.com) -- Matt Smith, of "Doctor Who" fame, will star as Patrick Bateman in the London production of the "American Psycho" musical, EW has confirmed.

Smith will play the metrosexual, murderous businessman from Bret Easton Ellis' novel of the same name. Rupert Goold (ENRON, The Merchant of Venice) will direct. Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa adapted Ellis' novel for the stage, and Duncan Sheik composed the music and lyrics.

The musical adaptation will run from Dec. 3 of this year to Jan. 25 of 2014 at London's Almeida Theatre.

If you're curious about the "American Psycho" rehearsals, Director Rupert Goold has been tweeting photos from the set.

Smith's final appearances as the Doctor will be the 50th anniversary episode in November and the Christmas special.

Do you think the exiting Doctor will make for a good Patrick Bateman? More importantly, does he use enough exfoliating products in his morning routine?
