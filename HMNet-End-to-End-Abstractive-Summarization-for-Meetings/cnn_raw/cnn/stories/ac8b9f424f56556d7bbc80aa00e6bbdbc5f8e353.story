(CNN) -- Spain's Dani Pedrosa will miss the Malaysian MotoGP on Sunday, after the rider broke his collarbone in practice for the Grand Prix in Japan last week.

Pedrosa's absence means championship leader Jorge Lorenzo will now only have to finish in the top 10 at the race in Sepang, in order to be crowned 2010 champion.

Respol Honda racer Pedrosa suffered a double fracture of the collarbone in Motegi, and has subsequently undergone surgery.

It was thought that the 25-year-old, who currently lies in second place behind Lorenzo in the MotoGP standings, might have recovered in time to challenge for the championship in Malaysia.

However, in an announcement on the sport's website on Thursday his team confirmed he would not be racing.

"Pedrosa has made the understandable decision to stay at home to continue his recovery," the statement from Respol Honda read.

"The target for his return remains the Australian Grand Prix, practice for which begins on October 15."

The team also confirmed that they would not be fielding a replacement driver for the race, leaving Italy's Andrea Dovizioso as their sole representative.

With Pedrosa not competing, Yamaha driver Lorenzo is now more than 100 points clear of his nearest challenger -- Australian Ducati driver Casey Stoner.

The 25-year-old is looking for his first world title at MotoGP level, after twice achieving the feat in the 250cc category, first in 2006 and again in 2007.
