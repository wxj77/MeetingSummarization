(CNN) -- Stargazers glimpsed a rare treat as a "blood moon" crossed the Earth's shadow Tuesday.

The moon took on a devilish glow as it appeared in different phases from 2 to 4 a.m. ET.

Hundreds of people from North and South America, where the blood moon was most visible, shared their images of the lunar spectacle with CNN iReport.

"My dad and I have been planning to view this for many months, and it was truly a breathtaking experience," said high school student and astronomy enthusiast Ahan Malhotra from Miami.

If rain or clouds obscured your lunar experience, don't fret. This episode is the first of four consecutive total lunar eclipses -- known as the tetrad -- that will occur in six-month intervals until September 2015.

Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye and don't require special filters.
