(CNN) -- I will always love you.

Unless you cause a ruckus and divert a non-stop flight from Los Angeles to New York to another airport.

A customer on an American Airlines flight would not stop singing "I will always love you," the classic Dolly Parton song also made famous by the late Whitney Houston in the movie "The Bodyguard."

The flight was diverted to Kansas City's airport on Thursday after the woman became disruptive, according to CNN affiliate KMBC in Kansas City. A passenger video appears to show the woman singing the song as she's taken off the airplane by police.

"The passenger was detained, not arrested, and then released pending further investigation by the TSA (Transportation Safety Administration) and federal air marshals," said Tom McKenna, a Kansas City International Airport spokesman.

"I can confirm that she was singing 'I Will Always Love You' as she was escorted off the plane." said McKenna.

Kansas City Aviation Department officials told KMBC that the woman failed to cooperate with a federal air marshal. KMBC reports that the woman told authorities her behavior was a result of her diabetes.

"The only thing I can confirm is that American Airlines Flight 4 from Los Angeles (LAX) to New York (JFK) last Thursday evening diverted to Kansas City (MCI) because of a disruptive passenger," American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller told CNN.
