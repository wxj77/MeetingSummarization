Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Christina Aguilera has split with husband Jordan Bratman, but there was no immediate talk of divorce, her representative said Tuesday.

"Although Jordan and I are separated, our commitment to our son Max remains as strong as ever," Aguilera said in a statement released Tuesday through her representative.

The 29-year-old singer-actress and the 33-year-old music executive married five years ago. Their son, Max, was born two years ago.

Aguilera co-stars with Cher in "Burlesque," a major feature film set for a Thanksgiving release.
