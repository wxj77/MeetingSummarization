(CNN) -- Country legend Hank Williams Jr. took the lead on a benefit concert to aid victims of the recent devastating storms, tornadoes and flooding. "Music Builds: The CMT Disaster Relief Concert" airs at 9 p.m. ET Thursday on CMT.

Williams will be joined by Alabama, Alan Jackson, Keith Urban, Lady Antebellum, Little Big Town, Ronnie Dunn, Sara Evans, Tim McGraw, Trace Adkins and many others.

All proceeds will go to the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund.

Williams said the benefit concert is personal. "I just couldn't believe what I was seeing on TV," he said. "Alabama is home. I am really pumped about helping."

HLN's Robin Meade will co-host the event with sports reporter Erin Andrews and comedian Ron White.

HLN will re-air the concert on Sunday at 9 p.m. ET followed by a half-hour special, "Music Builds: Backstage with Robin Meade," at 10:30 p.m.

Meade will talk to some of the concert's biggest performers about their involvement and why it's so important to help.

Red Cross phone lines will be open Sunday night as the concert re-airs to give viewers more opportunity to give.
