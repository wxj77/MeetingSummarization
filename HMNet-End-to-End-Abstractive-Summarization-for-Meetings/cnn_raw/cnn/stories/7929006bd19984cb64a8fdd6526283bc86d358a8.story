Bang & Olufsen squeezes hi-fi into a phone

Danish hi-fi maestro B&O has lent its expertise to the luxury Lumigon T2. Beneath the phone's precision-machined metal details lie B&O ICEpower Audio and an infra-red transmitter for controlling hi-fi equipment. Owners can also look forward to using gesture controls to control the phone with a wave of a hand.

Nokia's 41-megapixel cameraphone

Eight megapixel cameras on phones have become increasingly common, but Nokia has smashed that with its 41-megapixel newcomer -- the 808 PureView. Promising better performance in low light and more creative shooting opportunities, it remains to be seen whether more megapixels will really mean better pictures.

Samsung tablet headed for schools

The new Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet follows the example of its (only slightly) smaller phone namesake by bringing the stylus back to touchscreens. The included S-pen allows for the use of handwriting recognition and fine control in creative applications like digital drawing and photo manipulation. Samsung is pushing it as an educational tool for use in classrooms, as well as by everyday consumers.

ZTE's wafer thin quad-core powerhouse

The comparatively little known Chinese manufacturer ZTE has launched a veritable armada of new phones, the most noteworthy of which is the ZTE Era. The well-specified phone packs the lightning-quick Nvidia Tegra 3 quad core processor while still managing to come in at 7.8mm thick.

Vodafone and Visa team up for contactless payment

Visa PayWay will soon be making its way onto Vodafone mobile phones. The payment service, which uses Near Field Communication similar to that used in London's Oyster Cards and Barclays' contactless debit cards, will allow users to pay for items by simply passing their phone over a compatible reader.
