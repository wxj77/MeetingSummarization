(CNN) -- A bipartisan group of senators on Monday presented a legislative plan for comprehensive immigration reform one day before President Barack Obama was to offer his ideas. Those efforts, and possibly more to come, signal the largest movement in years aimed at overhauling the nation's immigration system.

65: Percentage of those gaining LPR status that had a family relationship with a U.S. citizen or someone who already has legal, permanent status.

23.1: Millions of foreign-born workers in the U.S. labor force, as of 2010.

114: Bills enacted by 41 state legislatures in the first half of 2012 that addressed legal immigrants, migrants, and seasonal workers.

56,384: People admitted to the United States as refugees in 2011.

20: States that require the use of "E-verify," which allows businesses to determine whether potential employees have the right to live and work in the U.S. as of November 2012.

2,955: Migrants intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard in fiscal year 2012.
