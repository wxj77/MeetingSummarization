Washington (CNN) -- The Democratic candidate for governor of Massachusetts just got some more bad news.

Attorney General Martha Coakley became the first Democratic governor candidate in 20 years to not receive the endorsement of the Boston Globe in the general election, with the publication instead endorsing Republican Charlie Baker on Sunday. The endorsement comes on the heels of the race's latest poll, which showed Coakley down by 9 points.

The Boston-based newspaper, the most prominent in the state, backed Baker, claiming the Republican would deliver more effective state governance.

The newspaper's editorial board suggested that the prospects of Baker and a veto-proof Democratic majority in the state legislature could result in "creative tension," forcing both parties to come together and solve the state's problems.

"One needn't agree with every last one of Baker's views to conclude that, at this time, the Republican nominee would provide the best counterpoint to the instincts of an overwhelmingly Democratic Legislature," the endorsement reads.

The newspaper also endorsed Baker over Coakley because it claimed the Republican would in fact be the better candidate to "consolidate" outgoing Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick's legacy on reforms tied to education, health care and public transportation.

"At a difficult inflection point in state government, Massachusetts needs a governor who's focused on steady management and demonstrable results," the Globe's editorial board wrote.

Democrats are boosting efforts to save Coakley's declining stock. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joined Patrick and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at a campaign rally for Coakley on Friday.

Clinton's visit came after her husband former President Bill Clinton and First Lady Michelle Obama have also rallied voters in Massachusetts to support Coakley. And Vice President Joe Biden will head to the state for a fundraiser on Wednesday.
