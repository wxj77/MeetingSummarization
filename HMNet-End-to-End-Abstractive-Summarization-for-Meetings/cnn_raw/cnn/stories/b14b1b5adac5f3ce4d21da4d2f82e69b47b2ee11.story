LONDON, England (CNN) -- Fashion photographer Rankin took time out from his career to take powerful pictures of people from Congo.

One of Rankin's images.

He visited a refugee camp with the charity Oxfam and his work is now being exhibited in London.

The photos are posed like a fashion shoot and different to the regular images coming out of conflict zones.

"I wanted to make the people who saw the photos look at the people and see them as people, not see them as victims," Rankin told CNN.

Oxfam says 10 million people have died in the last 10 years in the Democratic Republic Of Congo. In the last few weeks, a fragile cease-fire has broken down.

The conflict is complicated by outside forces and a variety of armed groups fighting both the government and each other.

Rankin said the people he photographed just "wanted the thing to stop."
