(CNN) -- Andy Roddick cruised to victory in the Sony Ericsson Open on Sunday with a straight sets triumph over Tomas Berdych in the final in Miami.

The sixth-seeded American -- who had not won a Masters title on the ATP Tour for four years -- fired 13 ace and did not face a single set point in a 7-5 6-4 win.

Roddick finally finished opff his Czech opponent in one hour and 43 minutes to secure his 29th career title.

Berdych had beaten top seed Roger Federer en ropute to the final, while Roddick dumped out Rafael Nadal in the semifinals.

However, 16th seed Berdych never approached the form that saw him stun the world number one, as well as French Open finalist Robin Soderling.

"It's great. I won my first ever match here and it's nice to see it come full circle and I couldn't be happier," said 27-year-old Roddick in his courtside interview.

"Tomas had a great tournament and is always a guy you don't want to see in your part of the draw."

Berdych added: "Andy was really too strong so I would like to congratulate him. "It's been a great few weeks for him and a good two weeks for me so I'm really looking forward to next week."
