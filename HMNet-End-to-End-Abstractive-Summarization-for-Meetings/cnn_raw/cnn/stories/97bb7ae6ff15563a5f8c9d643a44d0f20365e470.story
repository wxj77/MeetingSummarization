(CNN) -- Kenyan police have detained a suspect in connection with the killing of a British tourist and the kidnapping of his wife, police spokesman Charles Owino told CNN Tuesday.

The attack happened at a remote safari lodge on the coast, near the border with Somalia.

About 12:30 a.m. Sunday, bandits attacked the couple, who were staying at Kiwayu Safari Village, a tourist resort on Kiwayu Island in Kiyunga division of Lamu west district on the coast, Kenyan police said.

During the attack, David Tebbut was shot dead and his wife, Judith Tebbut, was abducted, police said. The couple had arrived at the hotel Saturday afternoon after spending a week in the Masai Mara game reserve in southwestern Kenya. They were the sole guests in the hotel, which has cloth doors.

"From what we can be able to gather, he resisted, and that's why he was shot dead," Kenyan Police Commissioner Mathew Iteere said Sunday. "Maybe they wanted to take the two, but he resisted and that's why he was shot dead."

Iteere said the motive was not known. "We are treating it just as a bandit attack," he said.

A travel website lists rates at the 18-cottage resort as beginning at $400 per night.

A maritime security source aware of the situation said Sunday that Islamic militants probably took Judith Tebbut by boat toward Ras Kamboni in Somalia.
