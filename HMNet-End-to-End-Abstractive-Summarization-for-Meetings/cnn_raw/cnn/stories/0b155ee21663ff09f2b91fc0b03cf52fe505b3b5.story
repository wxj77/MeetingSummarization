(CNN) -- A Massachusetts woman found guilty in the first-degree murder of her pregnant friend has been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, according to Worcester Superior Court.

Julie Corey, who was 35 at the time of the crime, was convicted in 2009. She was found to have bludgeoned and strangled her friend, Darlene Haynes, 23, before cutting the baby from the victim's womb.

Haynes' body was found in her apartment on July 27, 2009. She was eight months pregnant at the time of her death.

Days after the murder, Haynes' baby was found with Corey in New Hampshire.

DNA evidence and a fingerprint on a bottle at the crime scene tied Corey to the killing, the district attorney's office said.

According to trial testimony, Corey tried to pass the baby off as her own to family and friends, the statement said.

"It's probably the most horrific case this office has seen," said Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. "This woman was killed for her baby."

"There was no surprise in the sentence. It is a mandatory sentence under Massachusetts statutory law. A notice of appeal has been filed," said Corey's attorney, Michael C. Wilcox.
