LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Tami Farrell, who became Miss California USA last week when Donald Trump dumped Carrie Prejean, promises to avoid controversy during the five months of her reign.

Tami Farrell became Miss California USA last week and is set to reign for five months.

"I'm trying my best to kind of calm the waters," Farrell said in an interview Sunday at the Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl.

Prejean's same-sex marriage comments, semi-nude photos and personal feud with state pageant officials contributed to a storm of controversy that brought unusual attention to the title Farrell now carries.

"I think that everything in life happens for a reason, and I'm just blessed to have this opportunity," Farrell said.

Farrell, 24, said, "it's been a crazy few days" since Wednesday, when she got the call that Prejean had been ousted.

"I keep stepping into controversy, but hopefully I can avoid it for a while," she said.

She hopes the extra attention will help launch her show business career.

"A couple of my favorite music groups have called, because I sing, so maybe we could record something together," she said. Farrell did not name the groups.

She is also a writer and has had meetings in recent days about a screenplay she's written.

"All I can tell you is that it's hilarious and that if (actor) Will Farrell or (director) Adam McCay could give me a call, things would be wonderful," she said.
