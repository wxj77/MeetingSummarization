Tokyo (CNN) -- Authorities have suspended their search for a missing crew member in a U.S. military helicopter that crashed in Okinawa after human remains were found at the site.

The helicopter crashed Monday at Camp Hansen, a Marine base on the Japanese island.

The three other crew members who were recovered from the wreckage of the HH-60 Pave Hawk are in stable condition at the U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, the U.S. Air Force said Tuesday.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for the grounding of the U.S. helicopters, while the crash is investigated.

The Pave Hawk is U.S. Air Force version of the Army's Black Hawk helicopter.
