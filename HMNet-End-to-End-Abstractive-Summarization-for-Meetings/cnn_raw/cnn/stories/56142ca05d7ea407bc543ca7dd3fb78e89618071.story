(CNN) -- Agnieszka Radwanska is ready to go out all guns blazing for a share of the $4.9million prize fund at the October's WTA Championships.

The competition, which is contracted to take place in the Turkish city of Istanbul for the next two years, will feature the top eight singles players in the world along with the four best doubles teams.

Radwanska has enjoyed a stellar year which culminated in her becoming the first Polish woman since 1939 to reach the Wimbledon final.

"I am looking forward to returning to Istanbul for the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships this year," the 23-year-old said in a press release.

"This is a goal for every player at the start of the season and I'm so happy to have made it.

"The championships is the biggest WTA event of the year and I look forward to playing against the best in the world."

Azarenka and Sharapova seal spots at lucrative WTA Championships

Radwanska, who has reached the quarterfinals or better in 13 of her past 19 tournaments, also won the Dubai Championships, Miami Masters and Brussels Open.

Currently ranked No.3 in the world, Radwanska has qualified for the tournament for the second consecutive year and will now hope to add to her 10 singles titles.

Radwanska joins world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, French Open winner Maria Sharapova and Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion Serena Williams in securing her place at the showpiece event.

The remaining places will be filled in the coming weeks, with Petra Kvitova, Angelique Kerber, Sara Errani and Li Na currently in the four spots still up for grabs.
