(CNN)  -- Roger Federer will open his defense of the men's singles title at Wimbledon against world number 65 Alejandro Falla of Colombia.

Falla has never advanced beyond the second round at Wimbledon and should offer few fears to Federer, who is bidding for a seventh title in the grass court grand slam.

World number one Rafael Nadal, seeded two at the All England Club, faces Kei Nishikori of Japan in his first-round match, but faces a potentially tougher task in the second, where he could play American James Blake, who is returning after a knee injury.

Federer looks set to have a generally easy first week, but is in the same half of the draw as Andy Roddick, Novak Djokovic and 2002 Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt -- who beat him in the final of the Halle tournament last Sunday.

Three-time runner-up Roddick will open against fellow American Rajeev Ram while Andy Murray will take on Jan Hajek of the Czech Republic.

Scot Murray is attempting to become Britain's first men's singles champion since Fred Perry in 1936 and will be the total focus of home support.

For the first time in the tournament's history, no English player has made the main draw for the men's singles after the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) imposed tougher qualification criteria on wild cards.

In the women's singles, a wildcard has been awarded to 16-year-old Briton Laura Robson and the 2008 Wimbledon Junior Girls' champion has been handed a tough test against fourth seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia.

Defending women's champion and top seed Serena Williams has been drawn in the first round against Michelle Larcher de Brito of Portugal.

Williams has 2004 champion Maria Sharapova and French Open runner-up Samantha Stosur in her half of the draw while her sister and second seed Venus Williams could face Belgians Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin.
