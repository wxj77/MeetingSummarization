(CNN) -- Patrice Evra has failed in his appeal against a five-match supension from the French national team.

The French Football Federation imposed the ban for Evra's part in the France squad's training boycott during the World Cup finals in South Africa.

Manchester United left-back Evra, who was captain of the side, contested the suspension but on Thursday, his punishment was upheld by the FFF appeals  commission.

An FFF statement read: "The superior appeals commission, which met today to consider the appeal by Patrick Evra, decided to uphold the sanction of five matches of non-selection for the France team handed down on August 17 by the federal disciplinary commission.

Evra's lawyer Jean-Yves Foucard told reporters: "Patrice Evra wanted to express himself, which he did at great length, and the commission listened to him very attentively, and asked good questions.

"Patrice explained that he fulfilled his role with transparency and honesty, always trying to smooth the differences between the players and the staff, and particularly the coach. You can understand, you can imagine that these relationships were not simple."

Evra was one of four players banned following France's World Cup debacle in which they failed to qualify for the last 16 of the competition, collecting just one point in three matches.

Nicolas Anelka, who was sent home after a row with coach Raymond Domenech was handed an 18-match suspension, while Franck Ribery received three and Jeremy Toulalan a single game.

Only Evra appealed against his ban and the result means that he is not eligible to play for France until their friendly match against Brazil in February.
