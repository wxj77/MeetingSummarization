(CNN) -- A jet crashed Sunday near Freeport, a city on the island of Grand Bahama, killing all nine people on board, authorities said.

The flight originated from Nassau, the capital, according to a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration, which said it will investigate.

The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.

Inspector Terecita Pinder of the Royal Bahamas Police Force confirmed that all those on board died. Police have not released their identities.

According to Andrew Young, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Myles and Ruth Munroe were among the victims.

Myles Munroe is the senior pastor of Bahamas Faith Ministries International Fellowship, that group's website says. His wife, Ruth, serves as co-pastor.

"Ambassador Young expresses his deep sadness over the tragic death of his friends Dr. Myles and Mrs. Ruth Munroe. He offers condolences to the Munroe family and the families of the other souls who lost their lives as a result of this shocking plane crash," the Andrew Young Foundation said in a statement.

Young is a scheduled speaker at a conference starting Monday in Freeport.

But the Global Leadership Forum will continue this week, according to Munroe's organization.

"On behalf of Myles Munroe International and ITWLA. We would like to inform you that the Global Leadership Forum will continue," Myles Munroe International posted on its Facebook page. "This is what Dr. Munroe would have wanted."

The ITWLA is International Third World Leaders Association, which was founded by Munroe.
