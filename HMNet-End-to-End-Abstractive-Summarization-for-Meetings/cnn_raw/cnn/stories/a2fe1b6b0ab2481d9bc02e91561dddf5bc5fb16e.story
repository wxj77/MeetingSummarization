(CNN) -- Australia's Marc Leishman and Sergio Garcia of Spain were the leaders after the first day of play at the Masters in Augusta.

Garcia hit six birdies in his opening round to finish six under par with a round of 66, a benchmark which Leishman, who had gone out earlier, had already set.

Tipped by many to win his first major since 2008, Tiger Woods shot a two-under 70, which is the same opening score as in three of his four victories at Augusta.

"It's a good start," Woods said. "Some years some guys shot 65 starting out here, but right now I'm only four back and I'm right there.

"We've got a long way to go. You just go out there and play shot for shot."

In many ways though, the day belonged to 14-year-old Guan Tianlang.

The Chinese schoolboy not only set the record as the youngest player to ever compete at the Masters, he then followed that up with a round of one-over par.

Tianlang, who beat the previous record held by Italy's Matteo Manassero, who was nearly 17 when he set the previous mark in 2010, bogeyed his first but responded swiftly with a birdie at the third.

He finished with a putt off the green that sunk into the hole at the 18th to earn applause and acclaim from spectators and fellow competitors.

Meanwhile, Welshman Jamie Donaldson also earned himself a place in the Augusta record books after hitting a hole-in-one at the sixth, only the fifth player in the competition's 77-year history to achieve the feat.

With a heavy thunderstorm expected overnight that will soften the greens, Woods warned "the golf course is going to be very different" on Friday.

Elsewhere, three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson carded a one under par 71, while young Northern Irish star Rory McIlroy went round in 72.

However defending champion Bubba Watson faces a uphill battle to defend his title after he struggled to a 75 -- leaving him nine strokes off the pace already.
