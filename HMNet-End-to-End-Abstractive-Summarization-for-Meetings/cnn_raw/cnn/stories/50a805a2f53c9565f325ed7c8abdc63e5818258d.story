(CNN) -- The forthcoming season of MotoGP will carry an extra dash of glamour after socialite Paris Hilton announced she is to launch her own team.

The American heir to the Hilton hotels fortune has joined forces with the BQR set-up to form her own 125cc team, which will be called SuperMartxé VIP by Paris Hilton.

It will comprise of Spanish riders Sergio Gadea and Maverick Viñales with legendary mechanic Rossano Brazzi, who has worked with six-time MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi among others, taking care of the technical details.

Hilton posted a link to the story on her official Twitter page on Tuesday saying: "This is going to be fun!" and an earlier Tweet read: "I love motorcycles."

Both riders will be present at the launch in Madrid this weekend, alongside Hilton and her partners Nano, Xavi Montero and Ricard Garriga.

The 125cc category is the entry level competition in MotoGP. The 250cc category is now called Moto2, while the top level MotoGP is 500cc.

SuperMartxé VIP is a dance-party series that hosts club nights in Spain. Hilton has starred in a music video to promote their events, and now their name will appear with hers on the team's livery.

Hilton is the latest in a long line of celebrities to get involved with motorbikes. Earlier this year film star Antonio Banderas supported a MotoGP team but it has recently collapsed after its major sponsor pulled out.
