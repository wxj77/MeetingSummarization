Atlanta (CNN) -- After a month-long investigation, Clark Atlanta University lifted a self-imposed suspension on the school's marching band after finding no evidence of hazing.

The university announced August 30 that all performances of its Mighty Marching Panthers Band would be temporarily halted so the school could investigate allegations of hazing within its ranks.

Clark Atlanta conducted an "aggressive and thorough investigation" and found there was "neither hazing nor any illegal activity," the school said in a statement Tuesday.

Allegations of misconduct within marching bands have garnered national attention after a hazing ritual resulted in the death of Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion, 26, last November.

FAMU's band director retired in the wake of the scandal and the school's president resigned.

Champion, who was from Decatur, Georgia, just outside Atlanta, died after being beaten during a hazing ritual on a band bus after a FAMU football game.

Both FAMU and Clark Atlanta are historically black colleges. Another, North Carolina Central University, suspended its marching band's drum line for two weeks in September after an investigation into allegations of hazing found that all members of the line had violated the school's code of conduct.

According to the Herald-Sun newspaper in Durham, the school is ordering drum line members to attend a hazing prevention workshop and perform community service.

And Texas Southern University suspended its "Ocean of Soul" band last week to investigate a possible hazing incident involving a section of the band.
