(CNN) -- An 11-year-old Pennsylvania boy is missing in Egypt, according to the boy's family.

The family says that the boy's Egyptian father abducted him.

A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Cairo, meanwhile, says U.S. authorities are "aware of the situation" and are assisting the boy's mother in her search efforts.

Stephano Khalil Mohamed Atteya, or Nikko as he is called by his family, went to Egypt with his mother and her sister to visit his father, who lives there, according to a missing person report from the Pennsylvania State Police in Harrisburg. The boy was last seen August 1 with his father, the boy's family said.

The father sped off with the boy in a car after forcing the boy's mother and aunt from the car, the family said.

"They heard (Nikko) screaming from the window, calling for his mom," said Nikko's aunt, Olga Panagos, who lives in Fayetteville, Pennsylvania. "That's the last time they saw him."

Nikko's father, an Egyptian citizen, requested that his son come to Egypt to meet his grandmother and attend his father's sister's wedding, American relatives said.

The U.S. Embassy in Cairo is working with Nikko's mother, who is still in Cairo, and with local authorities to help locate the boy, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Colton.

The boy's parents were married in 1999 and divorced in 2005; Nikko was their only child together and was born in the United States, according to Panagos.

"The family is very stressed. We have no idea where Nikko is," Panagos said.

Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, also is working with the family to provide any appropriate assistance, according to Casey spokeswoman April Melody.

CNN's Leigh Remizowski, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.
