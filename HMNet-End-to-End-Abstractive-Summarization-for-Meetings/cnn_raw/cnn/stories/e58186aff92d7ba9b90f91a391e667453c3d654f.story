(Mashable) -- A Facebook phishing attack is on the loose this weekend -- the third widespread attack on the site in the past three weeks.

The attack attempts to steal your Facebook login credentials, install malware on your computer, and even get your home address.

The attack is spread via a "hilarious video" posted to Facebook walls, reports WebSense -- when clicked, a form appears requesting your Facebook login.

The attack then returns you to Facebook, installs an app called "Media Player HD," and asks you to download the "FLV player" -- doing so installs malware on your machine.

It gets worse: Depending on your location, you may also be presented with a contest to win an iPad ... if you just enter your home address.

To avoid getting caught, simply remove the "hilarious video" if you find it on your Facebook wall.

If you see it elsewhere on Facebook, don't click it ... and of course remember the obvious rule: Don't enter your Facebook login anywhere other than Facebook.com.

If you already fell for the attack, change your Facebook password, uninstall the Facebook app (often called "Media Player HD"), and run a virus/malware scan on your computer.
