(CNN) -- Actress Kathy Bates is recovering after having a double mastectomy, a publicist confirmed Wednesday.

Bates, nominated for an Emmy for her lead role in the TV drama series "Harry's Law," was diagnosed with breast cancer two months ago, the actress tweeted.

Her publicist said she hasn't had to undergo chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

"I don't miss my breasts as much as I miss Harry's Law. ;-) Thanks for all the sweet tweets. Y'all kept me going," Bates tweeted.

Bates, 64, is best known for winning an Academy Award for Best Actress in the 1991 movie "Misery."

She earned Academy Award nominations as Best Supporting Actress for "Primary Colors" and "About Schmidt."

The Emmy Awards are September 23. Bates also is nominated in the Outstanding Guest Actress category for a guest appearance on the comedy "Two and a Half Men."

Bates battled ovarian cancer in 2004.
