(CNN) -- With its wonky arguments about taxes and health care, Wednesday's presidential debate may not have been the most riveting 90 minutes of the 2012 campaign.

But the faceoff between President Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney produced no shortage of humor on Twitter, where observers cracked jokes about everything from Romney's perceived swipe at "Sesame Street's" Big Bird to Jim Lehrer's passive moderating style.

By the end of the debate, both @FiredBigBird and @SilentJimLehrer were newly minted Twitter accounts with thousands of followers. And Twitter reported 10.3 million tweets during the debate, making it "the most tweeted-about event in U.S. politics."

But many people on Twitter just thought the debate was boring.
