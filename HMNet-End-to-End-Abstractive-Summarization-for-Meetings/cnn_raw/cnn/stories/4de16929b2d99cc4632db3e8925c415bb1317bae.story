(CNN) -- A Massachusetts woman is calling Lt. Gov. Tim Murray a hero for helping her two grandchildren to safety after the minivan in which they were riding caught fire.

Murray was driving Tuesday evening in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he lives, according to a statement from the governor's office.

"[He] noticed a parked minivan with a tire on fire. The Lt. Governor pulled over, dialed 911, and as he was doing so, heard a nearby individual scream that there were children in the vehicle," according to the statement. "The Lt. Governor approached the vehicle and helped the children get out safely to their grandmother, who was nearby."

Firefighters extinguished the fire.

"The Lt. Governor is happy that everyone is safe," the statement said.

Ruth-Ann Manozzi told CNN Boston affiliate WHDH she had pulled over to pick up a friend.

As Manozzi got out of the minivan to inform her friend of her arrival, Murray drove by and noticed her tire was on fire, the station reported.

According to Manozzi, the fire was spreading and Murray, a former mayor of the city, dumped a pail of water on the tire.

His rescue attempt frightened the minivan occupants at first, however.

"And there's this man trying to force open the car door, and the kids are locking it. The first thing you think is someone's trying to get into your car," Manozzi told WHDH. "I was gonna smack him. I yelled, 'Get away from my car!' " said Manozzi.

Murray, who helped pull the children out of the minivan after they unlocked the doors, downplayed his actions Wednesday.

"I'm lucky she didn't punch me in the nose," Murray said. "Like any good grandmother, she was worried about her kids' safety."
