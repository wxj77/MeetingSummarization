(CNN) -- Man of the moment Andy Murray needed less than an hour to book his place in the quarterfinals of the Japan Open in Tokyo Wednesday.

The defending champion beat Lukas Lacko of Slovakia 6-1 6-2 in 57 minutes at the Ariake Coliseum to book a clash against Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka in the last eight.

It was the Scot's ninth win in a row after his U.S. Open triumph where he beat Novak Djokovic in the final in New York.

Murray also won singles gold in the London Olympics, defeating Wawrinka on the way to his triumph at Wimbledon.

The World No.3 was on control from the start against Lacko, breaking him twice on the way to taking the opening set and then continuing the good work in the second.

"I began the match very well, which was nice because it was long day to get on," Murray told the official ATP Tour website.

"I started the match almost perfect. That was important. Once I got the break in the second set, I started to play better."

Murray holds a 7-4 winning career record against Wawrinka, who beat Jeremy Chardy of France 7-6 6-7 7-5 in a tight last 16 encounter.

Meanwhile, top seed Djokovic eased through his second round match at the China Open in Beijing.

Like Murray, the Serbian is playing in his first tournament since Flushing Meadows, and wasted little time in beating Argentina's Carlos Berlocq in straight sets.

Djokovic, who struggled past Germany's Michael Berrer in the first round, broke his opponent six times on his way to a 6-1 6-3 victory in one hour and 14 minutes.

In the accompanying WTA tournament at the same venue, Russia's Maria Sharapova began with a 6-2 6-2 win over Romania's Sorana Cirstea.

But Serbian pair Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic were third round casualties, losing to Romina Oprandi and Carla Suarez-Navarro respectively.
