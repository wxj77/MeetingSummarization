(CNN) -- A 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck Friday night 41 km (26 miles) north-northwest of San Jose, Costa Rica, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.

Journalist Djenane Villanueva in San Jose told CNN she felt the earthquake, that it was long, but that she had not received any immediate reports of damage or injuries.

The incident occurred at 7:54 p.m. (9:54 p.m. ET) at a depth of 98 km (61 miles), USGS said.

"It was strong," said Esteban Solis Mora, a telephone operator at the Real Hotel and Club Tower, near the center of San Jose. He said he felt at least three shocks over a period of about three minutes, but said he could see no damage and was aware of no injuries.
