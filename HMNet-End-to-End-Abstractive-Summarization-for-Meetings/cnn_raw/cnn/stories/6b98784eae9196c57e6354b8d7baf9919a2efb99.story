Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Seven civilians were killed Monday from two separate roadside mines in Afghanistan's eastern Ghazni province, the Ministry of Interior said.

The first attack occurred in the Qara Bagh district of Ghazni province, the ministry said. A roadside mine struck a civilian vehicle and killed four civilians, including two children.

The second incident took place in the center of Ghazni city when a civilian vehicle hit a roadside mine, the ministry said. Three civilians were killed.

In a statement, the ministry said it "strongly condemns these acts of the enemies of peace and stability and expresses its sincere condolences to the families of the victims."

On Sunday, the ministry said an 8-year-old girl was killed by "Afghanistan enemies" who gave her a remote-controlled explosive in a bag and told her to give it to police officers in Oruzgan province on Friday.

"When the girl (approached) the police vehicle, the enemies detonated the mine by remote control and killed the girl," the ministry said. No police officials were injured.
