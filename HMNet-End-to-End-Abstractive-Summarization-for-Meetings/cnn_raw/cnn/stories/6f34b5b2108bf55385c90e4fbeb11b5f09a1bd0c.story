New York (CNN) -- Kerry Kennedy, the daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy and ex-wife to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was involved in a hit-and-run incident Friday morning while under the influence of drugs, according to the New York State Police.

"911 calls reported a white vehicle operating in an erratic manner ... that collided with a tractor-trailer," a state police press release said. "The vehicle sustained damage and a flat tire."

Kennedy, 52, was found by state police behind the wheel of her damaged Lexus SUV. "A subsequent investigation found Kennedy to be operating the motor vehicle while her ability was impaired by drugs," police said in announcing the charge against her.

Ken Sunshine, a spokesman for Kennedy, denied that she was on drugs, noting Kennedy "voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests -- all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system. The charges were filed before the test results were available."

Kennedy was issued several traffic tickets and is scheduled to appear in court in North Castle on Tuesday.
