(CNN)Make it so. Or better yet, make it stop.

Sir Patrick Stewart, perhaps most widely known for his role as Captain Jean-Luc Picard on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," showed off his stage chops on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" this week in a skit about pesky plane passengers.

Among the portrayed offenses, which were compiled from Expedia's 2014 Airplane Etiquette Study, Stewart feasted on a day-old tuna sandwich and a slice of Camembert cheese as the "stinky snacker" before violating all concepts of personal space as the "seat climber."

The 74-year-old British thespian was promoting a new film, "Match," which opened on Thursday.

Here's the full list of Expedia's findings, which surveyed 1,000 Americans on what they considered the most annoying in-flight behavior.

1. Rear seat-kicker (67%)

2. Inattentive parents (64%)

3. Aromatic passenger (56%)

4. Audio-insensitive (talking/music) (51%)

5. Boozer (50%)

6. Chatty Cathy (43%)

7. Carry-on baggage offenders (39%)

8. Armrest hog (38%)

9. Seat-back guy (aka seat recliner) (37%)

10. Queue jumper (35%)

11. Overhead bin inconsiderate (32%)

12. Pungent foodies (32%)

13. Back-of-seat grabber (31%)

14. Playboy (reads/watches adult content) (30%)

15. Amorous (inappropriate affection) (29%)

16. Mad bladder (28%)

17. Undresser (removes shoes or more) (26%)

18. Seat switcher (13%)
