Atlanta (CNN)Almost three weeks after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub, Bobbi Kristina Brown is still fighting for her life.

Doctors have removed her breathing tube, two sources close to the family told CNN on Thursday, one day after the procedure supposedly took place.

Brown, daughter of late singing star Whitney Houston, will now be ventilated through a hole in her throat.

"This is an indication that the patient will need this for weeks and months to come, as opposed to hours and days," said CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

He said the move lowers the risk of infection and is standard procedure.

Brown, 21, remains in a medically induced coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Doctors are attempting to slowly lift her coma, according to sources close to the family.

The extent of her injuries is not known.

Police have said they're treating Brown's case as a criminal investigation. She was found  in a bathtub full of water on January 31 at her Roswell, Georgia, residence.

Her mother, who died in 2012, was similarly found in a bathtub, just hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party.  A coroner ruled Houston's death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors.

Brown is her only child.

CNN's MaryLynn Ryan, Sunny Hostin and Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.
