(CNN)A photo of what appeared to be a homeless person reading a copy of Vogue has been deleted from the Instagram account of the style editor who posted it amid criticism that it showed how "out of touch" she is.

Vogue style editor-at-large Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis, a member of German royalty who has been with the magazine since 2012, posted the photo Saturday from Paris, where she is covering fashion week.

"Paris is full of surprises....and @voguemagazine readers even in unexpected corners!" the caption read.

Style news website Fashionista, which first reported on the picture, called it the latest example showing how "disturbingly out of touch" she is.

"... The things she writes, both in Vogue and on social media, often straddle the line between entertaining/aspirational and disturbingly out of touch. On Saturday she crossed that line," the article said.

Some commenters on the photo appeared to agree, calling the photo "shameful," "cruel" and "in poor taste."

In response, von Thurn und Taxis, who often goes by "TNT," posted the comment: "Why cruel? The person to me is as dignified as anyone else!"

Others started coming to her defense, saying there was nothing wrong with the photo, before it disappeared from her feed about five hours after it was posted.

Vogue and TNT did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.  Do you think the photo crossed the line? Let us know on this Facebook post.
