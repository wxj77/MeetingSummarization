(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal continued his winning ways on clay as he reached the quarterfinals of the Barcelona Open with a 6-3 6-1 win over Colombia's Santiago Giraldo on Thursday.

The Spaniard's serve was surprisingly broken early by his 54th-ranked opponent, but from 3-3 he dominated the match to set up a clash with French seventh seed Gael Monfils.

The 24-year-old has now won 31 consecutive matches on his favored surface, with his last defeat inflicted by Robin Soderling at the 2009 French Open. He already holds the record on clay for his 81-match winning run from 2005-07.

Nadal missed last year's event in the Catalan capital but won the title the previous five years, and now has a record there of 27-1. He has a tour-leading 26 match victories this season -- two ahead of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, who are not in the draw.

Nadal begins Barcelona bid in style

"I will be playing against one of best players in the world who has reached the semifinals at Roland Garros, so it will be a tough match," Nadal said of Friday's clash with Monfils.

The 24-year-old Monfils, who reached the last four at the French Open in 2008, moved into the last eight with a 6-4 7-6 (9-7) victory over ninth-seeded compatriot Richard Gasquet.

Monfils, ranked ninth, lost in the last 16 at Monte Carlo in his first match in two months following a wrist injury suffered in San Jose which meant he could not take the court for his semifinal in the U.S. event.

Fourth seed David Ferrer, who lost to Nadal in the final in the principality on Sunday, reached the last eight with a 6-3 6-2 win over Romania's Victor Hanescu.

The 29-year-old next faces a rematch with Jurgen Melzer, who he beat in the semis on Saturday.

The Austrian sixth seed progressed after coming from behind to beat Ferrer's 11th-seeded compatriot Albert Montanes 6-7 (2-7) 6-3 6-2.

The winner of Friday's Ferrer-Melzer clash will face a Spaniard in the semifinals, with veteran Juan Carlos Ferrero and Nicolas Almagro also going through.

Former world No. 1 Ferrero, playing his first event since last September's U.S. Open following wrist and knee surgery, battled past Italy's Simone Vagnozzi 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 6-4.

The 31-year-old won this tournament in 2001 and was runner-up four years later when Nadal embarked on his streak of titles.

Eighth seed Almagro ended the hopes of former world No. 3 Nikolay Davydenko, beating the the 29-year-old Russian 7-6 (7-2) 6-3.

Almagro, 25, won two lower-level events on clay in South America in February before losing a final in Mexico.

Another Spaniard, Feliciano Lopez, continued his country's dominance by joining Nadal, Ferrer, Ferrero and Almagro in the last eight.

The 29-year-old left-hander beat Japan's Kei Nishikori 6-4 7-6 (7-5) to set up a clash with Croatia's 56th-ranked Ivan Dodic, who knocked out young Canadian 15th seed 7-6 (7-0) 4-6 6-3.

Meanwhile, women's No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki marched into the semifinals of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart after a 6-4 6-1 win over home hope Andrea Petkovic on Thursday.

The German, ranked 19th, led 4-2 in the opening set but Wozniacki fought back to avenge last month's defeat at the Miami Masters.

The 20-year-old Dane will next play Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, who beat German wild-card entry Kristina Barrois 7-5 6-3..

Last year's runner-up Samantha Stosur also reached the last four as the fifth seed upset world No. 3 Vera Zvonareva, beating the Russian 2-6 6-3 7-6 (7-3) in two and a half hours.

The Australian, losing finalist in last year's French Open, will next face Julia Gorges -- who beat fellow German Sabine Lisicki 6-4 6-4.
