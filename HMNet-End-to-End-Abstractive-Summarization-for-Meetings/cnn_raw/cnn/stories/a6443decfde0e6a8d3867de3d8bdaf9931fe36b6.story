(CNN) -- It's fair to say that the year in music has been one filled with surprises.

Justin Timberlake made his return to music last the entire year, while Eminem's comeback with "The Marshall Mathers LP 2" was more impromptu.

Kanye West went left with "Yeezus" while Jay Z tried to upset the way albums are released -- only to be upstaged by his wife, Beyonc√©, mere months later.

And when CNN readers chose as their favorites of 2013, there were surprises there as well. Where 2012 was dominated by artists who were carried on the strength of one song -- Carly Rae Jepsen, Gotye and Psy -- 2013 favored the more established, as well as the artists who showed that they had more than a single hit to offer.

At No. 1 was Mr. "Suit & Tie" Justin Timberlake, followed by industry "Treasure" Bruno Mars and an enlightened Katy Perry. There were still a few artists who shone brightly thanks to a boost from a particular song -- such as Lorde with "Royals" and Robin Thicke with "Blurred Lines" -- but even those musicians have much more to offer beyond those undeniable hits of 2013.

Dare we say it, but could 2013 have been the year of the album? We think it looks like CNN readers voted that way.
