Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- In his latest run-in with the law, rap music mogul Marion "Suge" Knight was arrested at a suburban Los Angeles outdoor shopping mall for failing to appear in court on a traffic violation.

Sgt. Shawn Ruda of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said that police deputies spotted Knight late Friday as he was leaving a restaurant in the Universal CityWalk complex of shops, movie theaters and dining areas, which is located about nine miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

At the time, the co-founder of Death Row Records had a warrant issued for him because he hadn't showed up in court. Knight consented to go with police to the sheriff's department's West Hollywood station, Ruda said.

There, the 45-year-old was booked and issued a citation to appear in court again on the traffic violation. The whole process took about an hour, according to Ruda.

The sheriff's department did not elaborate on the nature of the traffic violation.

Knight rose to fame and fortune after founding his record label in 1991 and bringing in such artists as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Knight was in Las Vegas with Shakur in 1996 when the chart-topping rapper was shot to death.

Shortly thereafter, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time, along with Shakur's death, public feuds between Knight and some rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and others, contributed to the label's ultimate demise and bankruptcy proceedings in 2006.

Last May, Los Angeles police arrested Knight after they say he pointed a gun at a man outside the city.

He was charged then with assault with a deadly weapon involving a firearm and with driving under a suspended license, said the Los Angeles Police Department. His lawyer told CNN that Knight was "100 percent innocent."
