(CNN) -- Miley Cyrus is back on track after a severe allergic reaction put the pop star in the hospital.

The 21-year-old is scheduled to resume her previously postponed "Bangerz" tour in August after being forced to hold off on the remaining performances due to her illness.

Cyrus' new U.S. lineup features nine stops: seven shows to make up for the ones that she missed, plus an additional two concerts for fans in Pittsburgh and Chicago.

Fans who purchased tickets to her April 7 concert in Charlotte, North Carolina; the April 16 show in St. Louis; and the April 15 show in Kansas City, Missouri; will receive full refunds and be able to purchase tickets to her rescheduled dates -- on August 6, August 10 and August 12, respectively -- starting May 2.

Those who purchased tickets to her April concerts in Uniondale, New York; Philadelphia; Nashville; and Louisville will be able to use them for admission to her August shows in those locations.

The "Wrecking Ball" songstress was initially put out of commission in early April with a flu-like illness, which caused her to pull out of her Charlotte show. Yet after being prescribed the antibiotic Cephalexin her health woes only grew worse; an allergic reaction to the drug left Cyrus hospitalized for more than a week, according to a statement from her representative earlier this month.

By April 25 she seemed back to her old self. If her Instagram photos are to be believed, pancakes were a part of her recuperation.

Cyrus' next "Bangerz" stop will be Amsterdam, as she kicks off the European leg of her tour on Friday.
