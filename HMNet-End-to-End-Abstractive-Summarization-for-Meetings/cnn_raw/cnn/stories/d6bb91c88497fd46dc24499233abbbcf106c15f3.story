(CNN) -- The Mexican Football Federation has banned eight players from taking part at next month's Copa America tournament in Argentina after they were caught bringing women back to the team hotel.

The octet were suspended for sixth months and fined more than $4,000 each following the incident after a friendly match in Quito, Ecuador, on Saturday.

Jonathan dos Santos, a reserve-team player for European champions Barcelona, was banned along with Mexico-based Israel Jimenez, Nestor Vidrio, Marco Fabian, Jorge Hernandez, Javier Cortes, Nestor Calderon and David Cabrera.

"The players already confessed and are full of remorse. They have apologized to the team, the supporters, the technical commission, and to the federation and have said they'll take responsibility for their actions," Mexican federation director Hector Gonzalez Inarritu told reporters at a press conference in Mexico City.

Mexico moved up to ninth place in the world rankings after beating the United States in Saturday's Gold Cup final, returning to the top-10 for the first time since July 2007.
