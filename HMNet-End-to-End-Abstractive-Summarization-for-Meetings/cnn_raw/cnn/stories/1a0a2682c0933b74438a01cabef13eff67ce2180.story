(CNN) -- Australia's new captain Michael Clarke admits that he will have to earn the respect of the nation's cricket fans after being confirmed as the successor to Ricky Ponting on Wednesday.

The 36-year-old Ponting stood down as skipper of Australia's Test and one-day teams on Tuesday following last week's World Cup quarterfinal exit, but will continue as a batsman after being named in the 14-man squad to tour Bangladesh next month.

Clarke has long been groomed as Ponting's successor, having filled in when his captain was unavailable or being rested, but acknowledges that he is not the most popular choice to replace him.

"I don't know the exact reasons why it's there, but it is and I've had it probably my whole career," he told the Cricket Australia website.

When cricket means more than just a match

"So I certainly don't sit here and think that I can get the whole of this country to like me. People are always going to have their own views, but for me it's about respect.

"It's about earning that respect, leading the team in the right way, playing cricket in the right manner and hopefully I can earn the respect of the doubters that are out there."

Ponting was one of the most successful captains in modern cricket, having led Australia to victory at the 2003 and 2007 World Cups before last week's defeat by India.

Clarke, who turns 30 on Sunday, said he was happy to have Ponting in the team for the short trip to Bangladesh, which comprises three one-day internationals in Dhaka from April 9-13.

"Bangladesh is going to be a great test for that, to see how it all unfolds," he said.

"I know he will allow me to do my job to the best of my ability, I have a very good working relationship with 'Punter' and I'm confident that if he can continue to play as well as he has done for such a long time, I'm certain it can work."
