Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- CNN talk show host Larry King and his wife, Shawn King, each filed for divorce Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court.

Both cited "irreconcilable differences" in their filings, but they disagreed over custody of the two children from the 12 years of marriage.

He wants to share legal and physical custody of the boys with her, but she is asking the court to grant physical custody to her alone.

The Kings have two sons, ages 9 and 11.

"His major concern is for the children and beyond that he will have no further comment," Larry King's publicist said in a written statement.

Shawn King's lawyer did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

The documents said the couple separated on Tuesday, the same day Shawn King signed her papers. Larry King's signature was dated Wednesday. Both petitions were filed Wednesday.

Each is asking that they not be ordered to pay spousal support to the other, and they both want the other to pay their attorney fees.

While his filing offers little detail about what marital property he will claim, her petition lists the Beverly Hills, California, home where the couple has resided for the past two years and two Utah houses.

Larry King asked the court to declare any "purported transmutation agreement" to be "null, void and unenforceable." California law provides for marital contracts, known as transmutation agreements, to designate ownership of certain property between spouses.

When Larry King, 76, married Shawn Engemann Southwick, 50, on September 5, 1997, it was his eighth marriage to seven women.

King has hosted a nightly prime time talk show on CNN since June 1985. He hosted a late night national radio talk show before joining CNN.
