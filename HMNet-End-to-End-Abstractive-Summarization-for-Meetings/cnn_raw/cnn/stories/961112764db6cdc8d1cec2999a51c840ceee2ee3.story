Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants beheaded six Afghan police officers during a raid in northern Baghlan province, officials said Wednesday.

The militants had attacked a school, clinic and the district governor's office in Dahanah-e Ghori. They overran a police checkpoint and killed the six police officers, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Munshi Abdul Majid, the governor of Baghlan.

In all, eight police officers were at the checkpoint, Munshi said. They defended themselves for two hours during the skirmish before the beheadings.

The grisly incident occurred Tuesday in a province that had until recently been largely spared from violence and on the same day that participants at an international donors conference in Kabul agreed that Afghan forces should take over security for the troubled nation by 2014.

"This incident once again demonstrates the brutal, barbaric and senseless acts committed by the Taliban," said Col. Rafael Torres, an ISAF spokesman. "We remain committed to serving alongside our Afghan partners to improve security and development for all Afghans."

Two ISAF servicemembers died after an insurgent attack Tuesday in southern Afghanistan, an ISAF statement said Wednesday.

On Wednesday, another international coalition forces service member died in a bombing in southern Afghanistan, an ISAF statement said.
