(CNN) -- Six degrees of separation, that's all there is between any two people on the planet. At least that's what some would have you believe. Others would tell you that no person is ever more than six steps away from Kevin Bacon.

With two of the biggest sporting events on the planet set to get under way in New Jersey and Russia in the next few days, CNN has put that theory to the test -- and bettered it.

Sadly there's no Kevin Bacon (trust me, I tried) but above are some of the more obscure links between the National Football League's biggest game and the Winter Olympics.
