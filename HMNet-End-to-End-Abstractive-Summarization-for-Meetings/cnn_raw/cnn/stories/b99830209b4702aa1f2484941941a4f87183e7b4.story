(CNN)  -- Novak Djokovic extended his winning run to 23 matches with a 6-3 6-1 victory over American Mardy Fish to reach the final of the Masters 1000 tournament in Miami Friday.

The Australian Open champion will play either Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer, who were playing in the night session, in Sunday's final.

The Serbian beat world number one Nadal to claim the prestigious Indian Wells crown last month.

The world number two saved two break points as Fish made a strong start, but after a brief rain delay it was Djokovic who seized the initiative with an immediate break of service.

"I told Mardy at the end I got saved by the rain," Djokovic told the official ATP Tour website.

"It really seemed like that. After I went back to the locker room I had 45 minutes to get it together and I felt much better after I came back to the court."

14th seed Fish, who has succeeded Andy Roddick as the highest placed American in the rankings, was unable to respond as Djokovic closed out the opening set.

He was broken immediately at the start of the second set and a further break in the fifth game left him no way back.

The 23-year-old Djokovic eventually closed out victory in just 90 minutes as he continued his superlative start to 2011.

In other tennis news Friday, Britain's Andy Murray has confirmed that doubles specialist Ross Hutchins will be his new coach from the Barcelona Open later this month.

Murray, who was beaten by Djokovic in the Australian Open final, has gone out in the first round of his last three tournaments since the grand slam.

The world number five has been without a coach since parting company with Miles Maclagan in July of last year.
