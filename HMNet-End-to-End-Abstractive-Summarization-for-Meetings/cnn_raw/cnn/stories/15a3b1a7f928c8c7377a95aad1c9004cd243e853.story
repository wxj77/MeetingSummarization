(CNN) -- Spain's Dani Pedrosa continued his hot streak by claiming pole for the Italian MotoGP Saturday on his Repsol Honda.

Pedrosa, who won last weekend's German round of the championship, clocked one minute 47.284 seconds on the Mugello circuit to edge out compatriot Jorge Lorenzo on his Yamaha.

It was the 26-year-old Pedrosa's 21st pole in MotoGP and he benefited from a mechanical problem with Lorenzo's bike at the end of the session.

On his last flying lap, Lorenzo came to a halt and had to settle for second quickest.

"I had engine problems in the final corners and I had to stop," said Lorenzo, who leads Pedrosa by 26 points in the title standings.

"We have to correct this problem before tomorrow," he told the official MotoGP website.

Reigning champion Casey Stoner, who crashed out in Germany on the last lap when in second place, could only manage fifth place behind teammate Pedrosa.

It left the way clear for Hector Barbera of Spain on his Ducati to take third on the grid and start on the front row Sunday with Pedrosa and Lorenzo.

Nicky Hayden of the United States was fourth fastest, outqualfying his Ducati teammate Valentino Rossi, who was only 10th best.

Pedrosa was delighted with his performance, but warned that he faced tough opposition from Lorenzo in particular on race day.

"I'm quite happy with the set up of my bike, we've had better grip today and I'm pretty confident.

"But we have to keep very focused and push at the maximum because Lorenzo has an incredible pace."
