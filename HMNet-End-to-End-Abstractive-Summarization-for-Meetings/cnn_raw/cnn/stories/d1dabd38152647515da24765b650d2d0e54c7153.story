(CNN) -- Israeli police on Friday dropped age restrictions at the Temple Mount, allowing Muslims of all ages to pray at the holy site.

But police said they would keep their "high alert status" at the Al-Aqsa mosque.

The age restrictions were lifted after a Thursday night meeting in Amman, Jordan, between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Jordanian King Abdullah and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.

The Temple Mount in Jerusalem is the holiest site in Judaism and the third-holiest site in Islam. Jews call it the Temple Mount, and Muslims know it as Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary.

The Temple Mount has been a flashpoint for violence, and in recent weeks, entry has been limited to women and men above the age of 35. Authorities feared that younger men and teens would cause disturbances.

CNN's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.
