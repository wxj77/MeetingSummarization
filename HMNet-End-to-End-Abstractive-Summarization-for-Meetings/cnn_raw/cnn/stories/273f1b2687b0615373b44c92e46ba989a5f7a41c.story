Los Angeles (CNN) -- Amanda Bynes is "making great strides towards recovery" from mental illness, her parents said Monday.

The actress has been moved from UCLA Medical Center, where she had been treated since late July, to a private treatment facility outside Los Angeles for "specialized treatment," the statement from Rick and Lynn Bynes said. The transfer was recommended "by the skilled health care professionals at UCLA," they said.

Bynes, 27, was placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold two months ago after she was involved in a disturbance in a residential neighborhood in Thousand Oaks, California.

Her mother was granted conservatorship over her daughter under a California mental health law. She has since dropped her petition for conservatorship in probate court "in an effort not to duplicate conservator rights," the statement said.

The actress, who got her start on Nickelodeon with programs "All That" and "The Amanda Show," faces three misdemeanor charges relating to an incident involving a bong allegedly tossed from her Manhattan apartment in May.

In addition, she also has a DUI case pending in Southern California, while a pair of separate hit-and-run charges against her were dismissed last year.
