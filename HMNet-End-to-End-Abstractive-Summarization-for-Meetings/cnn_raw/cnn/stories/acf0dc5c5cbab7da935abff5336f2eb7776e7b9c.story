Paris (CNN)It's a tiger's tail.

That's what French citizens say they saw Thursday in woods and other areas not far from Disneyland Paris, according to a local official.

While authorities haven't managed to corner the animal, all witnesses identified it as a tiger, according to Cédric Tartaud-Gineste, mayoral cabinet director in Montévrain. The town's Facebook page indicates the animal is young.

Montévrain Mayor Christian Robache told CNN affiliate BFM that authorities believe the tiger was domesticated, though an investigation is ongoing.

As the hunt for the cat continues, local residents were told to stay inside and, if they have to go out, to drive rather than walk.

Both Chessy and Montévrain are adjacent to the Disney amusement park, which is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Paris.

Yet there was no mention of the feline on the Disneyland Paris Twitter page, and park spokeswoman Cathy Pianon said the park's security team -- while it was working closely with local authorities -- was never asked to reinforce their security.

Pianon said operations weren't being affected at the park, which she described as closed and well guarded.
