(CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan is officially a free woman.

A source close to the actress confirmed to HLN that Lohan, 27, has finished a court-ordered 90-day stay in rehab.

Her next step is to spend a few days with a sobriety coach to ease her transition -- something that Lohan decided for herself, the source noted.

The actress was smiling as she exited a California rehabilitation center, and the source with knowledge of her situation confirmed that she's doing great.

Lohan's latest rehab stint was taken as an alternative to three months of jail time for two misdemeanor convictions and a shoplifting probation violation finding in March.

The actress told Piers Morgan ahead of her treatment that she's been mandated by the court to go to rehab six times, with her previous stay occurring in 2010. "I could write the book on rehab," Lohan told Morgan, although she said she approached this round with optimism.

"I look at it as a good thing," she said in May. "I can come back afterwards and be fully focused on work."

It's true that work is already waiting for Lohan. The actress has signed up to guest host E!'s "Chelsea Lately" on August 5, and her new movie, "The Canyons," will bow on Friday.

She also signed a deal to sit down with Oprah Winfrey for an exclusive interview that will tape and air in August, in addition to allowing OWN's cameras to tape her post-rehab life for an eight-part docu-series slated to air in 2014.

HLN's Selin Darkalstanian and CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this report.
