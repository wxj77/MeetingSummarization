(CNN) -- The Atlantic Ocean, hurricane-wise, has been relatively quiet this season.

But not the northeastern Pacific.

On Saturday, the 12th storm so far this summer and fall grew to hurricane status -- not threatening anything on land yet, though it would certainly be understandable if folks on the Mexican coast with fresh memories of Hurricane Odile are a little spooked.

As of 2 p.m. (5 p.m. ET), Hurricane Rachel was centered well offshore about 460 miles west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.

It boasted 75 mph sustained winds, an uptick from earlier, as it churned north-northwest at an 8 mph clip. It is expected to continue in this direction, and get a little slower, through Sunday, though "little motion" is expected come Monday.

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect. And there may not be any to come, given it's far from land and has fairly limited movement.

The hurricane center's discussion notes that Rachel "does not have much time to strengthen further, given that it will be moving over gradually cooler waters and into a drier and more stable environment during the next day or so."

The forecast called for the storm to weaken by Sunday afternoon.

Still, even a hint of potential tropical trouble might cause headaches in the region. While the northwest Atlantic and Caribbean have only have had four hurricanes -- Arthur, Bertha, Cristobal and Edouard -- this summer and fall, the northeast Pacific has been a different story.

The region's most recent big hit came compliments of Hurricane Odile.

Less than two weeks ago, Odile snapped palm trees, washed out roads, trashed outdoor markets and damaged facilities, including the Los Cabos airport. Many tourists found themselves stranded in popular Baja California resorts, unable to get anywhere because of the storm.
