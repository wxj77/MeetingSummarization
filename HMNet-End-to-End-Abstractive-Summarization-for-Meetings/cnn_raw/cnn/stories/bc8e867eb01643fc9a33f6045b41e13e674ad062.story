Washington (CNN) -- Consumers are being warned to stop riding all models of the tikit brand of folding bicycles after reports of handlebar stems breaking and injuring riders.

The bikes are manufactured in Eugene, Oregon, by Green Gear Cycling Inc., with the trade name Bike Friday.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the company had received six reports of breaking handlebar stems causing the riders to lose control.

Two people suffered scrapes, bruises and a head laceration that required stitches.

The CPSC said more than 3,800 tikit brand folding bikes in various colors have been sold from January 2007 through September 2012. The Bike Friday tikit brand decal is on the bike frame.

Consumers are urged to contact the bike company to schedule a free repair.
