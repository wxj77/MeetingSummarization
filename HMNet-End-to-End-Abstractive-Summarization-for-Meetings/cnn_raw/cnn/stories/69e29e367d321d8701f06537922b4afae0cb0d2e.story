(CNN) -- To celebrate International Women's Day on March 8, CNN asked you how we can come together to build a more equal world for all.

From women looking to boost female entrepreneurship to fathers seeking equal rights and fair access to education for their daughters, we heard from men and women based all over the world sharing images of their hopes for a better future for women.

To continue the conversation, CNN will also be hosting a TweetChat with Anne-Marie Slaughter, President of the New America Foundation, Noble Peace prize Laureate Tawakkol Karman and Laura Bates, Founder of The Everyday Sexism Project on Friday 7 March at 5pm ET/10pm GMT.

Though much progress has been made on the path to gender equality, more can still be done. So now, we're asking you: "What kind of world do YOU want to build?" Tell us what you are doing and join the conversation by using #CNNwomen.
