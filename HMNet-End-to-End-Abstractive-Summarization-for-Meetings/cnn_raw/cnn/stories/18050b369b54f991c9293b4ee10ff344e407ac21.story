The network is yanking freshman sitcom "Animal Practice" from Wednesday nights next month.

Not only that: The returning NBC comedy that you've all been waiting for finally has a premiere date.

That's right ...

Networks avoid the c-word when making these announcements, but the show's production is being halted after the eighth episode wraps this week (five have aired, three to go).

Last night's "Animal Practice" fell 9 percent to 3.8 million viewers and a 1.0 in the adult demo, ranking as the lowest-rated broadcast show in the hour (including The CW). Lead-out "Guys With Kids," by comparison, at least had 4.3 million and a 1.4 rating.
