(CNN) -- Border patrol agents in Texas arrested singer Fiona Apple after finding marijuana and hashish on her tour bus, authorities said Thursday.

Agents stopped the bus at a checkpoint in Sierra Blanca, Texas, Wednesday night and arrested the singer after a drug-sniffing dog detected controlled substances onboard, the Hudspeth County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Investigators found 0.010 pounds of marijuana and 0.010 pounds of hashish, the statement said.

"Fiona Apple Maggart, freely admitted that the controlled substances belonged to her and she was placed under arrest by U.S. Border Patrol agents and detained," the statement said.

Apple was transported to the Hudspeth County Jail, where she was released on Thursday after posting a $10,000 bond, the statement said.

A representative for Apple declined to comment Thursday.

The sultry-voiced singer first shot to fame in 1997 with her hit single, "Criminal," which earned her a Grammy Award for best female vocal rock performance.

She is currently on tour promoting her new album and was scheduled to perform in Austin on Thursday night.
