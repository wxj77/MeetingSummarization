(CNN) -- With the Grammys going on for 3Â½ hours Sunday night, Trent Reznor thinks the telecast could've spared a few extra minutes for his performance.

The Nine Inch Nails rocker was part of the final closing act at the Grammys -- a set that included Dave Grohl, Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and Josh Homme -- but fans didn't get to see the entire number. The producers decided to cut the group off before they were done and start rolling credits.

"Music's biggest night... to be disrespected," Reznor tweeted after the show. "A heartfelt F*** Y** guys."

Even one of the night's big winners, Macklemore, wasn't happy with the 56th annual Grammy Awards.

Winner's list

The artist, along with collaborator Ryan Lewis, took home four Grammys, including the award for best rap album. That was one honor many predictors thought would go to Kendrick Lamar for "good kid, M.A.A.D. City," but Lamar was completely shut out at the ceremony.

It turns out that Macklemore, too, thought Lamar should've won the prize. On his Instagram account, Macklemore shared a text he sent to his friend.

"You got robbed," Macklemore texted Lamar. "I wanted you to win. You should have. It's weird and sucks that I robbed you."

Macklemore told his Instagram followers that that while he's "honored and completely blown away to win anything, much less four Grammys ... in that category, he should have won IMO."

Guess we'll have to add "good kid, M.A.A.D. City" to our list of classic albums that the Grammys ignored. What do you think? Any other big wins that you want to contest?
