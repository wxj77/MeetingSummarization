(CNN) -- Jason Priestley is ready to spill details about his life in a new memoir.

The 43-year-old actor has landed a deal with HarperCollins' HarperOne imprint to produce a book that will cover his life and career, including the 10 years he spent playing Brandon Walsh on the classic '90s series, "Beverly Hills, 90210."

"This memoir will offer his fans rare insight into the real Jason," HarperOne's executive editor, Nancy Hancock, said in a statement. "It will be a must-have for every '90210' fan on the planet, and a must-read for those wanting to know more about Jason's real life then and today."

According to The Hollywood Reporter, who first reported the news, the actor will delve into his "complicated relationship" with "90210" creator Aaron Spelling and what happened after the series ended with its 10th season in 2000.

It'll also offer insight into Priestley's history with alcohol (he spent five days in jail after a 2000 drunken-driving incident), and a "life-changing" 2002 car crash.

The as-yet-untitled book is scheduled to be released in spring 2014.

"Writing your memoir is no small task. And although I've only been on the planet for 44 years, I've lived a lot in that time," said the actor, who will celebrate his 44th birthday August 28. "I hope my story will enlighten, entertain, and inspire those who read it."
