(CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Kabul is withdrawing its personnel from an Afghan media center, saying it is reviewing and reassessing its relationship.

"We have been planning to transition U.S. personnel and assistance, and that process has begun," said a statement posted Wednesday on the embassy website.

"We want to ensure that U.S. support and resources are used efficiently and effectively as the transition takes place."

The statement did not detail why the embassy decided to pull its personnel, who act as advisers to the Government Media and Information Center. The center is responsible for shaping the government's positions and responses to Afghan news issues.

The Washington Post, citing anonymous Afghan and Western officials, reported that the embassy pulled its advisers amid concerns it had become politicized in recent months.

The newspaper reported, according to officials, that there were concerns about how the media center "has been managed and the allocation of resources."

The embassy said it had no reaction to the Post report.
