Luckily there are some fantastic ways to see the wet face of the planet.

1. Explore the pristine coves of Tierra del Fuego

This journey around the foot of Patagonia is one of the most unusual experiences on earth. The expedition ships of Cruceros Australis bring passengers close to soaring condors, penguin colonies and glaciers.

2. Navigate the Yangtze

There's much more to this great river than the spectacular Three Gorges dam. Victoria Cruises' American ships go all the way from Chongqing to Shanghai, stopping to explore cities like Nanjing and Wuhan.

5. Cruise the Mekong delta

The Wat Phou rice barge takes passengers down the Laos section of the Mekong, showcasing some of the finest sights on the river.

12. Follow the trail of the pharaohs down the Nile

However, the one-day trip at low water between July and February is considered the best white-water experience.

From US$135 per day; www.zambezi.com

14. Kayak from sunset to moonlight in the Florida Keys

The tranquil waters of Hemingway's playground are gentle enough to be navigated by moonlight. But those who don't want to miss out on the scenery can get the best of both worlds by taking to their paddles before the sun dips below the horizon.

Sunset tours start from Big Pine Key and meander through the Great White Heron National Wildlife Refuge.

Big Pine Kayak Adventure US$50 per person; www.keyskayaktours.com

Given the rate of climate change, there may only be a short window to explore this stretch of northern Botswana, with a meander into the magnificent 320,000-acre Selinda Reserve, by canoe.

Expect to see elephant, buffalo, wild dogs and a vast array of birds.
