"Full House" star Candace Cameron Bure has written a book that is sure to get women talking -- though perhaps not in the way she anticipated.

"Balancing It All: My Story of Juggling Priorities and Purpose," is all about her life as a working wife and mom. But she also includes some information about her marriage to professional hockey player Val Bure. The couple have been married for 17 years and have three children.

"I am not a passive person, but I chose to fall into a more submissive role in our relationship because I wanted to do everything in my power to make my marriage and family work," the actress writes in her book.

During a recent interview with The Huffington Post, Cameron Bure explained what she meant.

"The definition I'm using with the word 'submissive' is the biblical definition of that," she said. "So, it is meekness, it is not weakness. It is strength under control, it is bridled strength."

"And, listen, I love that my man is a leader," she said. "I want him to lead and be the head of our family. And those major decisions do fall on him. ... It doesn't mean I don't voice my opinion. It doesn't mean I don't have an opinion. I absolutely do, but it is very difficult to have two heads of authority."

"In my marriage we are equal ... in our importance, but we are just different in our performances within our marriage," she said.

The actress/author is still remembered for her role as playing D.J. Tanner on "Full House" and continues to work, most recently on the Hallmark Channel's movie "Let It Snow."

Her family is no stranger to controversy. Her brother, "Growing Pains" star Kirk Cameron was criticized in 2012 for comments he made about gay marriage to CNN's Piers Morgan. Cameron Bure sought to explain that she does not consider her role as a wife to be less than that of her husband's in their relationship.

As for a possible "Full House" reunion Cameron Bure told The Huffington Post that fans of the show "would love to see that happen, so who knows?"
