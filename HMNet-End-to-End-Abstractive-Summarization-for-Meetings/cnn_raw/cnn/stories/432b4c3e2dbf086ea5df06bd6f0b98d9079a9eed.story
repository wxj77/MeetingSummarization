(CNN) -- The ever-changing cast of "Saturday Night Live" is getting two new faces, but losing a couple of current members.

Michaela Watkins was known for her impressions of Barbara Walters and "Today" show co-host Hoda Kotb.

Michaela Watkins and Casey Wilson have been dropped from the show, while Jenny Slate and Nasim Pedrad are joining the cast, Entertainment Weekly reports.

Watkins -- who joined "SNL" mid-season last year and was known for her hilarious impersonations of Barbara Walters and Kathie Lee Gifford's suffering "Today" show co-host Hoda Kotb -- said she was shocked by the firing.

In an interview with EW, she recalled getting the news from Lorne Michaels, the creator and executive producer of "Saturday Night Live."

"I don't think anyone knows what Lorne Michaels was thinking," Watkins told the magazine.

"The only explanation I got from him -- and he's not known to say things just to make people feel better -- was that he felt deep down that I should have my own show. And I agreed. 'SNL' was a dream come true for me. It was a fantastic year. I don't have any regrets."

Watkins told EW she thinks the new hires will be "exquisite" on the show and said she would take Michaels' advice to pursue her own show.

Meanwhile, "SNL" veteran Darrell Hammond is still negotiating for a return to the show, Variety reports.

"Saturday Night Live" kicks off its 35th season on September 26.
