(EW.com) -- Talk about touchdown casting!

After closing out his guest spot on "Parenthood" in the fall, Michael B. Jordan is headed back to the small screen for a guest spot in "House's" 14th episode, playing a blind patient, the studio confirms to EW.

Jordan spilled the news earlier today via Twitter, but it appears he may have done so prematurely. The tweet has since disappeared from his feed, and later, he tweeted, "My bad @foxbroadcasting." and "Now I know never to tweet before the studio approves. hahha #socialnetworkisinsane."

Jordan previously starred on "Friday Night Lights" as quarterback Vince Howard. "House," currently in its 8th season, returns January 9, with a two hour episode.
