(CNN) -- British police arrested a 44-year-old man accused of trying to get into London's Buckingham Palace illegally on Monday, authorities said.

David Belmar was stopped at the main gate facing the Victoria Memorial, and a search revealed he was carrying a knife, according to Metropolitan Police.

He did not gain access to the palace grounds, police said.

The man was arrested on suspicion of trespassing on a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon, and remained in custody Monday afternoon, police said. He was later charged with trespassing and possession of a bladed or pointed article.

No injuries were reported.

Belmar is expected to appear in custody at West London Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.

Buckingham Palace, the best known of Queen Elizabeth II's palaces, is the administrative center for the royal household as well as the queen's London residence.

The incident came more than a month after police said a man scaled a security fence to enter the palace. The man was found inside the palace in an area open to the public during the day, police said. Two men were arrested on that day -- one on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary, the other accused of burglary, trespass and criminal damage.
