(CNN) -- One year after leading the New York Knicks to their first division title in nearly two decades, head coach Mike Woodson is out of a job.

The Knicks announced Monday they fired Woodson and his coaching staff, days after the team failed to clinch a playoff spot.

Woodson's departure is the first big move by team President Phil Jackson -- who won championships as a coach with the Bulls and Lakers -- since the latter arrived last month.

"I have a tremendous amount of respect for Mike Woodson and his entire staff," Jackson said in a statement. "The coaches and players on this team had an extremely difficult 2013-14 season, and blame should not be put on one individual. But the time has come for change throughout the franchise as we start the journey to assess and build this team for next season and beyond.

"Everyone in this franchise owes a great deal of gratitude to what Mike and his staff have done. We wish him the best."

The Knicks finished ninth in the NBA's Eastern Conference this year with a 37-45 record. Woodson was 109-79 as head coach for the Knicks.
