(CNN) -- Israeli warplanes took to the air overnight Thursday, striking back after rockets were fired into territory from Gaza, Israeli and Palestinian officials said.

Hamas security sources said that two Palestinian rockets were fired into Israel on Thursday night. The Israel Defense Forces said in a news release that one such rocket caused damage to an abandoned building.

In response, an Israeli military aircraft targeted what the IDF described as a "terror activity site" in the central Gaza Strip overnight.

"A direct hit was confirmed," the statement added.

Around 1 a.m. Friday, an Israeli missile hit a Hamas military base located east of the al-Maghazi refugee camp, said Hamas security sources. They added that Israeli warplanes remained in the skies at least 40 minutes later.

There were no related injuries, local medical sources said.

CNN's Kamal Ghattas contributed to the report.
