London (CNN) -- Police have released CCTV photographs of the man they believe tried to kill a former Russian banker gunned down outside his east London home last month.

German Gorbuntsov, 45, was shot several times as he walked from a taxi to an apartment block on Byng Street in the Isle of Dogs, near the Canary Wharf business district, at around 7.20pm GMT on March 20.

The man police believe tried to kill him was caught on surveillance cameras in nearby Manilla Street moments after the shooting. Detectives say a gun, a hooded top and a bag were later found dumped close by.

"We are continuing to examine CCTV footage from the area," said Detective Chief Inspector Russell Taylor of the Metropolitan Police, who is in charge of the investigation.

"We are keen to speak with anyone who may have information about the shooting. Were you in Byng Street or nearby, shortly before or after 7.20pm GMT on Tuesday March 20?

"Did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the area? Did you see the man in the CCTV stills taking off a dark hooded top or leaving a bag?"

Police say the suspect is white, about 6ft tall and slim. He was wearing a dark hooded top and jeans.

More than a month on from the shooting, Gorbuntsov remains in an unnamed London hospital in a stable condition; police say he is no longer in a coma.

The motive for the attack remains unclear; detectives say they are keeping "an open mind" as to why Gorbuntsov was targeted.

Last month, Russia's Kommersant newspaper cited Gorbuntsov's Russian lawyer, Vadim Vedenin, as saying the attack could be linked to an ongoing investigation into the attempted murder of another Russian banker, Aleksandr Antonov, in Moscow in 2009.
