(CNN)More drones were spotted flying over Paris overnight, the city prosecutor's office said Wednesday.

The unmanned aerial vehicles were spotted above Rue de Vaugirard, the Assembly, the city's east train station, Porte de Saint-Ouen and Porte de la Chapelle between 11 p.m. Tuesday and 2 a.m. Wednesday.

Authorities are investigating.

The sightings come a day after five drones were reportedly seen flying over other sensitive and well-known areas of Paris.

They were seen over the Eiffel Tower, the Bastille, Place de la Concorde, Les Invalides and the U.S. Embassy, said Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office. The drones were seen between midnight and 6 a.m.

Three journalists working for Al-Jazeera were arrested Wednesday afternoon after being spotted using drones in the Bois de Boulogne, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor said. There was no connection to the mystery drone flights over the past two days, the spokeswoman said.

All three were released Thursday, but the one who was identified as operating the drone will likely be prosecuted, the city Prosecutor's spokeswoman Agn√®s Thibault-Lecuivre told CNN.

Al-Jazeera said its crew was working on a story about the mystery.

"We will comment further when more information is available," a spokeswoman said.
