(CNN) -- No invitation? No problem!

That's what the former Miss New York told HLN on Tuesday in response to questions about her crashing the Miss USA float at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade last week.

Davina Reeves, whose reign as Miss New York ended on Sunday, said she wanted to be bold.

"I wanted to be fearless, and I wanted just that one last moment to say goodbye to New York," she said.

Video from the parade show Reeves, complete with crown and sash, atop the float with Miss USA Rima Fakih.

The former Miss New York was also seen walking along the parade route, waving, posing for pictures and flashing her beauty-queen smile.

Reeves said she meant no offense by the act and praised Fakih as an incredible woman and great friend.

"No regrets," she said. "That was one of the boldest things I've ever done in my life."
