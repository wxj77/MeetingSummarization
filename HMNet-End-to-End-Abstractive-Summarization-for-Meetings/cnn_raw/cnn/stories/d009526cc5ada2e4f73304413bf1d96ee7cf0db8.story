(CNN) -- A ruling is expected in coming weeks from a three-judge appeals court panel in Pennsylvania that heard Jerry Sandusky's bid for a new trial Tuesday on charges he sexually assaulted 10 boys, spanning two decades.

Sandusky was convicted of 45 counts, deemed a sexually violent predator, and is serving a 30- to 60-year state prison sentence.

Sandusky's appeal centers around three arguments: That he didn't have enough time to prepare for trial, that those who accused him waited too long to report the abuse to police, and that the prosecutor at trial improperly referenced a television interview Sandusky did with Bob Costas just days after he was charged.

The attorney general's office argued that there was overwhelming and consistent evidence against the former Penn State linebacker coach. Eight victims and two eyewitnesses testified about his pattern of abuse.

Almost all of the victims met Sandusky through his charity, The Second Mile, which he founded for troubled youth.

Tuesday's hearing was held in Luzerne County.
