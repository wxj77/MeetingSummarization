London (CNN) -- Five men picked up in a series of recent terror-related arrests have now been charged, London's Metropolitan Police said Friday.

Four of the men, who range in age from 20 to 24, were charged under the Terrorism Act and are accused of taking an oath of allegience to ISIS, according to a statement from police. The extremist group operating in Iraq and Syria has urged lone followers in the West to stage terror attacks in their home countries.

The fifth man arrested was charged with a firearms offense, according to police.

Three other men arrested in the same series of raids over the last 10 days have been released. A woman who was arrested was released on bail until next week, police said.

Authorities arrested the suspects after searching residences and vehicles in west and central London.

At the time of the arrests, authorities said they may have foiled an early-stage terror plot with the arrests.
