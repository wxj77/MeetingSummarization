(CNN)  -- Jorge Lorenzo continued his charge towards a maiden MotoGP world title with his seventh victory of the season in the Czech Grand Prix in Brno.

The 23-year-old Spaniard held off compatriot and pole sitter Dani Pedrosa with Australia's former world champion Casey Stoner completing the podium.

Reigning world champion and Lorenzo's Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi continued his remarkable comeback after a broken leg by claiming fifth.

Yamaha has dominated this season with Lorenzo drawing level with the record held by Michael Doohan and Giacomo Agostino of finishing first or second in the first 10 races of the season in motorcyling's elite category.

"It was a very difficult day as I had crashed in qualifying so my confidence was not so high. The wind made it difficult for the riders but for me its a fantastic win," he told the official MotoGP website.

Honda's Pedrosa was overtaken by Pedrosa on the first of the 22 laps and had to settle for second. He trails Lorenzo by 77 points in the title race.

2007 world champion Stoner was content to settle for third after a late change to the set-up of his Ducati on the morning of the race.

Ben Spies of the United States finished fourth, just ahead of Rossi with two more Americans, Nicky Hayden and Colin Edwards, in sixth and seventh.

A massive crowd of nearly 150,000 saw a Spanish hat-trick in the championship races.

Toni Elias won the Moto2 category with Nicolas Terol leading a Spanish clean sweep of the podium in the 125cc race.
