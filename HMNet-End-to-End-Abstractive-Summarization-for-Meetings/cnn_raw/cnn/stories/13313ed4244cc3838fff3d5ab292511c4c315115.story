(CNN) -- War widows, "motel kids" and the working poor are among the many people who have been helped by this year's top 10 CNN Heroes.

The top 10 -- remarkable everyday people changing the world -- were revealed Thursday by CNN's Anderson Cooper. All were nominated by CNN viewers inspired by their hard work and commitment.

Each of the top 10 will receive a $50,000 grant and be honored at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute," a globally broadcast event that airs December 11 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT.

One of the top 10 will be voted CNN Hero of the Year by the public and receive an additional $250,000.

The live tribute show, hosted by Cooper at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, will culminate in the announcement of the CNN Hero of the Year.

Through December 7, people can vote for their favorite Hero at CNNHeroes.com. They can also vote from mobile devices.
