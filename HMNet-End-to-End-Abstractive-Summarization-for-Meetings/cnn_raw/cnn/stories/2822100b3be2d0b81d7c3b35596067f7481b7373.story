The Eiffel Tower isn't the most popular place for pictures in Paris, nor is the Empire State Building the top photo destination in New York.

At least, that's the case among users of Google's geolocation-oriented photo-sharing website, Panoramio, according to Sightsmap.com, which has ranked 15,000 cities and their attractions according to photos tagged.

The result is a "heatmap" with bright areas indicating more photos.

New York tops the list as the most photographed -- or the highest Panoramio-penetrated -- city in the world.

Europe dominates the chart with eight places in the top 10.

Among them are three cities in Italy, including Rome, which ranked second.

Barcelona rounds out the top three cities, with Park Guell as its top attraction.

More photos are tagged of the Guggenheim Museum and the Tweed Courthouse than the Empire State Building in New York City, according to the poll. (Perhaps because the Empire State Building is a tougher picture to take?)

The Church of the Santissima Trinita dei Monti triumphs in Rome and the city's favorite wishing pond, Trevi Fountain, follows.

Moulin Rouge is the most Panoramio-photographed attraction in Paris -- the Eiffel Tower came fifth.

Istanbul, recently named the world's top destination by TripAdvisor, was the fifth hottest city on Sightsmap.com -- Kiz Kulesi (Maiden's Tower) is the city's top attraction.
