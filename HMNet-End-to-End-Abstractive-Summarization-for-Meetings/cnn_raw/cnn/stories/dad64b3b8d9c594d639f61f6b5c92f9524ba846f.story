(EW.com) -- Gleeks have to wait another eight days to see "Glee's" season 4 premiere, but Wednesday fans were treated to a taste of the music that the New Directions will be serenading us with this year. Wednesday evening, the "Glee" Facebook page featured a streaming presentation with five songs from the first two episodes of the season, all introduced by Darren Criss (Blaine) and Kevin McHale (Artie). No peeks at footage of the dance numbers for these songs, but the music was backed by stills from the new season.

EW tuned in to the stream, so if you missed it, we have the details on the music coming to the Fox musical show in the coming two weeks:

Mash-up of Lady Gaga's "Americano" and Jennifer Lopez's "Dance Again," sung by Kate Hudson

Rachel's nasty new dance teacher, played by Kate Hudson, must have been blessed with good vocal chords as well as nice legs. In the most danceable song of the five Glee songs previewed today, this mash-up features a sultry Hudson, who may have mastered a Spanish accent a little better than Lady Gaga did.

Imagine Dragon's "It's Time," sung by Darren Criss

Ladies (and gentlemen!), prepare yourselves for some more Blaine Anderson-induced swooning. Criss will sing this hit by the Las Vegas-based up-and-coming band Imagine Dragons. It starts off instrumentally minimal, with one plucky guitar and some claps and foot-stomping providing the percussion. Then the song fills out during the chorus as strings and piano come in for the winning cover.

Mash-up of Britney Spears' "Boys" and Justin Bieber's "Boyfriend," sung by Darren Criss and Kevin McHale

Time to channel your inner boy band, Artie and Blaine! For the Criss and McHale's first duet on the show, Glee is delivering yet another mash-up, this time bringing together the music of a longtime pop queen and today's pop prince for the show's second Britney Spears-themed episode. Criss revealed that they were directed to make the number "as cheesy and boy band as possible." He and McHale even gave fans tuned into the stream a "boy band pose," chins out, eyes squinted, pouty lips slightly parted. Let's hope there's plenty more where that came from when the mash-up airs next week.

Britney Spears' "Gimme More," sung by Heather Morris

There's not a lot new or innovative as far as Glee's cover of this song goes, but it sounds like the dance moves that accompany it will be unmissable. Chord Overstreet appeared in the live stream to help introduce "Gimme More," also set for the Britney Spears episode. He gave us this tease about the scene for this song: "We're all dancing in it and shaking our rumpeses." Singing this one is Glee's very own Brittany S. Pierce, Heather Morris.

Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe," sung by the Glee cast

Last but certainly not least, we got to hear the song of the summer â€” the ubiquitous "Call Me Maybe" â€” sung by an ensemble of Glee cast members. Count on it having as much energy as a car- or plane-ful of collegiate or Olympic athletes belting out the catchy pop song.

Glee's season 4 premiere airs Thursday, Sept. 13 at 9 p.m. Music from the new season will be available for download on iTunes beginning Tuesday, Sept. 11.
