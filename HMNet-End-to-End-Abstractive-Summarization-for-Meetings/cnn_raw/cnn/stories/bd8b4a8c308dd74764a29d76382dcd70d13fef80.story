(EW.com) -- The CW's "Gossip Girl" went out on a (relatively) high note.

The final episode of the CW's brand-establishing soap delivered 1.5 million viewers and a 0.8 rating among adults 18-49, the show's best performance this season. Along with a special "Gossip Girl" retrospective at 8 p.m., this was the network's best Monday performance in a year.

Over on NBC, a preview of the new White House comedy "1600 Penn" performed somewhat modestly given its big lead-in from "The Voice." The Josh Gad sitcom had 7.2 million viewers and a 2.3 rating in the demo, coming after The Voice's 13.3 million and a 4.1 rating. By comparison, the "1600" performance was down 8 percent from "The New Normal's" post-"Voice" preview earlier this fall.

Also Monday: CBS was the top network for the second Monday in a row, with "How I Met Your Mother" and "Mike & Molly" posting slight gains, while "2 Broke Girls" slipped due to "The Voice" expanding into the 9 p.m. hour this week.
