Bill and Giuliana Rancic have revealed their fertility struggles continue.

The pair told People magazine that their surrogate recently suffered a miscarriage. The couple have a toddler son, Duke, who was born via surrogate in 2012. Bill Rancic said this past season of their E! reality show, "Giuliana and Bill," has been about their attempt to have another baby.

"Unfortunately our surrogate, Delphine, who we love very much, had a miscarriage," he said. "It's something that we didn't see coming. We were devastated."

Giuliana Rancic, who is a host on E!,  tried in-vitro treatments to get pregnant and in 2011 announced that she had breast cancer. She underwent a double mastectomy.

Her husband said they will continue to try to grow their family with the help of the surrogate.

"We're fighters," he said. "Hopefully we're going to have good news and Delphine will be on board one more time. We've had to battle it out and that's something that we're going to continue to do."
