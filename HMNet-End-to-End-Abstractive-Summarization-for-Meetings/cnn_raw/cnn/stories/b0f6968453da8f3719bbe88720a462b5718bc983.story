(CNN) -- The president of one of the world's most famous football clubs is facing jail after being sentenced for tax evasion.

Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness was found guilty by a German court Thursday and sentenced to three years and six months.

Hoeness, 62, admitted to evading â‚¬28.4 million ($39.6 million) in taxes on income earned in secret Swiss bank accounts.

Hoeness was initially charged with evading â‚¬3.5 million ($4.87 million) but that increased to $39.6 million during the trial.

State prosecutor Achim von Engel had called for a prison sentence of five-and-a-half years for Hoeness on seven counts of tax evasion.

Former Germany international Hoeness, a member of the 1972 European Championship winners and 1974 World Cup winning side, enjoyed a stellar career with Bayern.

He won three Bundesliga titles and three European Cups while playing for the German giant.

Hoeness will appeal the verdict, his defense lawyer, Hanns Feigen, told reporters outside the court.

The notice of appeal must be handed to the Supreme Court in Karlsruhe (the court that will deal with the case) by March 20.
