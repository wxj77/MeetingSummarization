(EW.com ) -- Call it "Low Winter" one and done.

AMC canceled the drama series "Low Winter Sun" after a single season, marking a rare freshman season axing at the network. Based on a British miniseries, the Detroit-set crime drama starred Mark Strong as a homicide detective.

The show premiered in August to a relatively modest 2.5 million viewers despite a strong Breaking Bad lead-in, then fizzled during the course of its run. Low Winter Sun joins 2010â€²s Rubicon as the network's only hour-long original drama to get canceled after a single season. Though fellow dank crime show The Killing was rather spectacularly and repetitively revived post-cancellation, it seems very unlikely that low-buzz Winter will receive the same reconsideration.

Meanwhile, AMC has at least five dramas on tap for 2014: In addition to the return of "Mad Men," "The Walking Dead" and "Hell on Wheels," the network will introduce Revolutionary War drama "Turn," 1980s computer biz drama "Halt and Catch Fire" and possibly the Breaking Bad spin-off "Better Call Saul."
