"The Laverne & Shirley"/"This is Spinal Tap" vet will co-star as a gifted lawyer named Dr. Thurber who is hampered by a strange affliction on AMC's meth drama prequel, which follows the exploits of oily lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) before he hooks up with Walter White (Bryan Cranston).

The show, which is slated to hit the air in November, also features another "Bad" alum, Saul's stone-faced PI Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks).
