(CNN) -- It's not a great sign for the music industry when the year's top-selling album is the soundtrack to a Disney movie.

So far in 2014, there hasn't been a single album from a music artist that's sold a million copies or more, according to Billboard.

While "Frozen's" soundtrack has done just fine, with just over 3 million units sold as of October 10, it seems music fans haven't been as eager about albums released by artists.

In fact, the two performers who've come closest to reaching platinum-level success in 2014 actually released their albums last year. Beyonce's self-titled artistic smash has gone on to notch 776,000 units so far this year, while Lorde's "Pure Heroine" has pushed 754,000.

Even the "Frozen" soundtrack is a holdover, as it arrived last November.

As for 2014 releases, Eric Church is so far the biggest hit. The country star's "Outsiders," which arrived in February, has sold 722,000, closely followed by Coldplay's "Ghost Stories."

But perhaps not all hope is lost: 2014 still has some major players up ahead. Taylor Swift will release her latest album, "1989," on October 27, and the Foo Fighters' "Sonic Highways" is slated for November.

And if all else fails, maybe someone can convince Beyonce to drop another surprise album.
