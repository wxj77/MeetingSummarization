(CNN) -- Severe storms pounded south-central Michigan Sunday, knocking out power to more than 100,000 customers and cutting a path of destruction through the city of Battle Creek, officials said.

"The storms hit our business corridor and residential area the hardest," said Mike McKenzie, Battle Creek's emergency services director. "There are numerous trees on houses and cars, widespread power outages and a lot of businesses damaged."

The severe weather hit Battle Creek late Sunday afternoon, kicking up winds in excess of 80 mph, according to McKenzie, who said no major injuries had been reported.

In Calhoun County, where Battle Creek is located, some 29,000 customers of Consumers Power were without electricity late Sunday, company spokesman Jay Jacobs said. Throughout the states, 104,000 customers of the utility were without power.

Severe weather also raked the Chicago area, forcing the cancellation of 450 flights, according to a media official at O'Hare International Airport.
