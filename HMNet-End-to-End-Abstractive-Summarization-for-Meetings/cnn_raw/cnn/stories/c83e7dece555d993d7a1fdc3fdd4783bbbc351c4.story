(CNN) -- Charles Keating, best known for his role as villain Carl Hutchins on the NBC soap opera "Another World," has died, his son said Tuesday.

The 72-year-old actor had been fighting lung cancer for several years and died Friday, Sean Keating said.

The London native began his career on the stage, appearing with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Charles Keating turned his attention toward television, first in the United Kingdom, then in the United States.

He enjoyed stints as reformed criminal Hutchins on "Another World" -- from 1983 to 1985 and from 1991 to 1998 and the final episode in 1999. His work earned him a Daytime Emmy win for outstanding lead actor in a drama series in 1996.

Keating also appeared on soaps "As the World Turns," "All My Children" and "Port Charles" and prime time shows including "Sex and the City," "Xena: Warrior Princess" and "Miami Vice."

The actor appeared in numerous films, including 1992's "The Bodyguard," and the 1999 version of "The Thomas Crown Affair."

Keating was nominated for a Tony Award in 1986 for his featured role in the Broadway play "Loot."

His former "Another World" co-star Alicia Coppola tweeted about the veteran actor.

"Charles Keating has passed," Coppola wrote. "I am so very sad. Along w/ @LindaDano he was my very first acting teacher. The actress I am is because of them."

Keating died at his home in Weston, Connecticut. Keating is survived by his wife, Mary, and one other son.

"He as an extraordinary actor. He was an actor's actor," Sean Keating said.

Charles Keating told his family he wanted to be cremated and there will be no funeral, instead a traditional Irish celebration of his life will take place on his birthday, his son said.

The Internet Movie Database says Keating was born on October 22, 1941.
