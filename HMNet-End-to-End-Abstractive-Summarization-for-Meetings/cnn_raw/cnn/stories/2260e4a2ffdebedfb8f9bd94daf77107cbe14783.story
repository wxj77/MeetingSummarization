A descendent of Italian immigrants, Benedetti authored such best-selling novels as "The Truce" and "Juan Angel's Birthday," as well as a collection of short stories and poems.

The poet-turned-novelist became a part of a thriving era of Latin authors including Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Carlos Fuentes, and Mario Vargas Llosa, who often intertwined politics with their work.

A supporter of Fidel Castro's government, Benedetti left Uruguay to live in exile, partly in Cuba, where his writings grew more political.

"I have never hidden my political position so I had to leave the country," he told CNN in a June 2005 interview.

"I've had many mishaps, many problems in my short life," he added.

Journalist Dario Klein in Montevideo contributed this report.
