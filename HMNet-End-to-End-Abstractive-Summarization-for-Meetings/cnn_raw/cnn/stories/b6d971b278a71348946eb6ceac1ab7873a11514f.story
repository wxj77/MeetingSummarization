(CNN)Rosie O'Donnell is saying goodbye to "The View"  for a second time.

O'Donnell, 52, was co-hosting the ABC  daytime chat show after departing back in 2007. Next week will be her last after nearly five months on the job.

She's leaving the show to focus on her family after she split from her wife, Michelle Rounds, in November, her publicist said in a statement Friday.

"Rosie has teens and an infant at home that need her attention,"  the statement said.  "This has been a very stressful situation. She is putting her personal health and family first."

Before her marriage to Rounds three years ago, she was married to Kelli Carpenter.

ABC said it supports her decision.

"Rosie is an immensely talented star who comes in each and every morning brimming with ideas, excitement and passion for the show," ABC said in a statement.

" When she told us that she wanted to exit  "The View," we respected and understood her desire to put her well-being and her family first.  We're delighted she's still part of the ABC family with upcoming guest appearances on "The Fosters." And we know she'll return to "The View" often with her unique point of view and updates on her work and her family."

There was no word on who will replace her.

CNN's Tony Marco and Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.
