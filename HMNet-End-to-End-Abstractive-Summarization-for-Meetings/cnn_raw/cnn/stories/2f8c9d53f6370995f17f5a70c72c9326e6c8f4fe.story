(EW) -- You probably thought that, since the "Amazing Spider-Man" sequel started filming a couple weeks ago, we were probably done with Internet-imploding casting announcements.

Well, you were wrong ... dead wrong!

'Amazing Spider-Man 2' starts filming: Read the synopsis, see pictures from the set

EW has confirmed the news, originally reported by The Hollywood Reporter, that Chris Cooper has joined the cast of "Amazing Spider-Man 2." He'll play Norman Osborn, the father of Peter's best friend Harry who is destined to become Spider-verse uber-baddy the Green Goblin.

Cooper is stepping into a role that was previously played by Willem Dafoe, who unfortunately had to spend half of 2002â€²s "Spider-Man" in a green exoskeleton that made him look like Lord Zedd's lame step-brother.

Paul Giamatti in talks to play Rhino in 'Spider-Man' sequel

It's unclear exactly how big a role Cooper will play in the sequel. The movie's nominal villain is Jamie Foxx's Electro, plus maybe also Paul Giamatti's Rhino, and that's not to mention new arrivals like Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn and Shailene Woodley's Mary Jane Watson.

(Shockingly, there are no rumors about the possibility of casting Jennifer Lawrence as Felicia Hardy, unless even saying that there are no rumors counts as a rumor.)

Assuming they're planning to go Full Saga with the "Amazing" franchise, it seems likely that Cooper will appear as a minor character in the sequel, setting up a very Goblin-ful threequel.

The point is, there are now at least three Oscar winners in the cast of a "Spider-Man" movie, proving that we live in a golden age of ... well, something.
