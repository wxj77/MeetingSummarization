Los Angeles (CNN) -- The reboot of "The View" is now complete, with ABC announcing that actress Rosie Perez and political analyst Nicolle Wallace will be the new panelists.

They will join comedienne Rosie O'Donnell, whose addition was announced earlier, and Whoopi Goldberg, the only one remaining from the last season of the show.

When the show returns September 15, it will boast a complete retool -- a new logo and a new producer and, of course, new hires.

Perez, who first garnered attention with her role in Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," is a regular on screen and stage.

Wallace was a senior advisor to John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and communications director for President George W. Bush.

They both served as guest co-hosts last season.

O'Donnell co-hosted "The View" during its 10th season in 2006-07. Her on-air battles with then-co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck -- over issues like the Iraq war, which O'Donnell was vehemently against -- were loud and legendary. Producers are hoping for similar magic with her rejoining.

Changes at the talk show commenced in May, when one of its co-creators and original co-host, Barbara Walters, stepped down.

Along with Walters, two other co-hosts have stepped down -- Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy.
