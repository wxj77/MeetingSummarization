(CNN) -- Did Andi Dorfman choose wisely with her final rose?

At the very least she chose geographically, as the Atlanta-based former assistant district attorney selected former baseball player Josh Murray, who also lives in her city. No long-distance romance for this pair, but plenty of speculation about whether their engagement will actually result in a marriage.

Left holding his heart in his hand was Chicago-based businessman Nick Viall, who was dumped in a very nontraditional "Bachelorette" way. Instead of waiting for the final rose ceremony, Dorfman went to his room and broke the news to him.

"Honestly, the last date, I wanted to just have fun and relax, and hard as I tried I couldn't do that with you. ... With you I overanalyze everything," Dorfman told him. "A life with you would be overanalyzing every single moment."

That left Murray to receive the final rose after a few minutes of "suspense."

But the real drama came during the live "After the Rose" show, in which Viall questioned Dorfman's decision in light of some of the moments fans didn't see on camera.

"If you weren't in love with me," he said, "I'm just not sure why you made love to me."

Thus went another "Bachelor/Bachelorette" unspoken "tradition" in that much can be hinted at -- but contestants are never, ever to spill the sexual beans.

Viall kept it classy on social media, tweeting about Dorfman and Murray, "Congratulations to @AndiDorfman and @jmurbulldog on their engagement. Wishing you both incredible happiness. #TheBachelorette #Bachelorette."

Despite the sighs heard round the world by Viall fans, there is speculation that the next "Bachelor" will be fan favorite Iowa farmer Chris Soules, who won many in the audience over with his sweetness and good looks.

What do you think? Are Dorfman and Murray meant to be? Will they go the distance?
