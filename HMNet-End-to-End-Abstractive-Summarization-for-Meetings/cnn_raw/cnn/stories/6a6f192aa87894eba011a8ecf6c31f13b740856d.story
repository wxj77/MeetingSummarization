(CNN) -- Brazil cruised into the quarterfinals of the men's Olympic football tournament with a 100% record, despite having a man sent off in Wednesday's 3-0 win against New Zealand.

The South Americans, five-time world champions but seeking a first gold medal at the Games, topped Group C with three victories ahead of second-placed Egypt.
