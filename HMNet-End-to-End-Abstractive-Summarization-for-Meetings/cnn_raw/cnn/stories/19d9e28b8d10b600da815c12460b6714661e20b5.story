(CNN) -- A plane carrying former President George W. Bush was diverted to Louisville on Saturday night after the pilot reported the smell of smoke.

The Gulfstream IV aircraft was traveling from Philadelphia International to Dallas Love Field airports when the pilot reported the smell of smoke in the cockpit, said Holly Baker, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration.

She said the plane landed safely in Louisville, Kentucky.

By early Sunday morning, Bush arrived safely home in Dallas, his spokesman Freddy Ford said.
