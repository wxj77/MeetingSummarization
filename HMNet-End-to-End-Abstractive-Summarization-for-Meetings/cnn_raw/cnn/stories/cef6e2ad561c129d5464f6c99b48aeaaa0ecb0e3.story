(CNN)A 59-year-old man was arrested early Saturday in connection with the grisly discovery of body parts in a suitcase left on a San Francisco sidewalk.

Mark Andrus was booked for murder, San Francisco Police Department spokeswoman Grace Gatpandan said.

Police were alerted to his location on Friday night by someone who called a tip line.

Gatpandan said the investigation is ongoing and encouraged people to continue to call the tip line.

On Friday police released three photos of a man they called a person of interest.

The dismembered body was discovered Wednesday when police where called to the South of Market district in San Francisco. Other body parts were found in a trash can less than a block from the main crime scene.

Police have not disclosed what body parts were in the suitcase and trash can.
