(CNN) -- It paid to be a "Lost" fan Tuesday night. That is, it paid $150.

Four of the six numbers drawn in the estimated $380 million Mega Millions lottery matched the numbers immortalized by the Lost character Hugo "Hurley" Reyes, who hit a $114 million jackpot off them -- only to be haunted by the same numbers in later episodes.

Tuesday's Mega Millions numbers were 4, 8, 15, 25, 47 and 42 (42 was the Mega Ball number).

Hurley's numbers were 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42.

Unnerved watchers of the hit television show must have been left wondering whether the Dharma Initiative had a hand in the drawing.

If you played Hurley's numbers, you won $150, according to a payout table on the Mega Millions website, though the same table noted that fixed prizes such as the $150 one "may be paid on a pari-mutuel basis and (be) lower than" that amount.

But at least two people fared better than Hurley after Tuesday night's drawing. Two tickets matched all six numbers, according to a news release from Mega Millions. Owners of those tickets, which were sold in Idaho and Washington, will split the jackpot.

David Workman, a spokesman for the Idaho Lottery, said he did not know where in his state the ticket was sold. Idaho began selling tickets on January 31, 2010.

"Idaho is a very lucky place," he added.

CNN's Scott Thompson contributed to this report.
