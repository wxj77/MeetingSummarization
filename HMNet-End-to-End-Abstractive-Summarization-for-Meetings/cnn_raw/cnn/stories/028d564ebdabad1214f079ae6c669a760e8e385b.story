(CNN) -- The man who police say plowed his vehicle into a California Walmart, where he then attacked several customers, was booked Monday on four counts of assault with a deadly weapon and resisting arrest.

Haamid Zaid, 33, of Seaside, California, is suspected of having been under the influence of drugs, but the motive is under investigation, according to Albert Morales, an officer with the San Jose Police Department.

"Once Mr. Zaid emerged from the vehicle, he used some type of metal object to attack people," Morales said of the Sunday incident at the San Jose store.

The suspect was later subdued by a group of customers until police arrived, he said

One of the victims, a 61-year-old man, was transported to an area hospital. The injury was considered serious but not life-threatening.

Three other unidentified victims were treated for injuries at the scene and released, authorities said.

Detectives are reviewing surveillance video to help determine how the vehicle plowed into the store and whether the crash was intentional.
