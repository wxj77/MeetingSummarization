(CNN) -- Jenson Button is relishing Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix, as the McLaren driver returns to the site of his first-ever victory for the 200th race of his Formula One career.

The 31-year-old withdrew from last weekend's German Grand Prix, won by his teammate Lewis Hamilton, after 35 laps with hydraulics problems, but Button is hoping for better luck at the track where he tasted success as a Honda driver in 2006.

"It's always fun coming back to Hungary as this is the track at which I won my first grand prix," the 2009 drivers' champion told McLaren's web site. "After a premature end to my race at the Nurburgring, I'll be hoping for better luck at the Hungaroring.

"I can't believe I've already knocked up a double-ton of F1 starts because I don't feel a day older than when I made my debut back in 2000!"

Resurgent Hamilton triumphs in Germany

Button made his first appearance in the elite division of motorsport at the Australian Grand Prix in 2000 with Williams, and has since gone on to represent Benetton, Renault, BAR, Honda, Brawn GP and now McLaren in an 11-year career.

The Briton has notched up 10 grand prix triumphs and secured his only world crown to date in 2009, while racing for Brawn.

Button is hopeful of a strong showing on Sunday and is taking encouragement from his third-place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix -- a circuit he feels presents a very similar challenge to the Hungaroring.

"The MP4-26 [McLaren's car] was very competitive in Monaco a couple of months ago and I hope it will be a similar situation this weekend because the Hungaroring has many of the same performance criteria.

"Cockpit temperatures regularly exceed 50 degrees and we're always pulling g-force in the car because there are so many corners. It's tough, but this is definitely a circuit when all the training pays dividends."

Hamilton is also a previous winner in Hungary having triumphed at the venue in 2007 and the 26-year-old is eager to build on his success at the Nurburgring last time out.

"I've always gone well in Hungary," said the 2008 world champion. "I like the circuit because it's old school. It has a very historic feel to it, with hills and bumps and cambers changes, and it has massive character."

Hamilton beat off fierce competition from Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber of Red Bull to earn a hard-fought win in Germany and he is anticipating another close contest.

"There wasn't much between McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull in Germany. It's going to be fascinating to see which team holds the advantage next weekend."

Despite Hamilton, Alonso and Webber finishing on the podium last time out, all three drivers trail reigning world champion and current standings leader Sebastian Vettel.

Vettel, 24, holds a 77-point lead over his colleague Webber at the top of the championship heading into the 11th race of the season.
