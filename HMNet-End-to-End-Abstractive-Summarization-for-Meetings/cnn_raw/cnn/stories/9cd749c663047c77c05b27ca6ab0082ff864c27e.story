(CNN) -- French club Lyon kept up their hoodoo over Real Madrid with a 1-0 win on Tuesday night as the Spanish giants face the prospect of exiting Europe's premier competition at the last-16 stage for the sixth successive season.

Lyon will take a narrow lead into the second leg of the Champions League tie thanks to a stunning second-half strike from Jean Makoun.

Real, who have lost their last three trips to the Stade Gerland without scoring a goal, will battle to overturn the deficit next month at their Santiago Bernabeu Stadium -- which will host the final in May.

Madrid president Florentino Perez spent a fortune on players such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka in pre-season with the stated goal of winning the Champions League, as the club did in his first reign, and ending the dominance of rivals Barcelona.

But coach Manuel Pellegrini has seen his side languish in second place to Barca in La Liga and suffer an embarrassing exit from the Copa Del Rey, so will be hoping his expensive legion of stars can bounce back from this defeat.

After both sides went close with several half-chances, Lyon almost took the lead five minutes before halftime when winger Cesar Delgado lashed a volley against the left-hand post as Miralem Pjanic's corner was only half-cleared.

Two minutes after the break, Cameroon midfielder Makoun was allowed to surge to within 25 meters of the Real goal and he fired a right-foot effort that sailed past keeper Iker Casillas and into the top corner of the net.

Ronaldo went close for Real with a deflected effort from similar distance, but the visitors were almost caught on the counter-attack as Casillas did well to deny Aly Cissokho.

Gonzalo Higuain tested Lyon goalkeeper Hugo Lloris before being replaced by former Lyon star Karim Benzema with 15 minutes left, but Real were unable to force an equalizer.
