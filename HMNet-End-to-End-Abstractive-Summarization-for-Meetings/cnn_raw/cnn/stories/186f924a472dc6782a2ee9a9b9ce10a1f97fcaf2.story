(CNN) -- The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a $16 billion bill to overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs.

It is a bipartisan response to the scandal over delayed care at medical facilities and allegations of alarming management shortcomings at the sprawling federal agency that serves millions of veterans.

The Senate is expected to vote on the plan as early as Thursday.

The legislation would provide money for new medical facilities, more doctors and nurses, and a new program that will allow some veterans to seek health care outside the VA system.

On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Robert McDonald as the new VA secretary. He replaces Eric Shinseki who resigned in May over the scandal, key details of which were revealed by a CNN investigation.

McDonald has promised to carry out reforms swiftly.
