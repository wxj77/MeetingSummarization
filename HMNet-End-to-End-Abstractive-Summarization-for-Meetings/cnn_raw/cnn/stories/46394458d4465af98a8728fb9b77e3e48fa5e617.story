(CNN)The economic Mood Map is a regular part of CNN's Davos coverage and gives you the chance to share sentiment about the economic climate in your county. You can then compare your results with CNN.com users all over the world.

The four questions you answer have multiple choice answers, representing sentiments from positive to negative. Once submitted, we compile the answers and color the world map, based on an average of the responses for each country.

So if 50% of respondents were very positive and 50% very negative, the country in question would be colored from the center of the scale. We also show how many people have responded in each country.

This is not a scientific poll. The results only indicate the sentiments felt by CNN.com users and may not reflect public opinion.

The data mostly come from the OECD, the United Nations and National Statistics Offices.
