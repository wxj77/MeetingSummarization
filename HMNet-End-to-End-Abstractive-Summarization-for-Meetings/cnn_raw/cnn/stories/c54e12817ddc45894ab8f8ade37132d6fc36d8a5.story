(CNN)  -- A Virginia Military Institute cadet has been charged with rape and sodomy after a female cadet reported she was the victim of sexual assault.

Stephen J. Lloyd, 21, is being held in the Rockbridge Regional Jail in Lexington, Virginia, according to a spokesman for the Rockbridge County Sheriff's Office.

The alleged assault took place over the weekend, VMI superintendent retired Gen. J.H. Binford Peay said in a statement, and Lloyd was arrested by VMI police on Tuesday.

"After the female cadet made her report, the systems and procedures that are in place to address the safety of all cadets and to provide support were immediately placed into operation," Peay said in the statement.

The case has been referred to the Virginia Commonwealth's Attorney and the state's criminal justice system, Peay said.

Of VMI's 1,428 cadets, 111 are women, school spokesman Lt. Col. Stewart MacInnis told CNN affiliate WSLS-TV.
