(Rolling Stone) -- Against Me! singer Laura Jane Grace says that coming out as transgender in a recent issue of Rolling Stone "completely ended my relationship with my father."

In a new interview with MTV News, Grace is asked about her father's response to the article and says, "He tried calling, I tried calling him back, but then he wouldn't call me back. I wrote him a really long email, and I apologized and told him the way he was portrayed in the Rolling Stone article was a little harsh. I apologized for that, I apologized for not telling him in person before â€” that I felt like a total coward for that. I explained about gender dysphoria; I told him if he had any questions, there were books I could point him in the direction of reading. He wrote me back maybe a two or three sentence-long email that just said, 'There was something very lacking in your presentation. For now the door is open, but we'll see.' And that's it."

Grace also speaks openly about her progress in transitioning from male to female and undergoing hormone replacement therapy.

"I'm one day from being one month into HRT. The mental effects have been immediately like night and day; it made a world of difference in my life. I find that in a lot of situations in the past where I would have gotten frustrated or angry, I am a lot more calm and centered. I just feel at ease and like myself. Physically, I feel impatient."

MTV also interviewed Grace's Against Me! bandmates, who discuss how her coming out has changed the day-to-day dynamic of the band.

"I think [the band] has been happier and everyone is getting along famously," says bassist Andrew Seward. "It's a very nice, positive, family vibe on the bus and at the shows."
