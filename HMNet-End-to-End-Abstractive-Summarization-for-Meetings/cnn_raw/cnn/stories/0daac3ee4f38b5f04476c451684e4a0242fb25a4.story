(CNN) -- While "Scandal" fans were recovering from April's Season 3 finale, star Kerry Washington quietly welcomed a baby.

According to TMZ, the 37-year-old actress welcomed a girl with husband Nnamdi Asomugha on April 21. The pair, who just as secretly wed last summer, named their new arrival Isabelle Amarachi.

While Washington hasn't sent out a public birth announcement, the word has spread through her "Scandal" family. At the White House Correspondents Dinner on May 3, Washington's TV dad Joe Morton said he was happy and excited for his co-star.

"I haven't spoken to her; I just found out about last night," Morton said.

A number of Washington's "Scandal" castmates were in attendance at Saturday's event, and while the new mom did spy some photos -- "The @ScandalABC family is looking AMAZING," she tweeted -- she was absent from the festivities.

Obviously, she has plenty to keep her occupied. A source told People magazine, "Kerry is at home busy with the baby."

CNN's Nischelle Turner contributed to this report.
