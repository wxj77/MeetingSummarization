(CNN) -- Massimo Ambrosini has signed a one-year contract extension at AC Milan to stay with the Italian club until 2011.

Ambrosini will remain with AC Milan until 2011 after signing a new one-year contract with the club.

The 32-year-old AC Milan captain scored seven goals in 27 Serie A appearances for the Rossoneri last season.

Ambrosini joined AC Milan in 1995 from second division side Cesena and is in his 14th campaign with the Italian giants.

"AC Milan can confirm that Massimo Ambrosini's contract has been extended and the player will remain at the club until 30th June 2011," read a statement on the club's official Web site.

Ambrosini was handed the Milan armband by coach Leonardo following Paolo Maldini's retirement this summer.
