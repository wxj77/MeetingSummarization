Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Thousands of Christian Copts in Cairo protested outside the offices of the Egyptian state broadcaster, witnesses said on Friday.

It was the seventh day of protests over what they're calling the "marginalization and lack of representation" of their concerns in state media.

There have been longstanding tensions between Muslims and Copts in Egypt, and 13 Copts were killed in sectarian clashes last Tuesday.

That erupted after a family dispute between Christians and Muslims resulted in a church burning south of Cairo.
