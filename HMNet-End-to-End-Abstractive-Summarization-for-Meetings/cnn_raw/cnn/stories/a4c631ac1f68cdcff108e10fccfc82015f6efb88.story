(CNN) -- Four minor boys are facing felony assault charges after a 13-year-old boy accused them of sexually assaulting him in the locker room of a Tampa, Florida, middle school, authorities said Friday.

The alleged victim told school officials he was assaulted with a broomstick and hockey stick at Walker Middle School, in southern Tampa, on April 30, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said.

Linda Cobbe with Hillsborough County Schools said police were contacted Wednesday afternoon after the boy reported the incident.

The four teenagers, 14 and 15 years old, were arrested at school Wednesday and charged with sexual assault and false imprisonment, the sheriff's office said. The victim said two boys held him down on the ground while the other two sexually assaulted him, the sheriff's office said.

The alleged victim had been "continually picked on and harassed by the suspects" before the incident, the sheriff's office said in a news release.

All four suspects have been suspended from school, Cobbe said.

On Thursday, the school's principal, Kathleen Hoffman, contacted students' parents through a recorded message, telling them the four would not be allowed to return to school "unless their legal issues are resolved."

Cobbe said the 13-year-old is back in classes at the school.
