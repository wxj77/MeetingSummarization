(EW.com) -- "VH1 Storytellers" is hitting up Grammy-winning ladies for its coming season: Pink, Alicia Keys, and Taylor Swift are the next batch of artists to be featured on VH1′s long-running music-interview franchise, EW has learned exclusively.

"I have always loved 'Storytellers' and, as a songwriter, how much fun it is to be able to tell your stories," Pink told EW exclusively about being included in the line-up. Of her stories, Pink adds with a wink: "Everyone has heard mine before!"

The newest season of Storytellers launches Nov. 11, with VH1 "Storytellers: Taylor Swift" airing at 11 p.m. The episode roll-out is fast and furious after that, with "VH1 Storytellers: Alicia Keys" and "VH1 Storytellers: Pink" airing at 11 p.m on over the next two days, on Nov. 12 and Nov. 13, respectively.

She'll tape her episode at a winning high school or college in the continental U.S. Through Sept. 23, students can vote for their school at a special website, which also includes more details about the contest.
