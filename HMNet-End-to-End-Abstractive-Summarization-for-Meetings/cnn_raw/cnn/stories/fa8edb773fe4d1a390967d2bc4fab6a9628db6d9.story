(CNN)If Azealia Banks is asked to leave the United States, that will probably be OK with her.

"I hate everything about this country," the rapper told Playboy interviewer Rob Tannenbaum. "Like, I hate fat white Americans. All the people who are crunched into the middle of America, the real fat and meat of America, are these racist conservative white people who live on their farms. Those little teenage girls who work at Kmart and have a racist grandma -- that's really America."

Those comments were preceded by remarks about race and racism, topics she frequently addresses on her no-holds-barred Twitter feed.

"It's always about race. Lorde can run her mouth and talk sh*t about all these other b***hes, but y'all aren't saying she's angry. If I have something to say, I get pushed into the corner," she said. "Really, the generational effects of Jim Crow and poverty linger on. As long as I have my money, I'm getting the f**k out of here and I'm gonna leave y'all to your own devices."

Her comments weren't limited to issues. Banks also lashed out at fellow artists Pharrell, Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West.

"In American society, the game is to be a nonthreatening black person," she said. "That's why you have Pharrell or Kendrick Lamar saying, 'How can we expect people to respect us if we don't respect ourselves?' He's playing that nonthreatening black man sh*t, and that gets all the white soccer moms going, 'We love him.'

"Even Kanye West plays a little bit of that game," she added.

She did approve of Jay Z, noting that "hasn't played any of those games."

The interview appears in Playboy's April issue.
