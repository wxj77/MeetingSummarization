(CNN) -- At least 27 people were killed Sunday night when a cargo train slammed into two cars south of Cairo, the state-run Egynews media outlet reported, citing Giza Gov. Ali Abdulrahman.

More than 25 other people were injured, Egypt's head of emergency services told Egynews.

It was not immediately clear what led up to the crash.

Deadly train crashes are not uncommon in Egypt.

In January, train cars filled with Egyptian security force recruits hopped the tracks and crashed in Giza, killing at least 19 people and injuring about 107 others.

In November 2012, 51 died and 17 were injured when a train slammed into a bus in Assiut, a city about 320 kilometers (about 200 miles) south of Cairo.

And in October 2009, at least 15 were killed when two trains collided in Al-Ayyat, about 70 kilometers (about 43 miles) south of the capital.
