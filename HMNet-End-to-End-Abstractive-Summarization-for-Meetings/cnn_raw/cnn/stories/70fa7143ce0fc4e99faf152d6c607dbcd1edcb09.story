(CNN) -- Add this tidbit to the "Suicide Squad" speculation.

According to Collider, actress Margot Robbie is on board to play Harley Quinn in the upcoming film. The character of Quinn first appeared in "Batman: The Animated Series," and is a love interest/henchwoman for the Joker.

Fans were already excited with the news that Warner Bros. may be in talks with Oscar winner Jared Leto for the role of the Joker. (Warner Bros. is owned by CNN's parent company.)

Australian actress Robbie has been making waves in Hollywood ever since her acclaimed role as Naomi Lapaglia, the girlfriend of Leonardo DiCaprio's Jordan Belfort, in Martin Scorsese's "The Wolf of Wall Street." She is currently filming the role of Jane Porter in "Tarzan," which stars Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd in the title role.

Robbie and Leto are just the latest to be connected to the "Suicide Squad" production. Other names bandied about for possible roles have included Tom Hardy and Will Smith.

"Suicide Squad," which will be a joint-production between Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment, is expected to arrive in theaters August 5, 2016.
