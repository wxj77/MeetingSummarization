(CNN) -- Scarlett Johansson's beau put a ring on it. But the wedding date is not yet set.

The actress is engaged to Romain Dauriac, who co-owns an independent advertising agency.

Her rep confirmed the happy news, but did not disclose when it occurred.

"They haven't chosen a date for the wedding," she said.

Johansson's marriage to Ryan Reynolds ended in 2011.

Last year, the actress told Vogue magazine that their divorce was "comically amicable."

But that did not mean it was a happy ending.

"Of course it's horrible," she told the magazine. "It was devastating. It really throws you. You think that your life is going to be one way, and then, for various reasons or whatever, it doesn't work out."

Johansson has appeared in various movies, including "Lost in Translation" and "Girl With a Pearl Earring."
