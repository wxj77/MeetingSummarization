(Reader's Digest)  -- "Would you marry the same person again?" could be a dangerous question.

However, an international poll conducted in 15 countries reveals that 68 percent of respondents, and even more women, would again say "I do" to their spouse.

The survey, which was conducted by Reader's Digest and published in the March issue, reveals that China has the highest level of spousal satisfaction (83 percent.)

Also at the top of the list: The Philippines, Germany and the Netherlands. The United States came in at number 12 for satisfaction levels (63 percent) and Malaysia last (59 percent.)

On average, men were more dissatisfied with their wives than women with their husbands. Malaysia tops the list with 48 percent of men stating they would untie the knot if given the chance. In Italy, however, 42 percent of the women would say "arrivederci" to their husbands.

Peggy Northrop, VP/Global Editor-in-Chief, Reader's Digest, said: "In the countries where marrying young is part of the culture, people seem to have a long time to wonder 'What if?' The survey results reminded me of the saying 'Marry in haste, regret at leisure.' Age and wisdom still influence marital satisfaction."

In the United States, Brazil, and Great Britain, respondents over age 45 are more likely than younger people to feel satisfied with their choices. But in Canada, France, India, Malaysia, and Spain, it is the 45-and-unders who feel more happily matched.

In the Philippines, where couples marry younger than in most nations, only 20 percent of those over age 45 say they would stay with the same spouse.

The countries that participated in the survey were Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, Philippines, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.
