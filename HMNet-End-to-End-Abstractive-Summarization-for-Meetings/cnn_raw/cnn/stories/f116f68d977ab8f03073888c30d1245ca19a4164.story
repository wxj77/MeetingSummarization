Los Angeles (CNN) -- A full autopsy report on the death of conservative blogger and activist Andrew Breitbart was released Wednesday, concluding that he died of heart failure as a result of coronary artery disease and an enlarged heart, coroner officials announced.

No significant trauma was detected, and foul play is not suspected, the Los Angeles County coroner's report said.

Breitbart, 43, died on March 1 after collapsing on a sidewalk in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood. He was transported to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and pronounced dead about 40 minutes later when emergency physicians were unable to revive him.

According to the autopsy report, Breitbart had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2011 after being rushed by ambulance to the same hospital because he had shortness of breath.

Opinion: How Breitbart changed the news

He was released from the hospital after a few days in 2011, and he began exercising and dieting, the report said.

The 6-foot-3, 251-pound Breitbart was considered "a light drinker," and he had 0.04 gram percent of alcohol in his blood and heart at the time of his death, the autopsy report said.

He also had 60% narrowing of the coronary artery, the report said.

A few weeks before his death, Breitbart had been recovering from flu symptoms and complained about "being under a lot of stress" but no further problems were noted, according to the autopsy findings.

No prescription or illicit drugs were found in his system, the report said.
