(CNN) -- We're just four months away from the London Olympics and the city is nearly ready to greet thousands of athletes and millions of visitors.

As part of CNN's coverage of London 2012, World Sport presenter Don Riddell will be presenting a live webcast on CNN.com and CNN iPhone and iPad apps on Wednesday at 5.30pm GMT, 6.30pm CET, 1.30pm ET.

Living and working in London, Don has reported on the Games since the British capital won the vote to stage the sporting showpiece in 2005.

What do you want to ask him? Is London ready? Will the city cope? Are there any spare tickets? Can anyone beat Usain Bolt in the 100 meters? Will the Thorpedo make a triumphant return to the pool?
