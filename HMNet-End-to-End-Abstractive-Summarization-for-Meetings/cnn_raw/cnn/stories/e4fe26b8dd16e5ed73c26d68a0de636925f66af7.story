(CNN Student News) -- March 20, 2014

Thirteen days after a Malaysia Airlines plane vanished, CNN Student News takes you to the Indian Ocean to show you how a military aircraft is helping in the search. In the UK, there's a new coin on the way, and we'll explain why it's being minted. You'll also hear about "math anxiety," and you'll meet a CNN Hero who captures the spirit of Women's History Month.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.
