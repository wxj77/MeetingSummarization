(CNN Student News) -- September 16, 2013

As the U.S. and Russia announce a deal regarding Syria's chemical weapons, CNN Student News examines the details of the agreement and shares some critics' reaction. We also report on severe flooding in Colorado and a fire along a boardwalk in New Jersey. Plus, we track a voyage from NASA's launch pad to the edge of the solar system, and we mark the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month.
