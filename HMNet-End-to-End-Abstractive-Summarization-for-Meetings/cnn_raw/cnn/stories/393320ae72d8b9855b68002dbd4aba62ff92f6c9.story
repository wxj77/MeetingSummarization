Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- A Facebook page has been shut down following claims Northern Ireland police officers were being set up for assassination on the social networking site.

"Crown Forces Watch" had called for people to post pictures of police officers and details of security operations across Northern Ireland.

The body representing officers, the Police Federation of Northern Ireland, had said publishing pictures was an attempt to "target police officers for murder."

The Facebook page closed Thursday with the administrator saying "this group was to report harassment only, not to endanger life as has been reported."

The page appeared after a series of recent police raids and arrests in connection with the murder in April of Catholic police officer Ronan Kerr. All the suspects were released without charge. The Facebook page claimed the men had been the victims of police harassment and intimidation and called for a response from the pro-Irish community.

A description on the site read: "Over the past few days in East Tyrone and South Derry the Crown Forces the PSNI/RUC (Police Service of Northern Ireland/Royal Ulster Constabulary) have launched a massive harassment and intimidation campaign aimed at Irish republicans. We must work together to combat this campaign of intimidation and harassment by working together as a fraternity opposed to this British oppression. The aim of this group is to keep people updated on the attacks, intimidation and ongoing harassment by the Crown Forces."

The Police Service of Northern Ireland said Thursday it had launched an investigating into the Facebook page.

Chairman of the Police Federation, Terry Spence, called for those involved to be prosecuted. "It is very clearly a very serious criminal offence to gather information which is likely to be of use to terrorists," he added.
