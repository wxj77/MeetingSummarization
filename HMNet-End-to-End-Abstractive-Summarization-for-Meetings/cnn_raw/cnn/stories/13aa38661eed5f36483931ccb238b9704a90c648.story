(CNN) -- The New York Yankees' World Series hopes may have just taken a hit, as shortstop Derek Jeter fractured his left ankle in game one of the American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers on Saturday night.

Jeter suffered the injury while fielding a ground ball in the top of the 12th inning, with New York trailing 5-4. He immediately went down in pain, staying face down momentarily.

Jeter was helped off the field, putting no weight on the ankle, with fans chanting "Derek Jeter!"

Yankees manager Joe Girardi confirmed the severity of Jeter's injury after the game.

"It won't jeopardize his career, but he will not be playing anymore for us this year," he said, adding it will likely take three months to recover from the injury.

Girardi said Eduardo Nunez will be activated to replace Jeter's spot on the roster. He added that third baseman Alex Rodriguez -- a former shortstop -- would not replace the Yankees captain at the position, citing that it's been too long since he has played there.

Detroit won the game 6-4. Game two is Sunday afternoon in New York.
