It's the thought that counts, right?

Tell that to the residents of 32 homes in the Dutch town of Ijsselstein, who were evacuated after a planned marriage proposal fell through.

A Dutchman rented a crane intending to reach his girlfriend's window Saturday morning and pop the question, Dutch affiliate RTL News said.

Instead, the crane tipped over, crashing through the roof of a neighboring home. Hours later, during an attempt to right the crane, it fell through the roof again, making the hole bigger.

As a result, residents of 32 homes were evacuated as a recovery company made another attempt to stabilize the crane.

The good news? No one was injured, and she said yes. The couple went directly to Paris to celebrate.
