(CNN) -- In this season of holiday parties and gift-giving, CNN Heroes offers ways to give from your heart -- without having to reach into your wallet -- and help a Hero help others. Happy giving.

1. Throw a party for water projects with Wine to Water  Having a holiday soiree? Let it benefit Wine to Water and spread holiday cheer worldwide.

Now his organization, impacting more than 50,000 people in nine countries, provides hosting tools to turn your party into a benefit for clean-water projects in remote regions around the globe. The group also offers its own wines to party hosts at discounted prices.
