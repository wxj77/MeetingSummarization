(CNN) -- A small plane landed on a New Jersey highway on Monday, fire officials said.

The two-seater craft was heading toward an airport in Teterboro, New Jersey, but instead touched down on Interstate 80 in Hackensack, New Jersey, after the pilot reported a loss of fuel pressure, said the city's fire chief, Thomas Freeman.

There were no reports of injuries.

Authorities closed one highway lane as emergency vehicles towed the plane alongside the beginnings of rush-hour traffic.
