New York (CNN) -- Two men have been arrested in the death of a popular television and radio disc jockey who was shot to death on Staten Island early Sunday morning, according to New York City police.

Corey McGriff, known to fans as DJ "Megatron," died of a gunshot wound to the torso near his home shortly after 2 a.m. March 27.

William Williams, 21, and Richard Cromwell, 20, both of Staten Island, were arrested Wednesday and charged with murder, robbery, and criminal possession of a weapon.

Williams and Cromwell are expected to be arraigned Thursday according to Peter Spencer, spokesman for the Staten Island District Attorney.

McGriff, 32, was best known for his appearances on the BET's music countdown show, "106 & Park." He had worked for both the show and BET.com since 2006, according to a statement released by the network.

"The BET Networks Family is saddened by the news of the untimely loss of our friend and colleague, Corey 'Megatron' McGriff," the statement said. "We extend our deepest condolence to his family. He will truly be missed."
