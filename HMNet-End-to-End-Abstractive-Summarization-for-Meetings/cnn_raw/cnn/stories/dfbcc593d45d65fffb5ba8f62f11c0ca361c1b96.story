(CNN) -- Good Willy Hunting?

Much is being made about chatter that actor Ben Affleck has a full frontal scene in his new film "Gone Girl." The actor was recently asked during an interview with MTV whether this would be the first time audiences would see ... little Ben and he jokingly responded, "I try to get it in every movie."

"It's ironic, because David (Fincher, the director) said to me from the beginning, 'This is a warts and all movie. It can have no vanity,'" Affleck said. "You have to see the naked underbelly of this character."

The highly anticipated film is based on the best-selling novel by Gillian Flynn about a man whose wife goes missing. Affleck plays bar owner Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike stars as his wife, Amy Elliott-Dunne.

Variety predicts the the movie will do well opening weekend against its main competitor, horror movie "Annabelle."

Ben Affleck says tabloid scrutiny helped 'Gone Girl' performance

"Look for 'Gone Girl' to maintain a slight edge over the competition with a debut of $25 million from roughly 3,013 locations, while 'Annabelle' should bow to $23 million from 3,155 venues," writes Brent Lang for Variety. "The studios behind the two films are being more conservative and predicting premieres in the $20 million range, while analysts are more bullish on 'Gone Girl's' prospects, projecting a debut of $30 million."

Those numbers are sure to be helped by Affleck's proclamation that "There's some brief, very brief nudity, I think, in there." And potentially in 3-D.

"It's IMAX penis," he said. "You've gotta pay fifteen bucks to see it in 3-D. It looks better in 3-D."
