(CNN) -- Paul the octopus has plumped for Spain to beat the Netherlands in Sunday's World Cup final in Johannesburg, South Africa.

The psychic cephalopod, which is kept at Sea Life in Oberhausen, western Germany, wasted no time in opening the box in his tank labeled with the Spanish flag.

Paul previously predicted the winners of all of Germany's World Cup matches, creating a huge amount of interest around the world. But this is the first time he has had to choose between two non-German teams.

Staff at the aquarium help Paul make his prediction by lowering two boxes of food into his tank, one with a Spanish flag and the other bearing that of their Dutch opponents.

The case he opens first is adjudged to be his predicted winner.

Would you trust the octopus oracle?

The octopus correctly predicted that Germany would beat Ghana and Australia in the group stages -- but also outwitted most professional pundits by predicting Germany's shock 1-0 defeat by Serbia.

In the knockout stages, Paul tipped Germany to beat both England and Argentina.

But the eight-tentacled oracle drew cries of despair from assembled watchers prior to the semi-final round, when he lingered over the box for the German flag before opting for the Spanish flag instead. Spain won the match 1-0.

However Paul has predicted that Germany will prevail against Uruguay in Saturday's third/fourth place playoff.
