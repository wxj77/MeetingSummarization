(CNN Student News) -- October 2, 2013

With the possibility of a partial U.S. government shutdown now a reality, CNN Student News explains why this doesn't affect paychecks for members of Congress. We also report on some of the world's most valuable brands. And after exploring the Spanish origins of some common English words, we make a Career Connection with a textile director and discover there's more to the fashion world than glitz and glamour.
