(CNN) -- English Premier League leaders Manchester United have confirmed that midfielder Anderson has signed a contract extension that will keep him with the club until June 2015.

The Brazil international, who joined United from Porto in 2007, has been rewarded for some recent superb performances, after returning to the side following a knee ligament injury.

And the 22-year-old was particularly impressive in United's 1-0 win over Arsenal on Monday -- a result that saw Alex Ferguson's side return to the top of the table and keep alive their unbeaten league record this season.

Speaking to the official United website, Ferguson said: "We are delighted he has signed a new contract.

"Anderson has developed tremendously since joining us and he has fantastic potential at only 22 -- he is going to be a really top player."

The player himself added: "This is the best club to be at and I would like to thank everyone for the great support I have received over the years.

"I am looking forward to winning many more trophies with United and I am so pleased to have signed a new deal."

The news ends speculation about Anderson's future, with French side Lyon and Panathinaikos of Greece amongst those rumored to be interested in buying the player.
