(CNN) -- Following in the footsteps of many other celebrities, the miners who spent more than two months trapped underground in a Chilean mine are "going to Disney World."

"The amazing story of these miners captured the attention of the world for demonstrating the true power and resilience of the human spirit," Disney President and CEO Bob Iger said in a statement. "We are proud to welcome these courageous men and their families to the Walt Disney World Resort."

Disney is picking up the tab for the miners, their rescuers and their immediate families during a six-night stay -- January 27 to February 2. Each family will get a $500 gift card. The group will serve as honorary Grand Marshals of a Main Street U.S.A. parade.

The story of the miners, known simply as "the 33" in Chile, transfixed much of the world during their 69 day ordeal about half a mile below ground.

They have been popular on the American talk show circuit since their rescue in October and have been honored by Chilean President Sebastian Pinera and on the "CNN Heroes" show.
