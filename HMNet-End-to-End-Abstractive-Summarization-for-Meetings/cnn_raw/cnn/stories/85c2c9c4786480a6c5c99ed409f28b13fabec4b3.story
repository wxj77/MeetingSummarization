(CNN) -- Presidents John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton all have one.

The late Dwight D. Eisenhower is the latest U.S. president to be honored with an airport. The Wichita City Council voted Tuesday to rename the city's Mid-Continent Airport in honor of the president from Abilene, Kansas.

A local petition was launched last year to rename the airport. The city is constructing a new airport next to the existing one, and Mayor Carl Brewer told CNN it's projected to be completed in March 2015. Federal Aviation Administration and other approvals are still required before the name change takes effect, said Brewer.

"We looked at the president and his contributions to this country," Brewer said. "He was a phenomenal man and president during some challenging times, and (naming the airport after him) was quite fitting."

Last year, Little Rock, Arkansas, officially renamed its airport after former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, the former senator and secretary of state.

Many U.S. airports are named after people whose names aren't quite so familiar. Click through our gallery to see if you know why our airports carry names like "Dulles," "Logan" and Hartsfield."

CNN learned about Wichita's new airport name from a tweet via CNN affiliate KWCH.
