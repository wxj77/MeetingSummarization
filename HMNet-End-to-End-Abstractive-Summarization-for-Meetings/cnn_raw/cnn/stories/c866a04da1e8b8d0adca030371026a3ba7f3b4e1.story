ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Government airstrikes killed 20 Taliban militants in the past 24 hours in northwest Pakistan, a military source said Monday.

Residents sift through the rubble of a bombed out school near Peshawar city.

The airstrikes were launched in the village of Charmang, as part of an attempt to retake small pockets of Bajaur Agency, according to the source.

CNN could not confirm the casualties because of access and safety reasons.

The operation is going on in north and south Waziristan, the source added, particularly to clear supply routes and prepare for a major operation against Pakistan's Taliban chief, Baitullah Mehsud, who has ties to al Qaeda.

The Pakistani military has been conducting an offensive against the Taliban, centered in the Swat region of North West Frontier Province.

Also Monday, a police officer and two civilians were killed when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into a police checkpoint near Peshawar.

And on early Sunday morning, a bomb blast destroyed a girl's school east of Peshawar city, authorities said.

No one was in the school building at the time, but two people who live in houses near the school suffered minor injuries.
