(CNN) -- The FBI is investigating the mysterious death of a 64-year-old woman aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship.

The woman, whose name was not released, was from Midlothian, Virginia. She was found dead by her husband in their cabin Sunday, the cruise line said.

"As is our standard procedure, both the FBI and local law enforcement were notified," Royal Caribbean said.

The couple was traveling on the Enchantment of the Seas ship, which was on a seven-day voyage from Baltimore to Florida and the Bahamas.

The FBI met the ship when it arrived back in Baltimore on Monday.

"We look at any kind of suspicious death on the high seas," said Special Agent Richard Wolf, spokesman for the FBI's Baltimore field office.

He would not specify what made the death suspicious.

Wolf said the woman's autopsy has been completed, but authorities are waiting for results from toxicology tests before a cause of death is determined.
