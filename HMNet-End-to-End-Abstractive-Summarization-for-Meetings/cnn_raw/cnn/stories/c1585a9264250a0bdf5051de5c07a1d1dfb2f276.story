(CNN) -- Last week's Thailand Open champion Guillermo Garcia-Lopez continued his fine run of recent form by reaching the quarterfinals of the Japan Open in Tokyo on Wednesday.

Czech Radek Stepanek is also through to the quarters after Swiss opponent Marco Chiudinelli retired due to a lower back injury.

Stepanek was leading 5-7 7-6 4-1 and had hit 12 aces after two hours and 24 minutes of action.

Meanwhile, Russian Dmitry Tursunov defeated 2007 runner-up Richard Gasquet 7-6 1-6 6-4 in two hours and four minutes reach his first ATP Tour quarterfinal since July 2009 at Indianapolis.

Tursunov will now play either world number one Nadal or Milos Raonic of Canada for a semifinal place.

Elsewhere, recent Metz Open winner Gilles Simon has reached the last eight of the China Open after fighting back to beat German qualifier Michael Berrer, the conqueror of Tomas Berdych in the first round, in three tough sets.

The Frenchman scraped through 6-7 6-4 7-6 in three hours and seven minutes, with the help of 16 aces.

American John Isner is also through to the quarterfinals after winning a big-serving encounter against Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany 7-6 3-6 6-3.

Russian fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko continued his progress with a 7-5 7-5 success over Marin Cilic of Croatia, while top seed Novak Djokovic was handed a bye into the last eight when opponent Mardy Fish was forced to withdraw with an injury to his left ankle.
