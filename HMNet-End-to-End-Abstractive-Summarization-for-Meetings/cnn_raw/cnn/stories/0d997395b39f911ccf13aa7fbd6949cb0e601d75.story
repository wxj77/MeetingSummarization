(BuzzFeed/CNN) -- Whether it's for television or a feature film, it's not easy to pull off a gay role as a straight actor. Many have tried, but it takes a great actor to make the role three dimensional and believable.

Steven Soderbergh's "Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace," which aired on HBO on Sunday, is being lauded by critics, especially for its touching, respectful, and well-rounded performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon.
