(CNN) -- Christopher Lloyd picked through the charred remnants of his Montecito, California, home Monday morning, resigning himself to the fact it cannot be rebuilt.

Christopher Lloyd's $11 million home in Montecito, California, was destroyed by the "Tea Fire."

The "Back to the Future" and "Taxi" star showed ABC's "Good Morning America" what remained of his $11 million home in the exclusive celebrity neighborhood northwest of Los Angeles.

"Boy, look at that," Lloyd said as he approached the rubble. "All this happens in a couple of minutes."

Lloyd's home was among dozens of homes lost in wildfires in Southern California.

The "Tea Fire" which started at the privately owned Tea Garden Estate, about a mile north of Santa Barbara's Westmont College, ripped through an area that Oprah Winfrey, Michael Douglas, Rob Lowe and other celebrities call home.

Lloyd told "Good Morning America" that it was "just sort of sinking in" that his home was gone for good.

"It's amazing, its just gone," Lloyd told "Good Morning America." "Rebuilding would be -- it's too much. You can't rebuild that."

The home's windows were blown out, entire sections demolished, and piles of concrete, ashy trees and shrubbery were scattered across the property.

"You watch TV, you see these kinds of incidents happening here and there, but you look with a kind of detachment because it's happening ... elsewhere," he told "Good Morning America." "But suddenly to be in the midst of it -- it's a very different awareness."

Lloyd joked that he had been planning on organizing and storing memorabilia from the home, but never got around to it.

"Kind of don't have to worry about that now," he said.
