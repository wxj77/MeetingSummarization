(CNN)  -- It was Rahul Dravid, not Indian teammate Sachin Tenduklar, that claimed the batting honors Saturday, but England remained in charge of the first Test at Lord's.

Dravid reached his first Test century at the home of cricket, while Tendulkar made 34 as he bid for his 100th century in Tests.

Despite their efforts, India were bowled out for 286 and England had extended their lead to 193 by the close of the third day, having reached five without loss in their second innings.

The 38-year-old Dravid was left undefeated on 103, 15 years after he was dismissed for 95 on his debut at Lord's.

His 33rd hundred in 154 Tests and fifth against England helped India avoid the follow on.

Tendulkar, who received a standing ovation in probably his final Test series in England, looked in fine touch, but eventually fell to Stuart Broad, who led England's attack with four for 37 in 22 overs.

He was well held by Graeme Swann at slip, to the delight of the bowler.

"Of course it was lovely to get Sachin but I'd say the same about any leader of any batting line-up," Broad told Sky Sports.

England, looking to win the four-match series by two clear wins to overtake India as world number one in Tests, were further boosted when India's leading strike bowler Zaheer Khan did not come out for the start of their second knock.

Zaheer pulled his hamstring on the first day and has been receiving extensive treatment for the injury.

England captain Andrew Strauss was three not out and Alastair Cook unbeaten with scoring and the pair will look to push on Sunday as they build to a possible declaration.
