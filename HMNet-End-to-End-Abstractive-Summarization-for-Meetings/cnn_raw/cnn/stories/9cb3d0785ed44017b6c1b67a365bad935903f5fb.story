(CNN Student News) -- September 30, 2013

This Monday, CNN Student News reports on a new development in Washington's "shutdown showdown," and we examine the science and the doubt concerning humans' potential impact on climate change. We also step inside a top-secret forensics lab to see how a shred of evidence can help track down a terrorist, and we introduce a CNN Hero who's helped others walk in his shoes.
