As we all know, Thanksgiving isn't always the harmonious holiday it's sometimes made out to be.

Stick a bunch of relatives together in the same house, add menu planning and alcohol, and things can get a little snippy.

Many people have strong opinions about how to cook the turkey, what side dishes to serve and who has to clean up. Family traditions die hard and new ideas aren't always welcome.

"I know you don't like creamed pearled onions, but we've had creamed pearled onions at our Thanksgiving table since I was a little girl and we're not about to stop now. I had to suffer, so we're all going to suffer."

And don't get us started on the potatoes.

Then there are broader questions of Thanksgiving Day etiquette. Some families break out the fine china and dress up for dinner, while others eat on paper plates in front of the TV.

Some of us watch football, while others hold annual viewings of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles." (Those aren't pillows! Still funny every time.)

And, as stores open earlier and earlier to chase those Black Friday dollars, there's even a formerly unheard-of question for families to grapple with: Is it OK to go holiday shopping on Thanksgiving?

Nobody wants to squabble on a holiday, but some family feuds are inevitable. See our gallery above for the things you're most likely to bicker about on Thursday. And no, you shouldn't ever go holiday  shopping on Thanksgiving.
