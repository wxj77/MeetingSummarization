(CNN) -- In April of this year the world was shocked to learn that Boko Haram had abducted 276 Nigerian schoolgirls from their boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 are still missing.

Despite international outrage and a viral campaign calling for action, the girls remained missing.

CNN's Senior International Correspondent Arwa Damon reflected on traveling through West Africa and meeting Boko Haram's terrified victims.

Two months after the kidnapping, CNN asked you to share your messages of hope for family and friends of the missing schoolgirls.

While some tweeted messages of support, others expressed frustration over the Nigerian government's handling of the situation.

From Africa and beyond, here's a roundup of some tweets you sent us along with other messages from the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.
