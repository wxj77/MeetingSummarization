(CNN) -- Awards season isn't over yet.

MTV has announced its own list of film nominees for its 2014 Movie Awards, and you won't be surprised to find that some of the biggest titles at the Oscars are also up for MTV's golden popcorn trophy.

In the movie of the year category, the Academy Awards' best picture winner "12 Years A Slave" is competing against "American Hustle," "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" and "The Wolf of Wall Street."

This isn't the first time Oscar favorites have competed against fan-fueled franchises, as last year's movie of the year category pitted "Silver Linings Playbook" and "Django Unchained" against "Ted" and "Marvel's The Avengers."

Given that it was Joss Whedon's critically praised blockbuster "Avengers" that won the best of the year honor, we'd venture to say that an Oscar nod doesn't mean success at MTV's ceremony.

In addition to categorical mainstays like best film, best actor and best actress, MTV's show is also known for its offbeat categories, like best on-screen duo, best #wtf moment, best kiss and best shirtless performance.

Interestingly, in this year's best on-screen duo category, there's a posthumous entry: late actor Paul Walker is nominated with his "Fast & Furious" franchise co-star Vin Diesel for 2013's "Fast & Furious 6."
