Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The trial of American hikers charged with espionage in Iran will resume May 11, the state run Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday, citing the head of the Justice Ministry.

The trial began behind closed-doors last month, and allowed Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal "the opportunity to explain their innocence to the court," according to February 7 statement from the men's families.

Iran accuses Bauer, 28, Fattal, 28, and Sarah Shourd, 32, of spying and trespassing. They were detained July 31, 2009, after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region.

Shourd was released on bail in September 2010 because of a medical condition and immediately left the country. She has not responded to a court summons to return to stand trial, Masoud Shafii, the hikers' attorney in Tehran, has said.

Iranian authorities say she will be tried in absentia if she doesn't appear in court.

All three have pleaded not guilty. Fattal and Bauer continue to be held in Iran's notorious Evin prison.
