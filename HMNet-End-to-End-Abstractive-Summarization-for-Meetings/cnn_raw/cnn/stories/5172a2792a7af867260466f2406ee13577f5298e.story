(CNN) -- "She said YES!!!"

That was the tweet that NBA star Dwyane Wade used Saturday to announce his engagement to actress Gabrielle Union.

Wade made the announcement via Twitter and Instagram, posting a photo of the stunning solitaire diamond.

Wade, 31, a guard with the Miami Heat, and the 41-year-old Union have been dating several years.

Among Wade's many accomplishments, according to his website, are winning a gold medal in the 2008 Olympics, being named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People and earning back-to-back NBA championship rings -- in 2012 and 2013.

Union may be best known for some of her film roles, including "Bring It On", "Meet Dave" and "10 Things I Hate About You."

There's no word yet whether the couple has set a date.

CNN's Jillian Martin contributed to this report.
