New York (CNN) -- More than 35 pounds of cocaine was discovered in at least one bag that turned up at the United Nations headquarters in New York, police said Thursday.

The narcotics were uncovered on January 16 inside hollowed-out books that had been shipped from Mexico City in a bag made to look like a diplomatic pouch, according to New York police spokesman Paul Browne.

"The actual pouch is blue and has a U.N. symbol, a lock and seal, and words like "Diplomatic Mail," Browne said. "This bag was white instead of blue and had no locked seal and no wording of any kind."

The bag was being screened at the United Nations' postal receiving center when the cocaine was discovered.

It lacked a destination address and was without a return address, Browne added.

U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said, "This was not connected to the United Nations, and that's why the host government, the city authorities, in the shape of the NYPD, were brought in to assist."

He said that it "was not a diplomatic pouch."

In a written statement, Nesirky noted that "two suspicious mail bags were intercepted."

Authorities have not located the intended recipient, he said.
