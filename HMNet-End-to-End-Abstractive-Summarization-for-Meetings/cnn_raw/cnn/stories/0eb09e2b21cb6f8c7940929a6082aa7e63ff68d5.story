(CNN)  -- Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic extended his 15-match unbeaten run with a straight sets win over Kazakhstan's Andrey Golubev at Indian Wells.

After receiving a bye in the first round of the Masters event, the in-form Serbian took less than an hour to brush aside his 39th-ranked opponent 6-0 6-4 on Sunday.

"It was great start of the tournament, world No. 3 Djokovic said. "With those first matches you don't know what to expect. But I was in the control most of the match."

World No. 2 Roger Federer also progressed to the third round of the Californian hard-court tournament, with a straight sets triumph over Igor Andreev.

However, the Swiss 16-time grand slam champion was made to work hard for his 7-5 7-6 (4) victory over the Russian world No. 96.

"He found his way into the match and it really became competitive," Federer said. "It was a good end to the match on both sides."

Former U.S. Open champion Andy Roddick had to battle through a tough second set to defeat fellow American James Blake 6-3 7-5.

Roddick will face another compatriot, big-serving John Isner in the third-round, after the 30th ranked player knocked out Brazilian Ricardo Mello 6-3 7-6.

World No. 10 Jurgen Melzer and 12th-ranked Stanislas Wawrinka both had to overcome the loss of the opening set to book their places in the third round draw.

Austria's Melzer eventually made it past Frenchman Julien Benneteau 1-6 6-1 6-4, while Switzerland's Wawrinka upset former world No. 3 Nikolay Davydenko 3-6 7-6 (5) 6-4.

The 2010 Wimbledon runner-up and world No. 7 Tomas Berdych had an easier passage through to the next round -- with a straightforward 6-4 6-1 win over Poland's Lukasz Kubot.

The biggest surprise of the day came courtesy of 20-year-old Canadian rising star Milos Raonic who knocked out the American 2008 finalist and world No. 15 Mardy Fish 7-5 6-4.

Raonic will play American teenager Ryan Harrison in the third round, after the 18-year-old recorded a 6-3 7-6 (4) win over No. 22 seed Guillermo Garcia Lopez of Spain.
