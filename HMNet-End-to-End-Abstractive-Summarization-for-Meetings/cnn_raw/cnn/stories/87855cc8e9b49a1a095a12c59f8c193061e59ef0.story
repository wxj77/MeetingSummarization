(CNN) -- Doctors said Wednesday the prognosis is excellent for California Gov. Jerry Brown, who is undergoing treatment for localized prostate cancer.

"Fortunately, this is early-stage localized prostate cancer, which is being treated with a short course of conventional radiotherapy," said oncologist Dr. Eric Small of the University of California, San Francisco, according to a statement from Brown's office.

Brown, 74, is maintaining a full work schedule and is not expected to have significant side effects from the treatment, which is expected to be completed in early January, his office said.
