SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- One could say she has the determination ... but lacks the drive.

Driving agency estimates woman has spent more than $2,888 in exam fees.

A 68-year-old South Korean woman this week signed up to take her driving test once again -- after failing to earn a license the first 771 times.

The woman, identified only as Cha, first took the written portion of the exam in April 2005, said Choi Young-cheol of the Driver's License Agency in the southwestern city of Jeonju.

At the time, she made her living selling goods door-to-door and figured she would need a car to help her get around, Choi told CNN.

She failed the test. She retook the test the next day and failed again. And again. And again.

"You have to get at least 60 points to pass the written part," said Kim Rahn, who wrote about the unflappable woman in the Korea Times, an English-language daily. "She usually gets under 50."

In the beginning, Cha went to the license office almost every day. Now, she no longer works but still turns up once a week, Choi said.

The office estimates she has spent more than 4 million won ($2,888) in exam fees.

Cha's last failed attempt was Monday.

She tries for the 772nd time either Thursday or Friday.
