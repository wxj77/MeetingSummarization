(CNN) -- Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim came out of hiding Monday, and says he has damaging evidence that proves senior members of the government faked evidence for sodomy charges against him.

Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim says he has proof sodomy charges against him were fabricated.

"I have new evidence about the fabrication of evidence against me in 1998," Anwar told CNN Monday. "I totally reject these malicious attacks."

Anwar was the heir apparent to former premier Mahathir Mohamad until 1998, when he was sacked and charged for corruption and sodomy.

The sodomy conviction was overturned, but the corruption verdict was never lifted, barring him from running for political post until this year.

In the CNN interview, Anwar rejected the sodomy charges and also said he had evidence of threats on his life that caused him to go into hiding at the Turkish embassy in Kuala Lumpur.  Listen to Anwar Ibrahim defend himself Â»

CNN could not immediately reach members of Malaysia's ruling party.

The ruling party, National Front Coalition, has led Malaysia since the country declared independence in 1957. Anwar's opposition party has gradually chipped away at the National Front's power.

Recently Malaysian police have said they are investigating a new sodomy charge against him, Anwar said.

The new charges were also false and were fabricated to usurp his political gains, Anwar said.

"I will challenge these attacks on every ground," Anwar said.
