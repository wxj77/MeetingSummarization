Hours before her wedding to New Jersey Nets basketball player Kris Humphries, Kardashian gushed on her blog, saying "I can't believe it's finally here!"

Two of her sisters -- Khloe and Kourtney, both fellow reality television stars and partners in retail and other projects -- took to social media to echo the bride-to-be's excitement.

"My sister's getting married today!!!" Khloe Kardashian tweeted, later linking to a web posting dedicated to "Kimmie."

"Since we were little girls, you have been dreaming about your perfect, fairytale wedding, and today we all get to watch as those dreams become your perfect reality," Khloe Kardashian wrote. "Watching you, the ultimate believer in true love, fall head over heels for your prince charming has been so special for everyone who knows and loves you. You deserve everything wonderful in the world, and I have no doubt that you will get exactly that after you walk down the aisle tonight."
