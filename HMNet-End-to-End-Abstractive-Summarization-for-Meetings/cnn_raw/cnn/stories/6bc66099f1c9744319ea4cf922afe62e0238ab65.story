Does this bizarre-looking fish look familiar to you?

The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute captured what it says are the first images and video of a female anglerfish, known as a Black Seadevil.

With its jaw agape, exposing what appear to be fangs, it lives up to the name "Seadevil."

But if you've seen the 2003 Pixar classic, "Finding Nemo," you might recognize the Seadevil as the fish that creeps up on an unsuspecting Nemo and Dory.

The institute located the fish on a voyage with Doc Ricketts, their remotely operated vehicle, during a "midwater transect."

"This means we 'fly' the robot through the water at a series of different depths (10 minutes at each depth), and count all the different types of animals we see," said institute spokeswoman Kim Fulton-Bennett.

These transects have been taking place for over 20 years, and the Seadevil was certainly a big find.

Though it won't win any beauty pageants, this creature just goes to show how there are still plenty of fish in the sea waiting to be discovered.
