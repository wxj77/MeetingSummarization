(CNN) -- Former teen idol David Cassidy faces a drunken driving charge after his arrest early Wednesday in Schodack, New York, police said.

Cassidy, 63, was given breath and field sobriety tests after he failed to dim his car's headlights at a police checkpoint, according to the police report. Word of the arrest surfaced on Twitter, starting with early tweets from local TV reporter Jessica Layton.

He was arrested when he blew a .10 in the Breathalyzer device, the report said. The legal blood alcohol limit is .08.

The former star of the TV series "The Partridge Family" was released on $2,500 bail and ordered to appear in court on September 6, the police report said.

Cassidy, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, entered a no contest plea as a first-time offender in February 2011 to a drunken driving charge that followed a November 2010 arrest in Florida. He was sentenced to a year's probation and his driver's license was suspended for six months for that conviction. He also attended a DUI school, paid a $500 fine and served 50 hours of community service.

On the TV series, Cassidy played the eldest of five children of a widowed mother (Shirley Jones, who was Cassidy's real-life stepmother). The family, all musicians, traveled to gigs in a repainted school bus. When the show was canceled after four seasons, Cassidy launched his own pop music career, filling concert halls with screaming teenage girls attracted to such hits as "I Think I Love You."

A more recent acting job was on the 2009 ABC Family sitcom "Ruby & the Rockits," in which Cassidy played an aging former teen heartthrob. The show was canceled after one season.

CNN's Topher Gauk-Roger contributed to this report.
