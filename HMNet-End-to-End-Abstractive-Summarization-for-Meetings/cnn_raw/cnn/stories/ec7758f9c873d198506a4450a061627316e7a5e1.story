(CNN) -- As expected, Katie Couric is leaving CBS Evening News, her representative, Matthew Hiltzik, told CNN on Tuesday.

After weeks of speculation, Couric broke the news in an exclusive interview with People magazine.

"The bottom line is that I love doing all kinds of different stories," Couric told People. "I have a lot of areas of interest and I want to be able to fulfill all of that."

Couric told People she is considering a show format that will allow her to "engage in in more multidimensional storytelling."

She said details are still being worked out.

Couric, 54, took over the CBS news show in 2006. She previously worked for NBC, and was co-host of NBC's "Today" show for 15 years before leaving for CBS.
