(EW.com) -- Disney's $250 million sci-fi epic "John Carter" earned an underwhelming $500,000 at midnight showings, the studio confirmed.

According to Disney, that figure is in line with what 2010â€²s "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" earned. That movie, also a costly adventure flick, wound up debuting to $30.1 million -- and Disney would really like to see a "3â€³ in front of John Carter's weekend gross.

But it's still way too early to tell, as midnight figures cannot be entirely trusted. After all, just last Friday, "Project X" took in $1.2 million at midnight screenings en route to a $21.1 million weekend. Admittedly, "Project X" is a more midnight-friendly movie than "John Carter," but then consider last year's action fantasy Immortals, which grossed $1.4 million at midnight showings and finished its first weekend with $32.2 million.

However "John Carter" performs this weekend (we're predicting a $26 million debut), the movie will likely find a bit more love overseas. Disney announced that the film already posted the biggest opening day ever in Russia with a projected $6.5 million.
