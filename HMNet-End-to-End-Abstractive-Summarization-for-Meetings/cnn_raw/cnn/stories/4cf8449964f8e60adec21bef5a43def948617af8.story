(EW.com) -- After months of speculation about who would play the villain in the next James Bond installment, we finally have an answer, friendo: Javier Bardem.

During an interview with Christiane Amanpour on Nightline, in which the Spanish actor talked about his involvement with a charity to help west Saharan refugees, Bardem confirmed that he would be playing the bad guy in "Bond 23."

"I am very excited. My parents took me to watch the movies and I saw all of them. So to play that is going to be fun," Bardem said about his joining the 00-franchise. "They chose me to play this man, but I cannot give you many details."
