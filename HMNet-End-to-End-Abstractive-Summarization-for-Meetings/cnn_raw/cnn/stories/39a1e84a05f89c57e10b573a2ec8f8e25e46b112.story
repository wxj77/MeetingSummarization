(Hong Kong) (CNN) -- In the age of fat payouts and lucrative perks for company executives, the CEO of Lenovo is getting attention for how he used his bonus.

Yang Yuanqing distributed $3 million from his bonus among 10,000 junior-level employees, the China-based technology company confirmed Thursday. The employees, such as receptionists, production-line workers and assistants, each received an average bonus of 2,000 yuan, which is $314, in the name of their CEO.

Yang had received the additional $3 million boost in his bonus after the company had its best fiscal year ending in March.

The $30 billion personal technology company saw a 73% bump in net profit from the previous year, which Yang had described as a "record-setting year for Lenovo," according to a press release.

Yang had earned $5.2 million in bonuses for the fiscal year ending in March. His total earnings, including salary, incentives and other benefits, amounted to $14 million, according to the company's annual report.
