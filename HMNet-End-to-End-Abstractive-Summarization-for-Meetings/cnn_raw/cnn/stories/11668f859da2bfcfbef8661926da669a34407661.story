(CNN) -- Oracle Team USA safely negotiated the choppy waters of sporting comebacks to pull off a memorable victory against New Zealand to defend the America's Cup.

The crew, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison, had looked sunk as they trailed 8-1 in the best-of-17-races elite sailing series.

Down but not out, Team USA continued to develop their boat with the help of their land crew and made another key decision when Britain's Olympic champion sailor Ben Ainslie replaced John Kostecki as key tactician at 4-1 down.

But are technical updates and staff changes what true sporting comebacks are made of?

In the gallery above, CNN World Sport examines the ingredients of some of sport's most tantalizing turnarounds -- from teamwork to the indomitable spirit of a single human soul.
