(CNN) -- Dancers have put on a dazzling display atop extravagant floats at the legendary annual Rio Carnival. Thousands of revelers cheered as dancers shimmied and shook their colorful costumes through the streets of the Brazilian city.

Seven-year-old Julia Lira took her place as the drum corps queen for the Viradouro School of Samba despite criticism that she was too young to fill a role normally reserved for voluptuous adult dancers.
