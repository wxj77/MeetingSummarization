(CNN)Toledo, Ohio, Mayor Michael Collins has been hospitalized in critical condition after suffering a cardiac arrest while driving Sunday afternoon.

Collins was headed home from a news conference on the city's snow emergency around 2 p.m. when he lost consciousness and his car slammed into a utility pole, said his spokeswoman Stacy Weber.

CNN affiliate WTVG said a woman performed CPR on the mayor after breaking a window and removing him from the vehicle.

Collins is in the intensive care unit at the University of Toledo Medical Center.

Dr. Christopher Cooper of the medical center said Sunday that Collins is being closely monitored and that it is too early to comment about his recovery.

City Council President Paula Hicks-Hudson was sworn in as acting mayor.

Collins, 70, has been in office a little over a year.

CNN's Janet DiGiacomo and Andy Rose contributed to this report.
