"Viewers will get to meet Luke Cage in 'Marvel's A.K.A. Jessica Jones,' and experience why he is such an important super hero in the Marvel mythos."

Meanwhile, "Doctor Strange" director Scott Derrickson teased fans of that film by tweeting an image of Cumberbatch as the character with the Talking Heads lyric "Strange but not a stranger."
