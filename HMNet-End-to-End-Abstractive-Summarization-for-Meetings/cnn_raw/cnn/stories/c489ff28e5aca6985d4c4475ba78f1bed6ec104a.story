(CNN) -- Rubber ducky, you ARE the one -- the chosen one, that is, for this year's induction into the National Toy Hall of Fame.

The rubber duck shares the honor with the game of chess as a fellow 2013 inductee, announced today on the hall's website.

Inductees are selected on the basis of several factors including icon-status, longevity and innovation.

Rubber duck and chess squeaked and check mated past 10 other finalists, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Pac-Man and My Little Pony to win this year's honor.

Toys previously inducted into the Hall of Fame include Monopoly (1998), roller Skates (1999), jack-in-the-box (2005) and last year's inductees: Star Wars action figures and dominoes.

The National Toy Hall of Fame is in Rochester, New York.
