(CNN) -- Rock 'n' roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis is married for a seventh time -- this time to the ex-wife of a cousin whose sister Lewis wed when she was 13 -- his representative said Thursday.

Lewis, 76, married Judith Brown, who was previously married to his cousin, Rusty, on March 9 in Natchez, Mississippi, according to his representative Maureen O'Connor.

The flamboyant piano player known as "The Killer" pushed the rock envelope with his 1957 hit singles "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" and "Great Balls of Fire," but marital scandal stalled his career. His third marriage (when he was 23) was to a 13-year-old cousin, Myra Gale Brown.

Rusty Brown is Myra Gale Brown's brother, O'Connor said.

Lewis and his sixth wife, Kerrie McCarver, were married for 20 years and had a child. They were divorced in 2004, according to Spinner.com.
