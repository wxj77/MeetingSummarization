Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman has signed on to "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" as Plutarch Heavensbee, the politically crafty Head Gamemaker who oversees the 75th Annual Hunger Games, Lionsgate announced Monday.

Hoffman is the first new actor to officially join the wildly popular franchise, alongside stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland.

Actress Jena Malone has reportedly signed up to play tribute Johanna Mason — EW first reported that Malone was in the running for the role — but Lionsgate has yet to confirm that casting.

Director Francis Lawrence is aiming to start shooting "Catching Fire" later this year. Along with Hoffman's casting, the studio also released its first official synopsis for the film, based on the best-selling novel by Suzanne Collins. Check it out below:

"'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' begins as Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark. Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a 'Victor's Tour' of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games (The Quarter Quell) — a competition that could change Panem forever."

"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" is set to hit theaters on November 22, 2013.
