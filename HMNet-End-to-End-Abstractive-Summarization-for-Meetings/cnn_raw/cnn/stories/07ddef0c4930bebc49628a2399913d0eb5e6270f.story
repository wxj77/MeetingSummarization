(CNN) -- Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was at home Saturday after leaving a hospital where he underwent surgery for prostate cancer this week.

"A million thanks to everyone for their support and solidarity," the president wrote on his official Twitter page.

On Monday, Santos announced that he had prostate cancer, but described the tumor as "small" and "not aggressive." He underwent surgery Wednesday at a hospital in Bogota, Colombia's capital.

Upon leaving the hospital, Santos spoke to reporters, according to CNN affiliate Caracol.

The 61-year-old president said the tumor had not metastasized.

"In other words, I'm totally cured," Santos said.

The news comes about one week before the government is expected to start peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC.

Talks to end the nearly 50-year war are set to begin in Oslo, Norway, on October 14, Caracol reported. They had previously been scheduled to start Monday.

Recently, doctors have diagnosed several current and former South American leaders with cancer.

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez first announced his diagnosis last year, though neither he nor anyone in his government has specified the type of cancer.

Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff overcame cancer while she was a candidate for the office, and former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva underwent treatment for throat cancer.

Then-Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2010, while Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was treated for thyroid cancer this year.
