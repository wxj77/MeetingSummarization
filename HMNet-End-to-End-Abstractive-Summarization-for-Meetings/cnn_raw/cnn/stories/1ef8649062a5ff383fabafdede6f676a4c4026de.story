(CNN Student News) -- Students will learn about political parties in the United States.

Procedure

Ask students: What is a political party? What role do political parties play in the U.S. presidential election process? Point out that although the Democratic and Republican parties currently dominate the political scene, other parties have nominated individuals for president throughout U.S. history. Have students select a political party that has nominated a candidate for president at any point in U.S. history. Students may want to consider parties such as the Libertarian party, the Whig party, the Green party, and the Bull Moose party.

Next, hand out copies of the Political Party Profile Worksheet. Direct students to fill in the worksheet, using their textbooks or online resources to research their chosen parties. Using his or her findings, each student should compose a one-minute speech for a presidential candidate from the party. The speech should touch on major points of the party's history and where it stands on the issues.

Extension:

Challenge your students to use original video, music, animation and other production elements to create their own "Talking Democracy" iReports that explain or demonstrate the concept of political parties. The videos should be three minutes or less in length and can be submitted here. The best videos may appear on CNN Student News!
