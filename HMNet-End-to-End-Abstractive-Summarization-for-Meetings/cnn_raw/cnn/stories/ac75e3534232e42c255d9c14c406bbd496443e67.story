A 34-year-old man originally charged in the kidnapping of a New Hampshire teen is now facing 205 additional charges, according to two grand jury rulings.

Nathaniel E. Kibby, arrested in July and charged with one count of felony kidnapping, is facing a litany of charges including aggravated felonious sexual assault, witness tampering, second degree assault, criminal threatening, felonious use of a firearm, indecent exposure and kidnapping.

Court papers released Wednesday say Kibby showed the victim a rifle and told her he could hurt her family, bystanders and police if she provided information about his identity.

Additionally, Kibby is accused of forcing the victim to wear an anti-bark shock dog collar for a period, scarring her neck.

CNN does not report the names of alleged sexual assault victims.

The kidnapping case drew national attention when the then-14-year-old victim went missing in fall 2013. Two months after her disappearance, a letter purported to be from the missing teenager was sent to her mother, sparking fears she could be in danger. The mystery deepened about her ordeal when she turned up safe more than nine months after she was last seen with few additional details given by authorities.

Kibby will be arraigned on January 8 in Coos County, where the victim was held, and January 9 in Carroll County, where the victim was taken, according to prosecutors.

In a statement released after her return in July, the victim thanked those who searched for her while she was missing.

"My gratitude is beyond words. It's an incredible feeling to be home and I believe in my heart that your hopes and prayers played a major role in my release," she said.
