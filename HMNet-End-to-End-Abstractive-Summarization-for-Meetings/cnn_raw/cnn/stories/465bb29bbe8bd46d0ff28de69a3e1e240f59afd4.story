(EW.com) -- It's been a good month for Quvenzhané Wallis!

Not only is the actress, now 9, the youngest-ever Best Actress nominee for her role in "Beasts of the Southern Wild," but EW has learned that she's in consideration to star in Sony's upcoming remake of the Broadway musical "Annie."

A studio rep stresses, though, that newly named director Will Gluck ("Easy A") and the producers at Will Smith's Overbrook Entertainment banner and Jay-Z's Marcy Media, which have been developing the project, have yet to make any casting decisions.

The film had initially been developed as a potential starring vehicle for Smith's now-12-year-old daughter, Willow, who dropped out of the project last month after aging out of the role.

The elder Smith recently told Temple University: "Willow was supposed to be doing Annie, we got Jay-Z to do the movie, go the studio to come in and Willow had such a difficult time on tour with 'Whip my Hair' and she said, 'You know Daddy,' I don't think so," Smith said, adding that his daughter also told him, "I have a better idea, how about I just be 12."
