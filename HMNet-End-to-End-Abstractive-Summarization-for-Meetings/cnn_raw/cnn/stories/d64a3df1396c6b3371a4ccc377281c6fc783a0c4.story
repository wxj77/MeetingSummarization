(CNN) -- MotoGP world champion Jorge Lorenzo will be kept under observation in hospital after flying off his bike in a 200-kilometers an hour crash during a wet practice session at Assen Thursday.

Lorenzo will miss Saturday's race in the Netherlands after being caught out by standing water on the track and flying over his handlebars, eventually landing heavily on his left shoulder and fracturing his collarbone.

The Spaniard, who won in Spain and Italy, came off during the second session of practice at Turn 13.

According to race organizers, Lorenzo will be flown to Barcelona for surgery late Saturday or early Sunday.

Xavier Mir, the doctor who carried out the examination on Lorenzo, confirmed the rider would undergo scans and be kept in for observation.

"Jorge has suffered an accident at over 200 kilometers an hour and the obvious injury at this point is a broken left clavicle," he told the competition's official website.

"However, as this was a significant accident, we have to take into account that there could also be head, thoracic or abdominal injuries.

"For now, we have taken him to hospital in Assen where CT scans will be carried out in those three areas to rule out any further injuries.

"It would also be a prudent move to observe him over 12 hours to make sure he can be treated by the appropriate parties when he arrives in Barcelona tomorrow (Friday)."

Lorenzo had moved to within seven points of world championship leader Dani Pedrosa following his recent victories.

But he will now have to watch from the sidelines at a venue where he failed to make it past the first corner last year.
