(CNN) -- Hundreds of protesters tried to make their way to the U.S. Consulate in the Pakistani city of Karachi on Sunday but were pushed back by police.

Pakistani television showed protesters running from baton-wielding officers. Some demonstrators threw rocks at the officers; in some case, officers threw rocks back.

Some police fired shots in the air and used water cannons, according to Haider Ali, a witness at the scene.

Sharfuddin Memon, spokesman for Sindh Province, said the protesters numbered in the hundreds. There were several clashes between police and protesters, leaving some demonstrators injured, Memon said.

Some protesters threw rocks and other objects that hit the consulate building, said Rian Harris, spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan. Some walls may have been damaged, she said.

The consulate took proper safety measures, Harris said.
