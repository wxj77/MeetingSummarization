(EW.com) -- "The Artist" and "Hugo" continued their domination of the early awards season, each racking up 11 Critics' Choice nominations from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, perhaps the only critics group that presages the Academy Award nominations with any accuracy.

"Drive" and "The Help" each scored eight nods, while "The Descendants" and "War Horse" received seven. Also in the BFCA's Best Picture top 10: "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close," "Midnight in Paris," "Moneyball," and "The Tree of Life." (Not included, meanwhile: "Bridesmaids," "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2," "The Ides of March," and "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.")

Amongst the surprises in the acting categories: "Drive's" Ryan Gosling over "Tinker Tailor's" Gary Oldman, "Martha Marcy May Marlene's" Elizabeth Olsen over "Albert Nobbs'" Glenn Close, and three previously dark-horse Best Supporting Actor candidates: "Young Adult's" Patton Oswalt, "Warrior's" Nick Nolte, and "Rise of the Planet of the Apes'" Andy Serkis. And interestingly, although the BFCA did nominate Noomi Rapace last year for Best Actress for the Swedish version of "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," Rooney Mara was overlooked for her performance in David Fincher's remake.
