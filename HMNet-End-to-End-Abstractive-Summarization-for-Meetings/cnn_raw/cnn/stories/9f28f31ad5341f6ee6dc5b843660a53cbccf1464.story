(CNN) -- Each week African Voices brings you inspiring and compelling profiles of Africans across the continent and around the world. Now, we want to hear from you. Let us know which African you most admire, and why. Your comments could end up on a future episode of African Voices.

There are some obvious choices -- Nobel Prize winners such as Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, who have tirelessly fought for human rights, or those like Wangari Maathai, who have helped change attitudes towards the environment.

But the African you admire needn't be a politician or activist. They could be an artist, author, athlete or musician, who has inspired or moved you in some way.

They needn't even be famous. How about someone you work with, a neighbor or family member, who is doing what they can to help make their country or community a better place?

So let us know which Africans you most admire, and why, by leaving a comment below.
