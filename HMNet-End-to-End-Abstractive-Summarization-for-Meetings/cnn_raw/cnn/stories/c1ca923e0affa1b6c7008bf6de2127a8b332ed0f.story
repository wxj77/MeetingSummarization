(CNN) -- A Delaware pediatrician was indicted Wednesday on 58 additional counts of rape and other sexual offenses in the alleged child abuse of his patients, state Attorney General Beau Biden announced Monday.

Dr. Earl Bradley, 56, previously pleaded not guilty to 471 felony counts involving 102 girls and one boy.

Wednesday's indictment -- which includes charges of rape, unlawful sexual contact, continuous sexual abuse of a child and sexual exploitation -- involves 24 girls he saw as patients from 1999 to 2009.

Biden has said the charges are based on "video and digital evidence" seized from Bradley's home and medical practice in December, when the doctor was arrested.

Bradley, whose practice was in Lewes, Delaware, also has medical licenses in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Florida. Authorities have said they have contacted officials in those states.

In a February 24 interview with CNN, Bradley's attorney said he would base his client's defense on mental health.

"Most of the evidence in this case comes from videotapes -- it's kind of hard to argue with videotapes," Eugene Maurer Jr. said. He added, "The issue in this case is going to come down to his mental health at the time."
