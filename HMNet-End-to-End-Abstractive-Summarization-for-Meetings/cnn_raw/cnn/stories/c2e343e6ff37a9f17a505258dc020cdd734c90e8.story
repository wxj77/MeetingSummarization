Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Taliban has killed four members of an international landmine clearing agency working in western Afghanistan, an official with the group said Monday.

"The Taliban killed four demining staff of the Demining Agency for Afghanistan, including two team leaders, a paramedic and a section leader," according to Mohammad Dawood Farahi, operation Manager of Demining Agency for Afghanistan.

Thirty-one people working for the non-governmental agency were kidnapped in Farah province Wednesday.

Twenty-seven people were set free, but given a warning.

"The released deminers were warned by the Taliban to not work for any domestic and foreign organization in the future," Farahi said.

Naqibullah Farahi, a spokesman for the governor of Farah province, had earlier confirmed the death of one member of the group.

"The Taliban killed a team leader of the DAFA in Shamalgah village of Farah city on Saturday," he said.
