(CNN) -- A Saudi man wanted in connection with terror activities has surrendered to authorities, a Saudi Interior Ministry spokesman told CNN Tuesday.

He is Badr M. Alshehri, whose name is on the list of those most wanted by Saudi Arabia, said Maj. Gen. Mansour Al-Turki, a spokesman for the kingdom's Interior Ministry. Alshehri was on the list of 85 wanted people, the Saudi Press Agency reported.

"Alshehri's return to the Kingdom was arranged and coordinated by Saudi security forces and security agencies in Pakistan," said Al-Turki, who couldn't comment on where Alshehri was when he surrendered.

Al-Turki told CNN that Alshehri had reached out to his family in Saudi Arabia and told them "he wanted to surrender himself to Saudi authorities and come back to the kingdom."

According to Al-Turki, Alshehri's family then got in touch with Interior Ministry and began coordinating how the surrender would happen. He's been in Saudi Arabia now for a few days.
