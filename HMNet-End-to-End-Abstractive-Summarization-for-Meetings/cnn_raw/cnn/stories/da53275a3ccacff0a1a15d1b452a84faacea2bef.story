(CNN) -- A 3.4-magnitude earthquake rumbled through northern California early Sunday, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

The quake hit 5 miles southwest of Napa, the center of California's famed wine country.

There are no reports of damage so far, the Napa County Sheriff's Office said.

It comes a week after a 6.0-magnitude quake -- the strongest in northern California in a quarter of a century -- struck the same area on August 24.

Last week's quake injured dozens, damaged historic buildings in downtown Napa and turned fireplaces into rubble. It also caused at least $1 billion in property damage in Napa and other communities.

The two earthquakes were a little over a mile from each other.
