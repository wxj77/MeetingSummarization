New York (CNN) -- Boston police say they've apprehended a Red Sox employee who absconded earlier with the costume of the team's beloved mascot, Wally the Green Monster.

The man has not been charged, police said Friday.

He was picked up while heading toward downtown Boston with what's described as a furry creature with a permanent grin, extremely large head, and green and orange hair, wearing a number 97 uniform.

Earlier Friday, police put out a bulletin on Twitter asking the public for help.

"Missing: Wally the Green Monster, If seen please call Boston Police," authorities tweeted.

Police tweet: "Wally found!"

Police said they canvassed "all establishments the monster is known to frequent," before detectives uncovered his whereabouts.

"It was just a big misunderstanding," said Zineb Curran, a Boston Red Sox spokeswoman. "A staff member took it out early for some scheduled appearances and then decided to walk around Boston with the costume."

"We just weren't aware of it," she said. "And Wally is safe."

Named after the 37-foot green wall in left field at Fenway Park, Wally made his first official appearance to fans in 1997.

The team is currently in last place in the American League East, even though it is only a game below .500, with 49 wins and 50 losses. The BoSox are set to square off against their arch rival, the New York Yankees, at 7:05 p.m. ET Friday.
