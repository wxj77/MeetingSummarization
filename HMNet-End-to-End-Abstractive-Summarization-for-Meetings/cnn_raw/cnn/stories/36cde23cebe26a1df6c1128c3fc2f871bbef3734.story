The death toll from this month's Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines has spiked to 5,235, a national agency reported early Saturday.

That figure -- posted at 6 a.m. (5 p.m. ET Friday) on the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council's website -- marks a significant increase from counts earlier in the week. On Thursday, for instance, the toll stood at slightly more than 4,000.

The same agency also reported that 23,501 were injured due to the epic storm, with 1,613 reported missing. The missing amount is 31 higher than a day earlier.

The monster typhoon left behind a catastrophic scene after it made landfall on six Philippine islands on November 8, leaving many without immediate access to food and medical care.

It flattened some communities and displaced about 3 million people.
