Kampala, Uganda (CNN)Gunmen on a motorcycle have shot and killed Uganda's lead prosecutor in the 2010 bombings that killed 76 people who were watching the World Cup finals.

Joan Kagezi stopped at a roadside produce stand in a Kampala suburb Monday evening to buy some fruit when her assailants approached, according to police.

"Criminals riding on a motorcycle ... stopped next to the parked car she was driving and shot her twice in the neck and shoulder through the window on the driver's side," Kale Kayihura, the inspector general of police, said Tuesday.  Kagezi was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

Kagezi was the lead prosecutor in the case of 13 terror suspects now before the High Court in Kampala. The blasts erupted in an Ethiopian restaurant and a rugby center while crowds watched the World Cup finals on TV. Spain defeated the Netherlands 1-0 in the 2010 championship hosted by South Africa.

Kagezi also was in charge of the nation's International Crime Division.

Kayihura called her death a big loss for the country and promised to hunt for her killers.

"The murder of Joan Kagezi should only serve to increase our resolve to hunt down and bring to justice all those elements bent on disturbing the security and development of our country," Kayihura said.
