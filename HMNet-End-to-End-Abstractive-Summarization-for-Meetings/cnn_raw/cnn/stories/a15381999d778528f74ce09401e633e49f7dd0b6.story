Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. was sentenced to serve three months in jail and fined $2,500 Wednesday in connection with a domestic violence incident, according to court officials and CNN affiliate reports.

Mayweather pleaded guilty to a charge of battery and two counts of harassment, prosecutors said.

He was arrested in September 2010, police said, after he punched the mother of his children at his home, according to CNN affiliate KVVU. According to an arrest report, Mayweather threatened Josie Harris, saying, "I'm going to kill you and the man you are messing around with," the station said.

Mayweather was sentenced to six months in jail on the misdemeanor charges, but 90 days will be suspended if he serves 90 days, said Mary Ann Price, spokeswoman for Clark County, Nevada, courts.  He also must perform 100 hours of community service and attend long-term domestic violence counseling, she said.

He must report to jail January 6, Price said.

Mayweather's publicists declined comment on the matter.

Felony charges of coercion, robbery and grand larceny were dismissed as part of a plea agreement, CNN affiliate KNSV reported.
