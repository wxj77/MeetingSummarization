Washington (CNN) -- House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is tapping a fresh face -- 42-year-old Latino Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico -- to replace Rep. Steve Israel of New York at the helm of the party's campaign efforts.

Israel chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 2012 and 2014 elections but had said in the wake of this year's Republican victories that he wouldn't seek a third term in that role.

Lujan, a former state utility regulator who was first elected to Congress in 2008, is set to start his fourth term representing a congressional district that includes Santa Fe.

Pelosi tweeted the news of Lujan's selection Monday.

Lujan is one of the Democratic caucuses younger members, a group that has faced pressure to bring newer members to the leadership table. Lujan will face a tall task: After a drubbing in the 2014 midterms, Democrats have just 186 House seats to the GOP's 244, with five races still undecided.
