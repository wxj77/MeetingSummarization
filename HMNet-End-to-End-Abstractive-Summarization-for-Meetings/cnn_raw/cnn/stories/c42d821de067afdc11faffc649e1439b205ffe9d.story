(CNN)If you've ever hankered after a horse haven, a slice has just come on the market -- at a price of $22.9 million.

Former FedEx CEO Ted Weise is selling his 50-acre equestrian estate in Florida, which includes scenic horse riding trails and a riding arena.

Oh, and when you've dusted yourself down after a tough day in the saddle there are 10 full baths and three partial baths to help you scrub up, before you start exploring the 1,000-bottle wine cellar to help you quench your thirst.

This is an equestrian lover's dream, boasting fully equipped eight-stall stables, a riding and jumping arena, eight turnout paddocks, and riding trails that wind through cypress and pine trees -- not to mention a 20,000-acre nature reserve surrounding the grounds.

"This is one of the most fantastic equestrian properties in all of South Florida," says Sotheby's International Realty which is selling the property.

Located in the gated community of Ranch Colony in Jupiter, Florida, the property, described by Sotheby's as "Spanish/Mediterranean," also includes a heated saltwater pool, a chef's kitchen and an observation lounge offering panoramic views of the ranch.

If you're worried about Florida's occasional blowy weather rest easy.

"All three structures, the main house, guest house, and barn were built to exceed Miami/Dade hurricane specifications with impact glass and reinforced rebar concrete roofs, walls, and floors, and multiple generators," said Sotheby's.

The 70-year-old Weise and his wife Sharon bought the land site for $2.7m in 2004 but are now looking to downsize to a "miniature version" of the property, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Other celebrities that have owned equestrian estates include musician Bruce Springsteen, whose daughter is an avid equestrian competitor and actor Tommy Lee Jones who once owned a 52-acre polo ranch.
