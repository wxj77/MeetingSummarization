(CNN) -- Switzerland's Lara Gut made history on Saturday when she became the youngest-ever winner of a women's World Cup race when claiming victory in the super-G at St Moritz.

Gut holds the Swiss flag aloft after becoming the youngest skier to win a women's World Cup race.

Cheered on by the local supporters, the 17-year-old finished ahead of compatriot Fabienne Suter with Italy's Nadia Fanchini -- the winner of  the opening super-G in Lake Louise, Canada, finishing third.

Gut gave a clear indication of her immense talent on Friday when finishing fifth in the super-combined and she produced a near flawless run of 57.38 seconds to finish well clear of her rivals.

Suter, who finished third on Friday, moved up one place on the podium with a time 00.63 secs behind Gut.

World Cup leader Lindsay Vonn failed to finish on a piste that had been considerably shortened to deal with poor visibility caused by falling snow.

American Vonn, the defending overall champion, was one of many racers caught out by a bump in a fast section after a sharp right-hand turn.

Vonn said Gut's maiden win was not a surprise. "She has been skiing well all season so far," said the 24-year-old. "She has got a lot to learn still, but on a day like today, going first, it was a perfect chance for her. She definitely executed and seized the opportunity."

Gut added: "I was really nervous as I wasn't used to being the leader, but gradually I began to realise that in fact I had skied really well especially when I saw that Nadia  and Fabienne were behind me."
