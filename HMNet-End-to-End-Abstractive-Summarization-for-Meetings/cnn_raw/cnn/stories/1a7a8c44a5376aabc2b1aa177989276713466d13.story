Halfway between the Pyramids of Giza and the modern city of Cairo lies an $800 million compound that will soon be home to 100,000 ancient artifacts spanning more than 7,000 years of history.

The Grand Egyptian Museum will become the world's largest archeological institution when it opens in the fall, and includes a conference center, training center and several archeology workshops.

Its biggest draw card will no doubt be the display of more than 3,500 artifacts belonging to the famous King Tutankhamen.
