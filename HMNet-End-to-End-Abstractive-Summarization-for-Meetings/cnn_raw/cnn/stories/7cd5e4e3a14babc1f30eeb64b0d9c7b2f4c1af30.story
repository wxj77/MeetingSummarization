(CNN) -- Spain international Juan Mata is poised to Join English club Chelsea after they agreed a deal for the player with Valencia.

The 23-year-old is due in London to discuss personal terms and have a medical at the Premier League runners up this week.

Chelsea's London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham had been credited with an interest in the playmaker but he is set for a move to Stamford Bridge.

Mata began his career at Real Oviedo before joining Spanish giants Real Madrid as a 15-year-old.

He moved to Valencia in 2007 and quickly established himself as an important first team player, scoring in his team's Copa Del Rey victory over Getafe.

The following season he missed only one league game for Valencia and forced his way into the national team.

He was part of the Spain squad that lifted the 2010 World Cup but appeared only once as a substitute, in place of another of Chelsea's Spanish players, Fernando Torres.

Meanwhile, German Bundesliga club Wolfsburg have signed Liverpool's Greek defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos and Hrvoje Cale from Turkish outfit Trabzonspor.

Kyrgiakos is familiar with German football after a two-year spell with Eintracht Frankfurt between 2006 and 2008.

Cale, who is 26-years-old, has signed a deal until the end of the 2014 season.
