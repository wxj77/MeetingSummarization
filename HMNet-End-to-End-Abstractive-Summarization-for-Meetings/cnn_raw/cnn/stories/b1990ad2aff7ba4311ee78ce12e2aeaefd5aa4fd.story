(CNN Student News) -- October 15, 2013

With the debt ceiling deadline days away, leaders in Washington say they're optimistic about reaching a deal. We also discuss an infectious bacterium that appeared in an NFL locker room, and we explain the Muslim ritual of Hajj. Plus, we make a Career Connection with an opera singer, and a high school elects a king and queen that students say embody the spirit of homecoming.
