(CNN) -- Tunisia and co-hosts Gabon secured dramatic last-gasp victories to reach the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations Friday.

Tunisia needed a final minute goal from Issam Jemaa to beat Niger 2-1 while Gabon came from behind to beat Morocco 3-2 with their winner in the eighth minute of added time.

It left them tied on six points and assured of a place in the last eight, while Morocco and debutants Niger are going home and are pointless with a match to play in Group C.

The first game in Libreville saw Niger put up a brave challenge and Tunisia coach Sami Trabelsi was relieved by his team's victory.

"We knew Niger would be well organized and rigorous on the counter attack. The spirit of my team was there for all to see. Thank God we were able to win, thank God," he told AFP.

Tunisia were ahead after only three minutes when Youssef Msakni beat several defenders before shooting home.

But within five minutes Niger were level as William Tonji Ngounou scored their first ever goal in the Africa Cup of Nations finals.

Niger had the better chances to win the match, but a point was cruelly snatched from them by Jemaa's late strike.

That was forerunner for the drama of the second match of the evening at the Stade l'Amitie stadium and an incredible finish which sent the home fans into wild celebrations.

Gabon looked set for a 2-1 victory as second half goals from Daniel Cousin and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had put them in control after Houssine Kharja's first half opener for Morocco.

But in the first minute of added time Morocco won a penalty and Kharja equalized with his second of the match.

Then up cropped Bruno Mbanangoyes to curl home a free kick in the eighth minute of stoppage time of a remarkable encounter.
