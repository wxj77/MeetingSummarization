It was a welcome success for the company, following the disappointing performance of DreamWorks Animation's "Rise of the Guardians" in late 2012.

"The Croods," about a family of cavemen on the dangerous but adventurous search for a new home, featured the voice talent of Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Nicolas Cage, and Catherine Keener.
