(EW.com) -- Just two weeks after plans were announced for a "Breaking Bad" spinoff, series creator Vince Gilligan has inked a deal to create another TV show.

He will join forces with "House" creator David Shore on the police drama "Battle Creek," which will debut during the 2014-2015 season on CBS.

The series centers on two detectives with thoroughly different world views, one cynical and one naive, who team up to "clean up the semi-mean streets" of Battle Creek, Michigan. The project is not exactly new: Gilligan originally penned a script for "Battle Creek" in 2002 for CBS, but the network never greenlighted it.

Gilligan and Shore are writing the updated version of the pilot, and both are serving as executive producers along with Mark Johnson ("Breaking Bad"). Shore will also act as the "Battle Creek" showrunner.

Sony, the studio that also produces "Breaking Bad," has secured a 13-episode commitment from the network before a pilot has even been shot.

AMC's "Breaking Bad," which won the Outstanding Drama Emmy three days ago, wraps up its five-season run on Sunday.

Gilligan is also teaming up with "Breaking Bad" co-executive producer Peter Gould for "Better Call Saul," the spinoff prequel that's built around shady lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk).
