(CNN) -- When he wasn't laughing, Joe Biden sounded like a belligerent old man.

Paul Ryan sipped from a cup and looked like a beleaguered altar boy.

Fair or not, those were just two characterizations of Thursday's vice presidential debate on Twitter, where a Greek chorus of jokesters kept up a witty commentary throughout the 90-minute throwdown. As with any live TV event in the social media age, the people of Twitter let no gaffe or verbal tic go unnoticed.

Here are 25 of our favorites:
