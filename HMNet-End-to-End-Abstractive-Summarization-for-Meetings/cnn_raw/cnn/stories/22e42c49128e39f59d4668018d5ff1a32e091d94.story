(CNN) -- Police in California arrested Wednesday a woman they said is suspected of killing a nursing student who was last seen in a hospital parking garage more than three months ago.

Giselle Esteban, 27, was arrested in Union City, California, Wednesday, Lt. Roger Keener of the Hayward Police Department told reporters.

Evidence -- including blood stains, security camera footage, cell phone records and DNA found on a shoe -- led to Esteban's arrest "for the murder of Michelle Le," Keener said. Esteban was arraigned on Wednesday afternoon and was listed as an inmate in an Alameda County jail without bail.

Le, a 26-year-old nursing student, disappeared on May 27 after telling classmates at a hospital in Hawyard, California, that she was going to get something from her car, Keener said. She never returned and the abandoned vehicle was later found about a half-mile away.

Investigators searched Esteban's house shortly after Le disappeared. As part of that search, Keener said, they found Le's DNA on one of Esteban's shoes.

Police have classified the case as a homicide, but her family has held out hope for her safe return, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Le's family has offered a $100,000 reward for her return or for information on her whereabouts.

"At this point she is still missing and we will fight to bring her home every day until we have her with our family again," cousin Krystine Dinh told reporters after police announced Esteban's arrest Wednesday.

Le's 23-year-old brother, Michael, told reporters that Thursday will be his birthday -- a day his sister would always call him.

"I just want to hear her voice so badly, and the only thing I'm going to be wishing for is for her to come back home," he said.

Keener pledged that police would continue their search.

"We will not consider this investigation to be complete until Michelle is found," he said.
