(CNN) -- Many "Twilight" fans are savoring their last bites of the vampire fantasy films they have adored for four years.

The "Twi-hards" are all abuzz about this weekend's release of "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2." Many will be mourning the end of this series and wondering what they should follow next. Of course, there will be others who don't get what the fuss is about.

We asked readers to tell us what they think of life after "Twilight" using the hashtag #WhenTwilightEnds, and we scooped up many responses via social media. Read below to see the different "teams" that developed, in the spirit of "Team Edward" (vampire) and "Team Jacob" (werewolf).
