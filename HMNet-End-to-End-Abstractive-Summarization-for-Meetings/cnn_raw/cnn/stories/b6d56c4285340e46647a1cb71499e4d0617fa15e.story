(CNN)Sia's new video, "Elastic Heart," features 28-year-old actor Shia LaBeouf and 12-year-old "Dance Moms" star Maddie Ziegler, both dressed in dirty, flesh-colored leotards, playfully approaching, touching and running from one another in a zoo-like cage.

Internet, start your outrage.

"the video definitely has got this weird pedophile vibe," wrote Irrational Action on YouTube.

"this video did make me uncomfortable at PARTS ... maybe its because maddie is like 12 and shia is almost thirty and i watch dance moms too so I really see her for her age," wrote YouTube commenter Esther Jonson.

"The new sia video is disgusting ! Like the song made a bit of sense then the video was like abacajavalaoavwpabsh @maddieziegler that's not u," added Suza aka suz on Twitter.

Elle magazine described it as "creepy naked."

Though the video is probably better viewed as interpretative dance -- as other commenters observed, it may be about Sia's relationship with her father -- the singer apologized if it was misconstrued.

"I apologize to those who feel triggered by #ElasticHeart My intention was to create some emotional content, not to upset anybody," she tweeted.

Others got her point.

"Wish people would shut up about the supposed 'peaodophilia' in @Sia new video! It's beautiful! Dont be scared of Art," tweeted Helen Anderson.

The attention hasn't hurt. On YouTube, "Elastic Heart" has received 4.3 million views in the one day since it was posted.
