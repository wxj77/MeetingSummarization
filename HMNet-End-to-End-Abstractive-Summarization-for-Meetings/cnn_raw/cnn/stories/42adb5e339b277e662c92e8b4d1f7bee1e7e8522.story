Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba announced a Cabinet reshuffle Friday, sacking the construction minister for undisclosed "errors" and removing the communications minister in order to give him broader oversight over various ministries.

According to an official communique published in state media, Construction Minister Fidel Figueroa de la Paz was removed "for mistakes made in his job." It did not provide more details.

Ramiro Valdes, a historic leader of the Revolution and vice president of the Council of Ministers, was removed from his post as communications minister.

But according to the statement, he was "freed up" in order to give his attention not only the Communications Ministry but also the Construction and Basic Industry Ministries.

Valdes, 78, fought along side Fidel and Raul Castro from the beginning of the revolutionary movement in 1953 and is considered close to the current president.

General Medardo Diaz Toledo will be the new communications minister and Rene Mesa Villafana will assume the head of the Construction Ministry.

President Raul Castro has replaced a number of ministers since officially being elected in 2008.

He has also announced sweeping changes to the Soviet-style economic model.

More than a million state jobs are slated to disappear, while the government has given the green light for expansion of the private sector.
