(CNN) -- Arthur was downgraded from a hurricane to a post-tropical storm on Saturday, as its sustained winds dropped to 85 mph, according to CNN meteorologists.

Tropical storm warnings previously issued for Nantucket and Cape Cod have been discontinued.

The first named storm of this hurricane season caused street flooding and knocked out power along the North Carolina coast. The area appears to have been spared from large-scale damage.

The center of Arthur is forecast to pass over or near western Nova Scotia on Saturday while also bringing heavy rain to New England, CNN meteorologists said.

The coast of Maine can expect 40 mph winds as Arthur passes.

The hurricane center warns that potentially deadly rip currents can still form at beaches from the mid-Atlantic northward, even though Arthur may be far away.
