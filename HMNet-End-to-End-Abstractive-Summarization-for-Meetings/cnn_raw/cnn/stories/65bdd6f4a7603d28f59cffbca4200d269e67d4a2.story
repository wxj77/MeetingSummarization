Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- At least four people were killed and about 15 wounded when a car bomb exploded Saturday near Lebanon's border with Syria, an official said.

The incident occurred at about 6 p.m. (11 a.m. ET) near a fuel station at the entrance to the Lebanese town of Hermel, Lebanon's National News Agency reported.

Interior Minister Marwan Charbel told Al-Manar TV that the blast occurred when a suicide bomber driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee detonated the explosives.

Charbel called the country's security situation "unstable and changing for the worse with every passing day."

Video from the scene showed people running in front of fires blazing in the darkness.

Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati denounced the explosion. "Once again, the hands of treason target a Lebanese region and claim the lives of innocent citizens," said Mikati, imploring all sides to unite for the sake of the country and its people, NNA reported.

The U.S. Embassy in Beirut condemned the bombing. "We regret that the people of Hermel have once again been subjected to an act of reprehensible terrorism. We urge all parties to exercise restraint and refrain from contributing to the cycle of violence."
