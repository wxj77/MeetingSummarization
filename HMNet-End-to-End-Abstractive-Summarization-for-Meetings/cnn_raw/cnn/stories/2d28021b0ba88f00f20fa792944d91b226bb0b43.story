Mix up moles south of the border

Learn to tell your chiles from your chapulines (toasted grasshoppers) at Seasons of My Heart, a cooking school in the Oaxacan countryside of southern Mexico that kicks off with some serious market research. Guided by Mexican food maven Susana Trilling, sample and buy local delicacies, then head back to the chopping blocks and stoves of Trilling's spacious blue-tiled kitchen to create complex moles and picante bisques.

With 80 horses, daily clinics and morning and afternoon rides, greenhorns and seasoned equestrians can develop their skills in the arena and on trails threading through the aspen forests.

Salmon River, California

Master whitewater paddling

Get command of whitewater paddling basics at Otter Bar Lodge Kayak School, a wilderness hideaway on Northern California's Salmon River, about 112 miles northeast of Eureka. You'll start by practicing stroke technique, wet exits and rolling in the lodge's flat-water pond before graduating to day trips on the warm class I-II water of the Salmon and Klamath Rivers. Don't sweat it if you can't master a roll on the first day: Otter Bar's instructors shadow your every paddle stroke, and if you go over, they're more than happy to right your boat (in kayak-speak, the "hand of God").

Play hooky: The wood-fired sauna and on-call massage therapist can work out your paddling kinks.

Info: April-September; $2,190 per week, including meals, lodging and gear; 530/462-4772. --Katie Arnold

What better place to learn to surf than at a lodge set in a coastal rain forest with views of bears, eagles and whales?

Denali National Park, Alaska

Unravel celestial mysteries

To understand what makes the Northern Lights so spectacular, take a crash course in astrophysics at Camp Denali, an 18-cabin retreat inside Alaska's Denali National Park and Preserve. During three- and four-night programs, Neal Brown, space expert and director of the Alaska Space Grant Program, will explain the magnetic forces that create the aurora borealis and other atmospheric phenomena. By day, you can grill Brown with questions you might have; at night, he'll call your cabin if he spots the elusive lights above.
