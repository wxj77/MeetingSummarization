Afghanistan, Philippines, low-earth orbit: These are a few of the places we visit on CNN Student News this Monday. Go inside a government command center whose job is to prevent cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure. Understand what makes diet sodas sweet, and hear why some health officials are concerned about them. And see an owl as you've never seen it before!
