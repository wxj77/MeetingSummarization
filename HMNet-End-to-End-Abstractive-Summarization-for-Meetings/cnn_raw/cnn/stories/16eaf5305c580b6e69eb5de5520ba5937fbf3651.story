(CNN) -- Mainz made it seven wins out of seven in the Bundesliga on Saturday as they overcame 10-man Hoffenheim 4-2 at the Stadion am Bruchweg.

The win equals the record -- held by Kaisterslautern and Bayern Munich -- for most wins at the start of a Bundesliga season.

Tunisia striker Sami Allagui opened the scoring for Mainz after just two minutes.

Hoffenheim hit back before half time with a strike from Demba Ba, but Hungarian striker Adam Szalai restored the home side's lead two minutes into the second half.

Midfielder Lewis Holtby added a third before 19-year-old striker Andre Schuerrle added a fourth from the penalty spot after Josip Simunic was shown a red card for bringing down Holtby in the 73rd minute.

Mainz, who beat Bayern Munich 2-1 last week, face Hamburg in their next Bundesliga fixture and will be hoping to create Bundesliga history by claiming their eighth straight win.

But coach Thomas Tuchel says he's not interested in records.

"During the game, I didn't even think about records, for me it is not even an issue," Tuchel said, AFP reported.

Ex-England boss Steve McClaren was denied a fourth straight win as Wolfsburg drew 1-1 with Moenchengladbach.

Danish midfielder Thomas Kahlenberg gave Wolfsburg the lead after 27 minutes but Thorben Marx tied the scores with a 65th minute strike.

Freiburg moved up to fourth place in the table after a 3-2 home win over Cologne, while Hamburg are now seventh after they came from behind to beat Kaiserslautern 2-1.

Schalke went down to their fifth defeat of the season losing 2-1 to Nuremberg, leaving last year's runners-up languishing in second to last place in the table.

Sunday's fixtures see Bayern Munich travel to second-placed Dortmund, bottom-placed Stuttgart host Frankfurt and fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen take on Werder Bremen.
