(CNN) -- Miley Cyrus' Christmas gift to fans? More of the same.

The controversial singer's video for her song "Adore You" leaked online Christmas Day and it's filled with Miley, well, being Miley. Cyrus rolls around filming herself on under a sheet on a bed, clad in a sheer bra and panties and doing plenty of ... self-exploration. She also steams things up in a bathtub.

The video was originally scheduled to be released on December 26, but popped up a day earlier to the singer's apparent chagrin.

"We all know Smilers would break another record if it wasn't for the f**k face who leaked my video. Alllllll good! Keep smiling," Cyrus tweeted on Wednesday.

Fans had to be quick to catch a look on Wednesday, however, as the video disappeared from YouTube almost as quickly as it had appeared. It was reposted on Thursday, the original release date.

The song is the third single off of her hit album, "Bangerz" and she had earlier released teasers to fans to get them excited for the new video. "Were so close to â€ª#AdoreYouâ€¬ 3 daysssss until the world premier on vevo... I can't waiiiiitt annnny longerrrr!" she said on Twitter Monday.

It remains to be seen if this new video will inspire as many parodies as its predecessor, "Wrecking Ball" which featured Cyrus conducting various activities including swinging nude on a wrecking ball and licking a sledgehammer.
