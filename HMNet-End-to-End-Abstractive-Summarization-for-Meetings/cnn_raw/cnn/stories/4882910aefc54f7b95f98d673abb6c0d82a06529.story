(CNN) -- Business partners tend to limit their disagreements to the boardroom. With the happiness of their shareholders in mind, it doesn't pay to air dirty laundry in public.

So when two of the world's foremost tycoons began venting anger at each other publicly, it was bound to attract attention.

British financier Nat Rothschild joined forces with Indonesia's Bakrie family in 2010 with the ambitious plan to create a blue chip UK-listed mining company.

But with coal prices falling and allegations of financial irregularities, the company had lost half its value by 2012. By the time talks started about a possible split, its shares had lost 80% of their value, public reports show.

In December, shareholders voted for separation and on Tuesday, the final details were agreed.

So while the celebity-focused world watched as Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin announced their "conscious uncoupling," business circles were preoccupied by a very different -- and very public -- "divorce."

The two tycoons took to Twitter to vent their feelings about the failed partnership, and what followed was a quite spectacular exchange of words.
