(CNN) -- The powerful storm system behind the twister that ravaged Moore, Oklahoma, set its sights on the Great Lakes and Tennessee Valley on Wednesday, forecasters said.

"Primary threats will be damaging winds and large hail," according to the National Weather Service. "Isolated tornadoes will also be possible."

Severe weather watches continued into the early hours of the day for portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi.

The threat of a few strong tornadoes, large hail and thunderstorm wind gusts remained in northeastern Texas, southwestern Arkansas, extreme southeastern Oklahoma and northwestern Louisiana, CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris said. A strong line of storms was also present across much of Mississippi.

"The threat for strong tornadoes will rapidly diminish in these areas ... with the main threat becoming damaging straight line winds during the overnight hours," Morris said. "Isolated tornadoes will still be possible."

Rainstorms pushed through the Dallas area on Tuesday afternoon. A ground stop at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport was later lifted.

Why Moore has been hit more than once

Storms weren't restricted to the Great Plains and Midwest.

The National Weather Service said weather spotters on Tuesday afternoon reported a possible tornado near Copake, New York, near the Massachusetts border.
