(CNN) -- The NCAA says it has contacted the FBI after point-shaving allegations were lodged against Auburn University's men's basketball program.

"We are very concerned by the point-shaving allegations involving Auburn University men's basketball program and have been in contact with the school and the FBI since the issue arose in February," the NCAA said this week in a statement.

"The NCAA takes any allegation of point shaving very seriously because sports wagering threatens two of our core principles -- the well-being of student-athletes and the very integrity of intercollegiate sport."

Auburn also says it has contacted the FBI.

"Auburn officials were made aware of a rumor regarding an allegation two weeks ago and immediately reported it to the FBI, the NCAA and the (Southeastern Conference). Because of the nature of the allegation, Auburn is not in a position to make any further comment on the situation," said Cassie Arner, a university spokeswoman.

The FBI said it could not comment on the issue.

Point-shaving schemes usually involve a player taking payments from a gambler to ensure a team does not cover a published point spread.

Yahoo Sports, ESPN and other sports outlets have reported on the issue, saying the investigation is focused on one Auburn basketball player who was recently suspended.

CNN's John Branch, Joe Sutton and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.
