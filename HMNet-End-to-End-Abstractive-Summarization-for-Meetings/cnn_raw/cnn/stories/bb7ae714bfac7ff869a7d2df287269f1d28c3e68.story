"The stain of racism and sexism is not just for people of color and women," Davis said. "It's all of our burden, all of us."

Davis' best actress win seemed to throw the Oscar competition into a frenzy, since she beat Meryl Streep and Michelle Williams, actresses who won Golden Globes two weeks ago.

Streep was nominated for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in "Iron Lady," and MIchelle Williams, was nominated for playing movie legend Marilyn Monroe in "My Week With Marilyn."

Jean Dujardin won the SAG best actor in a film award for his lead role in "The Artist," a black-and-white, silent film.

The win gives Dujardin an apparent edge against George Clooney and the three other nominees in next month's Oscar best actor competition.

Spencer's supporting actress SAG award makes her a clear frontrunner for the supporting actress Oscar, considering she also won the Golden Globe.

"These women represent our mothers and grandmothers," Spencer said, referring to the maids portrayed in "The Help." "By honoring me, you're honoring them."

Christopher Plummer, 82, also earned frontrunner status for in the Academy Award best supporting actor competition by winning the SAG honor Sunday night for his role in "The Beginners."

"I just cannot tell you how much fun I've had being a member of the world's second oldest profession," Plummer said as he accepted his SAG trophy.

The SAG actor trophies go to both television and film actors, and the winners are chosen by their acting peers.

SAG President Ken Howard also used the event to announce the actor union's board approved a proposal to merge with AFTRA, another acting union, pending approval of their memberships.

Jessica Lange won the SAG trophy for best actress in a TV drama series for her work in the FX's "American Horror Story." It is her first SAG honor.
