(Mashable)  -- In an update to one of the more iconic "year-end" magazine editions, People has launched a "Sexiest Man Alive on Facebook" campaign to complement its "Sexiest Man Alive" issue, which hits newsstands later this month.

For the campaign, People has chosen five celebs that aren't just "sexy" (as defined by the editors, we presume), but also have a big presence in social media.

Notably, the Old Spice guy is on the list, as well as Vin Diesel (who we've long noted is disproportionately popular on Facebook) and NFL social media super user Chad Ochocinco.

Enrique Iglesias and "Jersey Shore's" Pauly D round out the five celebrities that People's Facebook fans can vote for through November 10.

The winner will be revealed in the "Sexiest Man Alive" issue -- the 25th edition of the feature.

While hardly the most innovative application, we imagine it will be a win for People -- which also recently launched its iPad app -- as its social media obsessed nominees encourage their fans to vote.

Who do you think should take the title? Let us know in the comments.
