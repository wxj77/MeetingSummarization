(CNN) -- A Florida man is accused of strangling a family puppy, chopping it into pieces and cooking its ribs on the stove, Tampa police said.

Thomas Elliot Huggins, 25, was arrested Thursday after a family member called police.

"When officers arrived, they found the dog's ribs cooked in a pot on the stove," Tampa police said. "The dog's head was in the garbage."

Huggins had strangled the 5- to 6-month-old puppy and chopped it into quarters, storing pieces in the freezer for future meals, authorities said.

He was arrested on suspicion of animal cruelty. Animal control officials took the remains of the puppy.
