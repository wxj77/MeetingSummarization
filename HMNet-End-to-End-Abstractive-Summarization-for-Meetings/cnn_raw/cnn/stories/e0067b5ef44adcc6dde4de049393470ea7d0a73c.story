(CNN) -- Andy Murray has won his first match after splitting with coach Ivan Lendl, beating Australia's Matthew Ebden in the second round of the Miami Masters in Florida.

The Scot, who is defending the title he won 12 months ago, started life after Lendl nervously, losing the opening set before rallying in the second and third to eventually beat the world No. 67 3-6 6-0 6-1.

Murray announced an amicable parting of ways with Lendl on Wednesday bringing the curtain down on a highly fruitful two-year partnership.

Lendl, who is leaving to spend time on other projects, is credited with helping turn Murray into a grand slam champion, overseeing victories at the U.S. Open in 2012 and an historic win at Wimbledon last year.

The 26-year-old paid tribute to his former coach after victory late on Friday.

"It was very different without him, it's been a hard few days," Murray told Sky Sports.

"He's been a big part of my career and to not have him around is going to be tough, but I just need to get on with it now and try to get back to playing my best tennis."

Next up in round three is Spain's Feliciano Lopez who Murray has never lost to in eight previous meetings.

Earlier on Friday, Roger Federer came through comfortably against Ivo Karlovic 6-4 7-6 (7/4).

The Swiss, who was defeated by Novak Djokovic in the final of BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells last weekend, continued his recent good run of form against the big-serving Croat.

"So, (his serve) can be quite difficult or overwhelming. But if you're in the right mindset mentally, it can also be enjoyable. That's how I approach the match, anyway," Federer said, ATPTour.com reported.

Federer, a winner in Miami in 2005 and 2006, will face Thiemo de Bakker next after the Dutch qualifier ranked 162 in the world upset world No. 29 Fernando Verdasco in three sets 7-6 (7/4) 6-7 (3/7) 6-2.

Djokovic is also safely through to the third round after beating France's Jeremy Chardy 6-4 6-3, as is David Ferrer who saw off Georgia's Teymuraz Gabashvili 6-4 6-0.

In the women's draw, Venus Williams recorded a straight sets (6-3 6-3) win over Slovakia's Anna Schmiedlova to set up a meeting with Casey Dellacqua of Australia.

Former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic suffered a shock defeat to Varvara Lepchenko of Uzbekistan -- the Serb losing in three sets 6-3 2-6 7-6 (7/2) -- but Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska is safely through to the next round after dispatching Switzerland's Romina Oprandi 6-0 6-4.

China's Li Na will face America's Madison Keys in the third round.

The Australian Open champion had a walkover after her second round opponent Alisa Kleybanova pulled out with a virus while Keys upset world No. 31 Daniela Hantuchova with a 6-3 6-2 victory.
