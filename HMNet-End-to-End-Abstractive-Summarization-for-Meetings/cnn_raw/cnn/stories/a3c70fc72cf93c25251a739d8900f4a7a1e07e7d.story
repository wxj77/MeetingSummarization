(EW.com) -- If trends come in cycles, maybe it's time to bring Miranda Priestly, Andrea Sachs, and the "clackers" at Runway magazine out of the fashion closet.

EW has learned exclusively that author Lauren Weisberger is working on "Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns," a sequel to her debut novel "The Devil Wears Prada." Simon & Schuster will be publishing the follow-up in April 2013 -- 10 years after the release of the original.

In 2003, "The Devil Wears Prada" reached the top of the best-seller lists and went on to inspire the hit 2006 film starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. The novel -- a roman Ã  clef partly based on Weisberger's own experience as second assistant to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour -- told the story of Andrea "Andy" Sachs, an aspiring journalist dealing with the increasingly unreasonable demands of her fashion editrix boss Miranda Priestly.

"Revenge Wears Prada" picks up eight years after Andy parted ways with Miranda on bad terms. Andy is now editing The Plunge, the hottest bridal magazine around, alongside Emily, her one-time Runway nemesis turned current BFF. While Andy is planning her own wedding to Max, a handsome media scion, she remains haunted by her impeccably heeled former boss -- and the magazine world being as small as it is, it's only a matter of time before she hears the dreaded syllables "Ahn-dre-ah!" again.

Weisberger has written three novels since "The Devil Wears Prada," but this is her first return to the cutthroat world of Runway magazine. Are you excited for Miranda Priestly's wrath? Do you dare dream of a Streep-Hathaway-Blunt-Tucci reunion?
