(CNN)They are two of the continent's acknowledged football powerhouses and later Sunday either Ivory Coast or Ghana will end a long and frustrating wait to be crowned Africa Cup of Nations champions.

Ghana last lifted the trophy 33 years ago and was beaten in the 1992 final by Ivory Coast, the last time The Elephants claimed the prestigious crown.

The meeting in Bata will bring down the curtain on a tournament -- hosted at the last minute by Equatorial Guinea after Morocco declined because of Ebola fears -- which has seen some fine football but also been blighted by crowd trouble inside and outside the stadiums.

Ghana's 3-0 semifinal win over the hosts saw the worst scenes, with a helicopter deployed to disperse fans at the Estadio de Malabo and the game held up for several minutes.

Overshadowed by the violent scenes was a solid team performance by the Black Stars, with Andre Ayew, the son of the legendary Abedi 'Pele' Ayew, rounding off the scoring with his third goal of the competition.

Ivory Coast, with a host of talented players such as Manchester City's Yaya Toure and the club's new signing Wilfried Bony, has come on strong after needing to beat Cameroon to reach the knockout stages.

The Ivorians will start marginal favorites to win the Africa Cup of Nations for the second time.

Ghana is a four-time winner and has five wins in nine matches with Ivory Coast at the finals, losing three with the other drawn.
