(CNN) -- Defending champions Borussia Dortmund were held 4-4 in a frantic finish to their home match against VfB Stuttgart Friday.

The Bundesliga leaders were denied a precious three points when visiting striker Christian Gentner scored the final equalizer in added time.

It completed a topsy-turvy final last 15 minutes as the lead changed hands three times before the sides fittingly shared the points.

But second placed Bayern Munich can now halve Dortmund's six-point lead with victory against Nuremberg Saturday.

The top two are heading for a final showdown on Dortmund's home ground at Signal Iduna Park on April 11 which could well decide the destination of the German title.

Dortmund, like Bayern on a superb run, looked to be cruising to a routine home win when their Japanese star Shinji Kagawa put them ahead with his fourth goal in three league games on 33 minutes.

And when Jakub Blaszczykowski stretched their lead four minutes after the break from a pass by defender Mats Hummels it looked all over a victory for the men in yellow.

But three goals in eight minutes by Stuttgart turned the game on its head.

Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic cut the deficit with a 71st minute strike before Julian Schieber scored a quickfire double, the second a superb individual effort, to put the visitors 3-2 ahead.

Dortmund drew level when defender Hummels cropped up to beat Stuttgart goalkeeper Sven Ulreich on 82 minutes and looked set to have settled the match when Croatia midfielder Ivan Perisic scored after coming off the substitute's bench.

But deep into injury time and Gentner stunned the home fans with a dramatic late strike, which has opened the door for Bavarian giants Bayern.

"To concede the equalizer in the last few seconds was a bitter way to finish the game, Hummels told German television after the match.
