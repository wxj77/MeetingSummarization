Berlin (CNN) -- Police arrested three Chinese nationals after authorities uncovered about 100 snakes, 70 tortoises and 20 neon-colored frogs in their hotel room in western Germany, according to a police spokesman.

The discovery was made Friday after a hotel employee found a snake on a stairway and alerted authorities, said Cologne police spokesman Stefan Kirchner.

The guests were arrested on suspicion of illegally importing the animals, he said.

"After paying several thousand euro for deposit, they were released on Friday evening," added Kirchner.

The creatures have since been relocated to Cologne city zoo.
