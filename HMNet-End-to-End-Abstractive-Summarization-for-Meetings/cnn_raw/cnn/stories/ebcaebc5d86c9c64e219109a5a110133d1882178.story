(CNN) -- A magnitude 8.2 earthquake struck the Russian Far East on Friday, the U.S. Geologicial Survey reported.

The epicenter for the extremely powerful quake was located in the Sea of Okhotsk, just to the west of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and about 600 kilometers (nearly 375 miles) underground.

The quake was felt for five minutes in the region, Russia's Ria Novosti news agency reported. Many people ran into the streets as the temblor shook.

No tsunami warnings were issued in the quake's immediate aftermath.

The region is located along the Pacific "ring of fire," an area of high seismic and volcanic activity stretching from New Zealand in the South Pacific up through Japan, across to Alaska and down the west coasts of North and South America.
