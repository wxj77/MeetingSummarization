Abbottabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- News outlets in Pakistan have made public the name of an American they identified as the CIA station chief, but a senior Pakistani intelligence official said Monday the person named is not the station chief.

Referring to a name cited in the Pakistani newspaper The Nation, the intelligence official said, "If we were going to release the name, we would release the right one." The official said he did not know where the name came from.

A U.S. official said there is "no current plan to bring home the current chief of station" in Pakistan.

The remarks came amid reports suggesting Pakistani officials may have leaked the name of a CIA official in the country.

Tensions between the United States and Pakistan have been growing since U.S. forces found and killed Osama bin Laden in the city of Abbottabad a week ago. U.S. officials have been publicly questioning whether Pakistan did all it could to track down the world's most wanted terrorist.
