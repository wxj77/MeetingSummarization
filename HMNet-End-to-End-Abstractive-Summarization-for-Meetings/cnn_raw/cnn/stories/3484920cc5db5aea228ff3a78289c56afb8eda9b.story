(CNN) -- Portugal will face Bosnia and Herzegovina for a place in Euro 2012 after the pair were drawn together in the playoffs to reach the finals in Poland and Ukraine next year.

Portugal, coached by former international midfielder Paulo Bento, qualifed for the 2010 World Cup finals courtesy of a playoff success against Safet Susic's Bosnia Herzegovina, and the Euro 2004 hosts and finalists will have to repeat the feat over two legs.

Portugal will have home advantage for the second leg on November 15, with the first leg set to take place on November 11 or 12.

Three other ties were drawn at the ceremony in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, with Croatia set to face Turkey in a repeat of the Euro 2008 quarterfinal.

Turkey, now coached by Dutchman Guus Hiddink, claimed a penalty shootout victory when the two sides met in Vienna four years ago before losing to Germany in the semifinals.

Estonia will have to overcome Giovanni Trapattoni's Republic of Ireland if they are to qualify for their first major soccer championship.

Ireland will be making their sixth appearance in a major tournament playoff, having missed out on last year's World Cup when a controversial William Gallas goal, after an apparent handball from Thierry Henry, condemned them to defeat against France.

The final playoff pits Euro 1996 runners-up Czech Republic against Montenegro, who are bidding to reach their first tournament since gaining independence in 2006.

There are 12 teams already assured of their place in the competition, with co-hosts Poland and Ukraine being joined by reigning world and European champions Spain and 1988 winners Netherlands.

The other eight teams who have already qualified are Germany, England, Italy, Russia, France, Greece, Denmark and Sweden.

The draw for the group stage of the four-yearly tournament will be made on December 2, ahead of the competition's first match on June 8 2012.
