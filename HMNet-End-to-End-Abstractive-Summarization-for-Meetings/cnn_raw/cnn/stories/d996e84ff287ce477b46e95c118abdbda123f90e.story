8:30 p.m. -- Haiti's orphanages have become targets for people desperate for food, water and medical supplies, aid workers said. On Wednesday night, Maison de Lumiere, an orphanage caring for 50 orphans, came under attack from a group of 20 armed men, aid workers told the Joint Council on International Children's Services. A neighboring orphanage sheltering about 135 children has been robbed several times over the past few days, they said.

The U.S. has also evacuated approximately 10,500 people from Haiti so far, including 8,300 American citizens, the White House said.

5:59 p.m. -- The Senate unanimously passed legislation Thursday that will allow taxpayers to deduct cash donations to Haiti earthquake relief on their 2009 tax returns instead of having to wait to file the claims next year.

4:37 p.m. -- Haitians are lining up in the streets for hours to try and receive wire transfers at the banks and wire services open in Haiti. Some Haitians said they haven't been able to eat because they don't have cash to buy any food available at street markets.

3:34 p.m. -- The U.S. Southern Command conducted an air drop of food and water over Haiti on Thursday. A C-17 delivered water and 17,200 meals ready to eat , the military said in a statement. Thursday's air drop was the second since the quake; the first was Monday.

1:06 p.m. -- Soldiers at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have set up tents, beds and toilets in anticipation of a possible influx of Haitian refugees, a military spokeswoman said.

12:55 p.m. -- A Dutch Navy ship, the Pelikaan, was docked at Port-au-Prince's south pier Thursday, unloading 90 tons of humanitarian aid. Two other ships previously offloaded containers.

10:52 a.m. -- One of two piers at the port serving the Haitian capital has reopened, and a gravel road was laid off of it, clearing a major route for aid to come into Port-au-Prince, officials said.

10:21 a.m. -- Save the Children, World Vision and a unit of the British Red Cross called Thursday for an immediate halt to any new adoptions of Haitian children after last week's earthquake, saying the focus must first be on tracing any family members the children may still have and reuniting them.

9:35 a.m. -- Haitians need donations of cash -- not clothes, food, medicine, or other relief supplies, as well intended as they might be, aid groups said Thursday.
