(CNN) -- The price of cassava, a root vegetable that is a staple ingredient in Liberian diets, shot up in August.

In the Redlight Markets of Monrovia, the Ebola-stricken country's capital, Liberians were forced to pay 150% more for cassava, a basic for flour and bread.

It's a small example, noted by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, which represents massive economic pain hitting the countries of West Africa. The total cost is now estimated to hit $32 billion over the next two years if it spreads to its larger neighbors, according to a World Bank report issued Wednesday.

Liberia has suffered most in the epidemic, which has killed more than 3,800 people and delivered an economic shock to some of Africa's most vulnerable economies.

Ebola cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone could rise to between 550,000 and 1.4 million by January if there are no additional interventions, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report warned.

Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- the three countries facing the biggest health crisis -- are also facing huge bills to try and contain the virus.
