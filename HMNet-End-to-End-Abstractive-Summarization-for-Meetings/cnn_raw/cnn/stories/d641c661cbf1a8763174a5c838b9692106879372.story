Today's State of the Union coverage goes beyond what was said in Washington last night. We have highlights of the president's speech and the GOP response, but we also feature a look at President Obama's legacy: what has and hasn't been accomplished in his first six years in office. We're also exploring a possible coup in Yemen and a potential medical breakthrough involving antibiotics.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
