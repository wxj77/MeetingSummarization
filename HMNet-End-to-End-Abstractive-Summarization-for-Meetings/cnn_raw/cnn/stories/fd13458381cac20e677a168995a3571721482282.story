(EW.com) -- Three big names have just signed on for guest roles in Mindy Kaling's promising Fox comedy pilot.

In the as-yet-untitled show, Kaling plays a Bridget-Jones type OB/GYN trying to navigate her personal and professional life. Here's the scoop:

First, Kaling's "The Office" co-star Ed Helms is in the show as a potential love interest. He'll play Dennis, a Wall Street analyst who goes on a blind date with Kaling's character Mira.

Next, "Saturday Night Live" and "Superbad" veteran Bill Hader has joined the pilot to play Kaling's ex-boyfriend Tom. He's described as "upbeat, humble, almost infinitely appealing boy-next-door type who has such perfect chemistry with Kaling's character that it feels nearly too good to be true. Mira sees him as the living breathing equivalent of an early 80's Tom Hanks."

And finally, "West Wing" veteran Richard Schiff will appear in the episode, too, as a former free spirit who's now "a menschy but accomplished OBGYN." The character "makes up Yiddish stuff hoping no one will catch him, is terrible with technology and tells stories about the 60s and 70s."

If the Universal Television-produced pilot gets a series greenlight, Kaling might exit NBC's "The Office." In other "Office" news, the show is seeking a new showrunner as Paul Lieberstein (who also plays Toby) seeks to focus on the planned spinoff.
