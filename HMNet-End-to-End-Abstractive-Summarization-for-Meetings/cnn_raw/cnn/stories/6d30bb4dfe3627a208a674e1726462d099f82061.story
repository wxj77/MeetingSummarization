(Mashable)  -- Can't get enough of Mark Zuckerberg? Well, if the upcoming movie "The Social Network" doesn't sate your desire for the Facebook founder, he's slated to star in his own comic book come December.

Bluewater Productions -- a Canadian production company specializing in comic books, graphic novels and multimedia that has previously told the tales of celebs like William Shatner, Roger Corman, Ray Harryhausen and Vincent Price, among other luminaries -- plans to release "Mark Zuckerberg: Creator of Facebook" as a 48-page saga that seeks to answer the question: "Who is the real Mark Zuckerberg?"

Is he the philanthropist who recently donated $100 million to public schools in Newark? Or is he the darker character we're all anxiously awaiting meeting in David Fincher's "The Social Network"?

"Rightly or wrongly, Mark dealt harshly with some people on his way to where he is today", says comic book author Jerome Maida. "As we see, he left many people feeling betrayed. I try my best to be fair here. No one is totally innocent in this story. I try to represent each of the major players' point of view."

Zuckerberg has become a figure of massive public interest over the last couple of years as Facebook has reaped both praise and torrents of criticism.

It will be interesting to see how history looks back at this period in the coming years -- we'll certainly have a trove of source material in the archives if this Zuckerberg-centric storytelling trend continues.
