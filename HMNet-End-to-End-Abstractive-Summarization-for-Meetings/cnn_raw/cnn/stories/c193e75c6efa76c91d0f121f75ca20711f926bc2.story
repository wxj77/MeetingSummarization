(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored a superb late goal to give Argentina a 1-0 victory over South American rivals Brazil in a prestige friendly international in Qatar on Wednesday.

The world player of the year struck in time added on to give Argentina a first win in five years against the five-time world champions, who they will meet again in La Plata on December 19.

The diminutive Barcelona gathered a pass from substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi and waltzed in from the right flank past four defenders before angling a low left-foot shot into the corner of the net.

It was Messi's first goal against Brazil, who recalled Ronaldinho for the first time since April 2009.

"It's always important to win and this victory is even more important because it's against a direct rival and it gives us confidence," Messi told AFP. "My goal was important because it enabled us to beat Brazil."

It was Brazil's first defeat in four matches under new coach Mano Menezes, who replaced Dunga after the team lost in the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup.

Sergio Batista, however, triumphed in his first match as fulltime Argentina coach as his side bounced back from the 1-0 defeat by Japan while he was still in temporary charge.

Brazil's Dani Alves hit the crossbar in the first half, while Messi fired a shot which grazed the woodwork.

The Colombia-born forward, who turns 18 next week, scored the only goal with five minutes to play after being set up by fellow newcomer Mikkel Diskerud -- a 20-year-old Norwegian midfielder whose mother is from Arizona.

It was South Africa's first defeat in four matches since the World Cup, with England-based striker David Somma -- who lived in the U.S. in his early teens -- making his debut for Bafana Bafana.

Paraguay romped to a 7-0 win away to Hong Kong, with striker Roque Santa Cruz scoring twice in the first half and Jose Ortigoza netting twice in the second.

Edgar Barreto, Marcos Riveros and Cristian Riveros were also on target for the World Cup quarterfinalists.
