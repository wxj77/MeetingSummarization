Road work is increasing across the nation in the wake of the economic stimulus plan.

(CNN)  -- During President Obama's prime-time news conference Tuesday, he talked about the economic stimulus plan designed to "jump-start job creation and put money in people's pockets."

The plan injects $787 billion into the nation's economy, and Obama said in his opening remarks that the money had saved the jobs of teachers and police officers.

"It's creating construction jobs to rebuild roads and bridges," he added.

In Oklahoma, 40 companies have bid on 15 new projects with the state's Department of Transportation, according to a report on KWTV.

Bobby Stem, a spokesman with the Association of General Contractors, said the $380 million in projects will put a lot of Oklahomans to work and help the state's economy.

"We're weeks away from people going out and putting on brand new boots and starting their new careers in road and bridge building," he told News9. See a U.S. map of stimulus grants for schools, water and sewer projects Â»

Southwest: Truck-driving academies full of students

In Amarillo, Texas, along one of the major transportation routes in the United States, Robert Mathews is teaching people to drive long-haul and other types of trucks.

The program at Amarillo College's Truck Driving Academy lasts six weeks -- three in the classroom, three on the road -- and costs $2,500.

"I read the newspaper every day, every day I'd find four or five places that needed a truck driver," laid-off oil worker Ben Touchstone said. "And all of them required a [commercial driver's license]."

Mathews said you can drive more than trucks with a new license.

"Once you have the CDL, you can drive a school bus, a Greyhound bus. You will have license to do that," he told KFDA in Amarillo. Watch video of the report on NewsChannel 10

And truckers are in high demand because of the city's location.

"This is the I-40 corridor," he said. "Everything goes past here from coast to coast."
