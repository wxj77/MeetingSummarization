(CNN) -- Bayern Munich dropped points for only the third time this season on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund held the Bundesliga's runaway leaders to a 1-1 draw at the Allianz Arena.

Reigning champions Dortmund have beaten Bayern in their previous four league meetings but had to come from behind to steal a point on this occasion.

Some tight defending by the visitors frustrated the home side in the first half, but the deadlock was broken in the 67th minute when Toni Kroos swept past two defenders before firing home a low left-foot shot into the right corner.

The lead only lasted seven minutes as Mario Goetze put away a chance from a Marco Reus corner to put Dortmund back on level terms.

Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller kept Bayern at bay during the closing stages to earn his team a point.

The draw keeps Jurgen Klopp's team in third place with 27 points and remain 11 points behind Bayern.

Stefan Kiessling's 37th minute strike earned second-placed Bayer Leverkusen a 1-0 over Nuremburg to close the gap on Bayern to eight points.

Fourth-place Schalke could only manage a 1-1 draw at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach and continue a poor run of form which has yielded just five points in six matches.

Ten-man Mainz sealed a 2-1 win at home to Hanover to move up to sixth in the table while Stuttgart climb to seventh after a 1-0 win away to Greuther Fuerth.
