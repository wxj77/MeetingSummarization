LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- For most people life can be boiled down to a few major decisions and a list of truly memorable events.

Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams hope love conquers all in "The Time Traveler's Wife."

Typically, these are first words, first steps, graduations, births, weddings and -- of course -- marriage proposals.

More than a few of these milestone moments take place in the new romantic drama "The Time Traveler's Wife."

Of all of them, perhaps the most memorable is a scene in which Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) asks Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams) to be his wife.

It's a complicated request because Henry, a kind man, also has the uncanny and often unfortunate ability to be transported suddenly and unexpectedly from one time period to another, leaving Clare on her own.

It's a peculiar set of circumstances that would give most women understandable hesitation when contemplating a marriage partner. But Clare is a woman in love, an emotion that tends to trump all others.  Watch how Bana and McAdams found humor in the scene Â»

Bana and McAdams sit down with CNN to discuss this scene, its comedic elements and what it means to both their characters.
