(EW.com) -- Broadway is about to get a little extra sparkle in those famous neon lights.

It was recently announced the "Twilight" musical is officially happening. Before you book your tickets to NYC (or, conversely, get the heck out of Times Square) you should know it's not expected to have a very long run. "Twilight: The Musical" will make its off-Broadway debut as a one-night-only staged reading on January 16, and the proceeds will benefit the charity Blessings in a Backpack.

The most exciting thing about this announcement may be the cast, and the plot teases their characters' names give us. In addition to Bella and Edward, (who already sings a lullabyâ€”why shouldn't he also belt out a Broadway tune?) the name that gets me onboard is the totally awesome Lauren Lopez (Alice), who played Draco Malfoy opposite Darren Criss' Harry Potter in the spectacular "A Very Potter Musical."

Other teases that make me cautiously optimistic this could be a lot of fun: characters named both Harry Potter and Hermione Granger will be showing up--perhaps leading up to that epic vampire vs. wizard war that we all know is coming.

According to the website the show, "examines our culture of obsession through the story of teenage outsider Bella Swan who risks everything when she embarks on a star-crossed romance with Vampire Edward Cullen."

The musical, which you can watch blurry clips of on YouTube, originally premiered and was workshopped last year in New York. With opening lyrics like "Nothing ever happens in Forks" and (of course) "I wish I had a boyfriend," the show seems to be in the same vein as "A Very Potter Musical" in that it's a fun-loving parody by people who clearly enjoyed the source material.

It will be interesting to see how far the production is able to get, as the show has no stated affiliation with Stephenie Meyer or Summit. Parodies are typically ok, copyright law-wise, but a show has to play up the 'unofficial' and 'spoof' aspects--the fact that the character names don't appear to be changed surprises me. That this one-night-only reading is for charity (aka no one involved is making money) probably helps. EW reached out to Dreamcatcher Entertainment (one of the producers) and they did not return requests for comment.

Love it, hate it, or some strange combination of both, I'm surprised a "Twilight" show hasn't happened sooner. Think of the musical possibilities for a show with the tagline 'death never sounded so good.' (Please resist the obvious joke in the comments). A teenage girl is in love with a guy vampire from the wrong side of the tracks living. Are vampires and werewolves really that different from Sharks and Jets? And try to tell me the werewolf chases in the woods aren't just waiting to be a shirtless staged ballet.

If you were in New York would you check it out? What scenes from the films are begging for a musical interpretation?
