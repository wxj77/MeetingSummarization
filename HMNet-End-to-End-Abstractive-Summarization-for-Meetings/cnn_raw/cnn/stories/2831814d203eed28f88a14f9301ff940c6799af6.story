Washington (CNN) -- Three-quarters of Americans say they favor direct diplomatic negotiations with Iran in an attempt to prevent that country from developing nuclear weapons, according to a new national poll.

Just one in five questioned in a CNN/ORC International survey released Monday morning say they opposed negotiations with Tehran.

President Barack Obama spoke by telephone Friday with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani -- the first direct conversation between leaders in Washington and Tehran since 1979. The call has raised the possibility that a deal can be reached over Iran's nuclear program.

Describing the conversation as a starting point, Obama said he believes an agreement is possible regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions that could lead to better relations.

"Large majorities in all major demographic categories favor negotiations with Iran over their nuclear program, including 87% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans. This is nothing new for the U.S. public -- in 2009, virtually the same number of Americans said they favored negotiations with Iran," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International September 27-29, with 803 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
