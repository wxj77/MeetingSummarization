(CNN) -- In-demand Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas has revealed that his future has still to be decided, amid continued reports linking him with a return to boyhood club Barcelona.

Fabregas left the Catalan giants to sign for Arsenal as a 16-year-old, but has been linked with a return in recent years, speculation that has intensified with the London club now six seasons without winning a trophy.

However, speaking at a promotional event in Madrid, Gunners captain Fabregas -- a member of Spain's Euro 2008 and 2010 World Cup winnings squads -- said: "I haven't yet spoken to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.

"He is the one who makes the decisions and I don't know if Arsenal want to sell me or not. I have my values and after everything I have experienced with the team for eight years, I'm not going to say something that could ruin everything."

The 24-year-old Fabregas has made no secret of his affection for Barcelona and that came to a head after the last year's World Cup victory, when he admitted he wanted to rejoin the club he left in 2003.

However, Fabregas has now conceded he might have erred in making his intentions known then. "I came out and gave my position and maybe I was wrong to do so," he revealed.

"Barca are the best team in the world and going there guarantees winning titles. Any player who says they are not frustrated by not winning titles is lying -- I am ambitious."

He added: "Everyone has their way of interpreting things, but in these decisions not everything depends on the player -- to say anything else would be to lie and give way to speculations that aren't true."
