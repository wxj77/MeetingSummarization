(CNN) -- Seven-times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong brought a Scottish town center to a standstill on Tuesday when hundreds of people joined him for a group bike ride.

Lance Armstrong's appearance in Paisley, Scotland, saw around 200 people joining him on a bike ride.

The seven-times Tour de France winner used social networking site Twitter to invite fans to take part in the event in Paisley, Scotland and -- as a result -- around 200 people gathered in the town's High Street.

Fans took photographs and asked for autographs from the American and the watching crowd applauded and cheered as the group set off on their ride.

Asked whether he was surprised to see so many people turn out, Armstrong told reporters before climbing on to his bike: "Yes. It's a chance to meet lots of people. We made up our mind to come and see a show two nights ago and I said hey let's have a bike ride," he added.  Watch the chaos as Armstrong starts to ride Â»

Asked whether he knew much about cycling around Paisley, he smiled and said: "I know nothing about it."

In the Twitter messages before the gathering, Armstrong wrote: "Hey Glasgow, Scotland!! I'm coming your way. Who wants to go for a bike ride with me??"

Followed by: "Hey Glasgow -- ride is at 12 noon. Stay tuned and yes, I have my rain coat!"  iReport: Did you see Lance? Send pics, video

Cyclists and fans started to gather before 11am ahead of Armstrong's arrival at around 12.20pm.

After the group cycle, Armstrong told fans through Twitter: "Thanks to everyone who turned up to ride in Paisley! I figured we'd have a nice ride for a dozen or so. But 100's came. Haha! Awesome!"
