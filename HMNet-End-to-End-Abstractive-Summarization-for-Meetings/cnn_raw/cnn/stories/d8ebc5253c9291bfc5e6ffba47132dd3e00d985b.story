(CNN) -- After cleaning house Friday and canceling a number of shows, NBC has unveiled its 2014 TV schedule.

As announced Sunday, the network has added three comedies and three dramas to its lineup.

Among the newcomers is David Caspe's "Marry Me," which stars "Happy Endings" actress Casey Wilson as half of a destined-to-be-duo who can't seem to get their proposal right.

On the drama side, NBC has announced new series like "State of Affairs" with Katherine Heigl and "Constantine," an adaptation of the popular DC Comics series "Hellblazer."

While NBC has said farewell to fan-favorite shows "Community" and "Revolution," it is keeping "Parks and Recreation" and "Parenthood," both of which will air their final seasons. The network's singing competition "The Voice" is also returning, as are "Grimm," "The Blacklist" and "Law & Order: SVU."

Here's a look at the network's new schedule (all times Eastern), along with sneak peeks at the new fall shows, which are in bold.
