(CNN Student News) -- September 26, 2013

After a U.S. senator holds the floor for nearly 22 hours, CNN Student News reports on why he did it, how some of his colleagues reacted, and some of the rules governing this marathon session. We also cover an earthquake in Pakistan, we describe statements from Iran's new president, and we hear some reaction to a new policy for disabled guests at Disney theme parks.
