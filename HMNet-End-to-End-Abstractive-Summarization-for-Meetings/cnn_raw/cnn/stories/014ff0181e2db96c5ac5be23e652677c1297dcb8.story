(CNN) -- It's become a popular segment on his show, and Jimmy Fallon's latest lip-sync battle featured "The Voice" coaches Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton.

So what happens when "The Tonight Show" host has two popular singers perform songs by not actually singing? A whole bunch of awesome, apparently.

The setup is simple: Each celebrity contestant selects a song and then lip-syncs a snippet.

Shelton kicked it off with Taco's '80s hit "Puttin' on the Ritz," including some faux tap dancing. That was followed by Fallon's version of Ellie Goulding's "Burn," and Stefani ended the round with "Call Me Maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen.

The trio seemed evenly matched until Stefani and Shelton took it to a new level. In a hilarious duet of "Endless Love," Stefani did the Lionel Richie part and Shelton subbed for Diana Ross.

Who do you think won?
