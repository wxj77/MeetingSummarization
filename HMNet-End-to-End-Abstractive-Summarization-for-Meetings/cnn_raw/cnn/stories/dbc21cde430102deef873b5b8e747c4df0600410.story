(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal warmed up for next week's Indian Wells hard-court tournament by thrashing David Ferrer in the final of the Mexican Open at Acapulco Sunday.

The former World No.1 claimed his 52nd ATP title, his 38th on clay, by seeing off his fellow Spaniard 6-0 6-2.

Since his return from a seven month absence with a knee injury in February, Nadal has won 12 of his 13 matches, coming second in Vina del Mar, Chile, before winning at Sao Paulo last month.

"I have had some difficult months, especially during my time away from tennis," the 11-time grand slam winner told reporters.

"But I take with me fond memories of returning to Acapulco. I feel good being back on court.

"I have to thank my family and everyone involved in my rehabilitation. It has been a difficult time over the last few months.

"My heart tells me I should continue competing, that I need to move on to the next tournament."

Nadal required just 65 minutes to defeat Ferrer, winning 81% of his first serve points, while saving both of the break points he faced.

"I am sorry about this result but I know Ferrer will be back and I consider him one of the great players of today," added the World No. 5.

Nadal dominated from the start of the contest, taking the first eight games and breaking Ferrer on five occasions.

"I want to congratulate Rafa. He is not an easy player to beat," Ferrer told reporters. "If I have to lose, I am happy to lose to Rafa."

In the women's final, Italian top seed Sara Errani breezed past second seed Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain 6-0 6-4.

In Malaysia, Karolina Pliskova won her first WTA singles crown after defeating Bethanie Mattek-Sands 1-6 7-5 6-3 at Kuala Lumpur.

Elsewhere, Latvian qualifier Ernests Gulbis won his third career ATP title by defeating France's Edouard Roger-Vasselin 7-6 6-3 at the Delray Beach International Championships.
