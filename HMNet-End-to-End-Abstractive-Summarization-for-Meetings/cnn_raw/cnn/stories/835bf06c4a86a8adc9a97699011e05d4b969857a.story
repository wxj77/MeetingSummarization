(RollingStone.com) -- There was no shortage of drama on Alanis Morissette's debut, "Jagged Little Pill."

So much so that the singer is expanding her 1995 LP into a Broadway musical that will encompass all the songs on the album, as well as other tracks from her catalog and new original tunes she will compose for the stage.

Tony and Pulitzer winner Tom Kitt, who worked on Green Day's "American Idiot" musical, will provide orchestration and arrangements for the musical, also called "Jagged Little Pill," and Broadway veteran Vivek J. Tiwary will produce the musical with Arvind Ethan David.

"Jagged Little Pill" is expected to debut as a workshop production next year.

Where does 'Jagged Little Pill' rank on our best albums of the '90s list?

"I look forward to taking the heart of 'Jagged Little Pill' and expanding its story, fleshing it out into ever deeper layers of emotionality, specificity, humanity, power, physicality, spirit and fabulism," Morissette said in announcing the musical. "I look forward to collaborating with Vivek and Tom and our whole inspiring team to create something greater than the sum of our parts."

In album form, "Jagged Little Pill" has sold more than 33 million copies worldwide, peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.

Morissette won a Grammy for Album of the Year for "Jagged Little Pill," which remains the best-selling debut by a female artist in the U.S. and was the highest-selling album of the '90s.
