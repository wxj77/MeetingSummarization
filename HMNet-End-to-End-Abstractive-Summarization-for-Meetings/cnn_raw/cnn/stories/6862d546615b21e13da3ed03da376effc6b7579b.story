(CNN)Airport authorities are clearly doing something right in Singapore. For the third year in a row, Singapore Changi Airport has earned the World's Best Airport title at the annual SkyTrax World Airport Awards, which were announced Wednesday in Paris.

"It is a great honor to be named World's Best Airport by SkyTrax for the third year running," airport CEO Lee Seow Hiang told SkyTrax. "This recognition is particularly pleasing for us as it comes at a time of transformation at Changi Airport."

The airport handles 5,000 arrivals and departures a week by 80 international airlines. This month, Changi awarded a $234 million construction contract for the expansion of Terminal 1.

The World Airport Awards, also known as the Passenger's Choice Awards, were launched by air transport advisory group SkyTrax in 1999. The 2015 awards are based on more than 13 million surveys completed by 112 nationalities of airline customers between May and January.

Incheon International Airport near Seoul is the No. 2 airport in the world, also for the third year running.

Germany's No. 3-ranked Munich Airport retained its 2014 rank, as did No. 4 Hong Kong International. This year's No. 5-ranked airport, Tokyo International (Haneda), climbed one rung from No. 6 in 2014.

The world's top 10 airports, according to SkyTrax:

1. Singapore Changi Airport

2. Incheon International Airport

3. Munich Airport

4. Hong Kong International Airport

5. Tokyo International Airport (Haneda)

6. Zurich Airport

7. Central Japan International Airport

8. London Heathrow Airport

9. Amsterdam Schiphol Airport

10. Beijing Capital International Airport

North America didn't have an airport in the top 10 this year. Vancouver International Airport, the No. 1 airport in North America for a record sixth consecutive year, fell in the global rankings from No. 9 in 2014 to No. 11 this year.
