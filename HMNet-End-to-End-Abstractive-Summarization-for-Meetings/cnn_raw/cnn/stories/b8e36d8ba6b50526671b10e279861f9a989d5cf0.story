(CNN Student News) -- April 18, 2014

This Friday, we show you how the town of West, Texas is rebuilding, one year after an enormous explosion claimed lives and homes. We also explore how the use of an illegal drug is more dangerous in some communities than crime and car accidents. And we take viewers from the ocean depths in a submarine to skyscraper heights in a convertible.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.
