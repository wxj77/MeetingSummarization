(CNN) -- A plane crash Tuesday killed six public servants working for Mexico's attorney general's office, officials said.

The crash in Zacatecas state occurred a day after the authorities onboard had carried out an arrest warrant against several suspected members of the Zetas cartel, Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said in a statement.

Authorities are investigating what caused the crash of the plane, which belonged to his office, Murillo Karam said.

The plane did not return to Mexico City as scheduled on Monday due to mechanical problems, he said.

Instead, the plane headed back to Mexico City at noon Tuesday. It crashed 10 minutes after takeoff, Murillo Karam said.

Two federal police agents and an agent working for the organized crime investigation branch of the attorney general's office were among the casualties. The plane's pilot, co-pilot and a mechanic also were killed.

CNN's Rene Hernandez and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.
