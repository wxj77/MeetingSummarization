(CNN) -- The Louvre has stood at the heart of Paris for 800 years - in turns, medieval fortress, royal chateau and renaissance palace. Most of the magnificent limestone edifice we see now is 17th, 18th and 19th century.

For the last 220 years, it's been a people's museum. And with close to 10 million visitors a year, it's the most visited art museum in the world.

Now we want to know what's your favorite work of art inside the Louvre. Is it one of the many magnificent paintings?

Maybe it's the small portrait of the mysterious Mona Lisa. Or perhaps it's a collection of Egyptian figurines.

Whatever it is, famous or obscure, small or big, we want to know, as long as it's an artwork in the public domain.
