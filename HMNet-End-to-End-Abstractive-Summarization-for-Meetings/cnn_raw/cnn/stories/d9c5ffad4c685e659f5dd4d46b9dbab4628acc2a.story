(CNN) -- Looks like your iPads and Mac will be getting freshened up in time for the holiday shopping season.

Apple on Wednesday sent invitations to media members for next Thursday under the headline, "It's been way too long."

Last October, Apple unveiled the thinner and lighter iPad Air and a revamped iPad Mini. The company also used the event to roll out its then-latest Mac operating system, OS X Mavericks. It also updated its MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops.

But Apple's desktop Mac line hasn't gotten a thorough update since June 2013. Most Apple analysts expect to see new Macs at the event, which will be held at Apple's Cupertino, Calif., campus.

There's also been talk of a bigger iPad, coming a month after the rollout of bigger iPhones. Some reports have predicted an "iPad Pro" with a massive 12.9-inch screen.
