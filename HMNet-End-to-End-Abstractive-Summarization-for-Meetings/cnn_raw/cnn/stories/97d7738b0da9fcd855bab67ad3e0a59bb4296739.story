SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir (CNN) -- A massive explosion has struck a highway overpass near the Indian-controlled Kashmir government's main building, injuring 17 people, according to police.

A large bomb rigged to a highway overpass in  Indian-controlled Kashmir exploded  injuring at least 17 people.

The blast hit a highway overpass near the Civil Secretariat, the region's seat of government, and its high court complex, senior police official M.B. Nathyeal said Wednesday.

None of the injuries were serious, the attending physician at the hospital said.
