(CNN) -- A typhoon off the coast of the Philippines is fueling monsoon rains, which flooded the capital city of Manila and could trigger flash floods and landslides, forecasters said on Wednesday.

The Philippine government said Typhoon Kabayan was expected to enhance the monsoon over the entire island of Luzon, where Manila is located, according to the country's National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council.

The storm system has maximum winds of 102 mph (165 kph) and gusts over 124 mph (200 kph), the council reported. It is forecast to be about 100 miles off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, by Thursday evening.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said that the western part of Luzon will experience monsoon rains on Wednesday, which could cause flash floods and landslides. The typhoon was reported to be some 656 miles (1,055 km) east-northeast of Basco, Batanes early Wednesday morning.

Government officials said relief goods have been positioned in areas that could be affected by the typhoon, according to the Philippines News Agency.

Officials suspended government work and college classes Tuesday because of the heavy rains, the agency said.

Veronica Lon, a CNN iReporter, said about 35% of metropolitan Manila is submerged under water and hundreds of families are in evacuation centers.

"This is a unusual scene in our city and always, it only takes a few minutes for the flood to form," Lon said. "More than half the city and about 75% of metro Manila area had floods," she said.
