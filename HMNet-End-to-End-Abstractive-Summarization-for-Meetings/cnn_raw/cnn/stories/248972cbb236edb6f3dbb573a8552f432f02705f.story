(CNN) -- A former member of Mexico's Tijuana Cartel was shot and killed in the popular Cabo tourist area, authorities said.

Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix was shot Friday night at a "party venue" at a beachfront hotel in Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California peninsula, the state-run Notimex news agency reported.

The agency said authorities received some reports that the attack was carried out by two men, one of whom may have been dressed as a clown.

Arellano Felix, 63, was killed by gunfire to the head, according to a statement by the deputy attorney's special investigations unit.

Arellano Felix had served time in prisons in Mexico and the United States, Notimex said. He was released from an American prison in 2008 on a conviction for selling cocaine.

Authorities said there were no pending criminal charges against him.

The U.S. Justice Department has said the Tijuana Cartel, which was responsible for kidnappings and murders in addition to drug and gun offenses, was run by members of the Arellano Felix family. As of mid-2013, three members of the family were in American prisons. Another was killed in a shootout with police in 2002.

State and military forces erected roadblocks in a search for the gunmen, but no arrests had been made Saturday night, Notimex reported.
