(PEOPLE.com) -- Heather Locklear was in "medically stable" condition at a Thousand Oaks, California, hospital Thursday night with her parents at her side.

"She is in no danger and she's going to be just fine," Bill and Diane Locklear said in a statement issued by Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center.

The "Melrose Place" star, 50, was taken to the hospital after the fire department and sheriff's deputies responded to a 911 call at her house northwest of Los Angeles. Reports say she may have mixed alcohol and prescription medication.

Los Robles spokesperson Kris Carraway-Bowman declined to disclose any medical information beyond Locklear's condition. The actress arrived at 2:30 p.m. and by 8 p.m. was sleeping, says Carraway-Bowman.
