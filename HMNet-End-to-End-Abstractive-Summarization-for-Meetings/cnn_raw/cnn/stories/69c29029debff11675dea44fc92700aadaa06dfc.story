(EW.com) -- Chuck Lorre's latest vanity card slams an actor as an erratic junkie on his sitcom set who was "impossible to work with." And the performer was... a monkey?

EW.com: Chuck Lorre's latest super-short vanity card

This just aired after "The Big Bang Theory" on the East Coast. You be the judge:

Dear Concerned Viewers,

Thanks to the magic of computer graphics, the monkey in tonight's episode was not actually smoking a cigarette, nor was he ever exposed to secondhand smoke. At all times, every effort was made to make the monkey feel happy and safe. Nevertheless, he proved impossible to work with. During the week of production his behavior became increasingly erratic, to the point of refusing to come out of his trailer to rehearse. It wasn't until after we finished filming his scenes that we learned why. The monkey is a heroin addict. Yes, hard as it may be to believe, the monkey had a monkey on his back. Thankfully, an intervention was staged by the Geico lizard and he is now going through detox and a twelve step program at the Bonzo Center in Palm Springs. Everyone at "The Big Bang Theory" wishes him well.
