(CNN) -- German Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich have confirmed Mark van Bommel as their captain for the new season, with Philipp Lahm named as vice-captain.

Bayern Munich captain Van Bommel will be hoping to lift more trophies for the Bavarian giants this season.

The Dutch midfielder was given the captain's armband by Jurgen Klinsmann last season after Oliver Kahn retired.

However, the arrival of Anatoliy Tymoschuk from Zenit St Petersburg seemed to suggest that Van Bommel's place in the Bayern team was no longer guaranteed, but new coach Louis Van Gaal has decided that his compatriot will indeed be one of the first names on his team sheet next season.

"We have been observing his behavior on and off the field over the last four weeks and the influence he has on the club and on the squad," explained Van Gaal's assistant Andries Jonker on Bayern's official Web site.

Tymoschuk must now fear for his place in the Bayern team after being told he is only second-choice behind Van Bommel.

And, since Van Gaal has made it clear that he wanted to choose a captain who will play every week, Tymoschuk may have to spend much of his first season in Bavaria sitting on the substitutes' bench.

"He cannot play in his best position in our system," admitted Van Gaal. "That is where Van Bommel plays. He could play on the right, but I have chosen Hamit Altintop for there. Every player is compared to his rivals and the coach makes the decisions."

Meanwhile, Bayern's French midfielder Franck Ribery has been declared fit to resume training after a summer spent battling tendonitis in his knee.

Ribery missed the pre-season Audi Cup tournament involving Manchester United, AC Milan and Boca Juniors and is not likely to make Saturday's opening Bundesliga home match against Hoffenheim.

But the France international, who was Monday called into his country's squad for the World Cup qualifier with the Faroe Isles in Torshavn on August 12, will be ready to train on Wednesday,
