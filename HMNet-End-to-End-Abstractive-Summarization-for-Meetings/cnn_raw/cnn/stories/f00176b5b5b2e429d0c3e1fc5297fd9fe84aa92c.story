(CNN) -- Heidi Klum has formally filed for divorce from singer Seal, almost three months after they separated, the supermodel's publicist said.

Her filing in Los Angeles on Friday marks an end to a romance that captivated the nation with its numerous displays of affection, including a vow renewal ceremony every year and a Halloween costume party that featured Hollywood stars.

The two separated in January after seven years of marriage.

"While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate," they said in a joint statement at the time.

"We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart."

Seal and Klum, who have four children, said their separation was amicable.

"Protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition," they said. "And for our children's sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy."

The "Project Runway" star has said she first met Seal when she was sitting in the lobby of a New York City hotel.

Seal is best known for his hits "Crazy" and "Kiss from a Rose," which appeared on the "Batman Forever" soundtrack.
