(CNN) -- Arsenal have confirmed that the supporter who threw a banana at Brazilian striker Neymar was a German national sitting in a section made up of official Brazilian ticket holders.

Neymar complained that he was subject to racist chants after scoring both goals in Brazil's 2-0 win at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium on Sunday, resulting in a banana being thrown onto the pitch.

However, on Monday both the Metropolitan Police and the Scottish Football Association praised the behavior of Scotland's fans, rejecting the claims that any racism had taken place.

Now the English Premier League club have issued a statement revealing that the culprit was not a Scottish supporter.

The statement read: "After consultation with the Metropolitan Police, Arsenal Football Club can confirm that a German teenage tourist has admitted throwing a banana onto the pitch during the Brazil v Scotland international friendly at Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

"The youngster was sitting in the North Bank of Emirates Stadium, an area of the stadium which was occupied by the official allocation of tickets to Brazil supporters, when he threw the banana onto the pitch during the second half of the match.

"The Metropolitan Police is satisfied there was no racist intent and have confirmed that no further action will be taken on this matter."

The statement backs up the claims of the Scottish Football Association (SFA), who had issued their own statement on Monday denying any racist actions from their supporters.

The SFA statement read: "There was no evidence of such instances but the Scotland supporters have confirmed they booed the player for perceived unsporting behaviour during the match.

"The tens of thousands of Scotland fans who travelled to London were, in fact, commended for creating a carnival atmosphere not just inside the stadium but across the city throughout the weekend."
