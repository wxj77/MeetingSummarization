(CNN) -- Her character on "The Big Bang Theory" could never discuss the rings of Saturn, but there's one ring actress Kaley Cuoco knows all about.

According to People, Cuoco has wed boyfriend and tennis pro Ryan Sweeting. On Wednesday, she posted a picture of herself on Instagram, decked in a pink Vera Wang gown, and kissing Sweeting with the caption: "Yep :) #thesweetings."

The pair had a whirlwind romance, getting engaged after just three months of dating. The actress said at the time that while she knew it was unconventional, the couple have a lot in common.

"It's been magic," Cuoco said. "We grew up with the same people, we just never met, so I kind of feel like I've known him my whole life. I know it seems a little crazy on paper, but it's what works for us."

Cuoco plays Penny, a waitress who is part of a group of friends including extremely educated scientists on the hit CBS show. She was previously linked romantically with "Man of Steel" actor Henry Cavill and her "BBT" costar Johnny Galecki.
