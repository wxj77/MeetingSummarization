(CNN) -- Olympic snowboarding medalist Shaun White has been charged with vandalism and public intoxication after pulling a fire alarm and breaking a phone at a hotel in Nashville, police said.

White was arrested after trying to flee the hotel in a cab and kicking a hotel guest who tried to stop him, according to a statement Monday from the Nashville Metro Police Department.

The 26-year-old "appeared to be extremely intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol," and his "eyes were red and bloodshot," according to the police report.

White ran from the hotel after an employee accused him of smashing a phone, police said.

A guest followed White from the hotel and called police, the incident report said.

"Once the guest told Mr. White that he called the police, Mr. White attempted to attack the man and fell and hit his head," the report said. White was taken to a hospital to have his head injury checked, police said.

The guest didn't press charges, but White was arrested on the other misdemeanor charges after refusing to sign a citation, police said.

Shaun White: A natural board talent

The U.S. snowboarder, once nicknamed "The Flying Tomato" for his distinctive red hair, was released on his own recognizance Monday evening, Davidson County sheriff's spokeswoman Melinda McDowell said.

White has been a professional snowboarder and skateboarder since his early teens, taking gold medals in the halfpipe competition at the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics. His representatives did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment.

CNN's John Branch and Jillian Martin contributed to this report.
