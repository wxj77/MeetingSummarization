(CNN) -- David Villa has become the top scorer in Spanish international history after netting both goals as the world and European champions fought back from going a goal behind to beat the Czech Republic 2-1 in Euro 2012 Group I on Friday.

Barcelona striker Villa netted twice in five second half minutes in Granada to take his tally for his country to 46 goals in just 72 appearances.

The 29-year-old had come into the match level with Raul on 44 goals, but the Real Madrid legend played in 102 matches to achieve his total.

The match also saw Villa's Barca teammate Xavi Hernandez win his 100th cap for his country, becoming only the fourth Spaniard to achieve that feat after Raul, Andoni Zubizarreta and Iker Casillas.

In amongst all the record breaking, the visiting Czechs threatened to cause an upset when taking a first half lead through Jaroslav Plasil's speculative long-range strike.

But Villa levelled in the 69th minute after being put through by Andres Iniesta and he secured Spain's win from the penalty spot four minutes later after Iniesta had been fouled by Jan Rezek.

The victory was Spain's 10th in a row in competitive matches following their loss to Switzerland in their opening World Cup finals match in South Africa.

Vicente Del Bosque's side have a maximum 12 points from their four group matches, with the Czechs in second place six points behind.
