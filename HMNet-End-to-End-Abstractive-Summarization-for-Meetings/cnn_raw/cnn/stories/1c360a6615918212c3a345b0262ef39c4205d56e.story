(CNN) -- Top seed Caroline Wozniacki secured the eighth WTA Tour title of her career after a straight sets victory in the final of the inaugural Danish Open in Copenhagen on Sunday.

The local favorite, who is at a career-high third position in the world rankings,  was always in control against seventh-seeded Czech Klara Zakapolova, sealing a 6-2 7-6 success.

Zakapolova threatened a comeback when she led 4-2 in the second set, but the Dane rallied to take it to a tie-break, which Wozniacki won to add the title to her triumph at Ponte Vedra earlier this year.

Meanwhile, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Agnieszka Radwanska will contest the final of the WTA event in San Diego after both players won their semifinal matches in straight sets.

Two-time grand slam champion Kuznetsova -- who is unseeded after dropping out of the world's top 20 following a disappointing year -- eased to a 6-4 6-0 victory over fifth-seeded Italian Flavia Pennetta.

"I was hitting the ball hard but I was also playing with spin and mixing it up and not letting her dictate," Kuznetsova told the official WTA Tour website.

"I'm playing better and I'm happy about that. I was struggling in the first set but I made my way through it and played much better in the second set. I'm happy to be in my first final this year."

The Russian will now face Radwanska after the fourth-seeded Pole saw off the challenge of Daniela Hantuchova 6-4 6-2 to reach her first final in 10 months.
