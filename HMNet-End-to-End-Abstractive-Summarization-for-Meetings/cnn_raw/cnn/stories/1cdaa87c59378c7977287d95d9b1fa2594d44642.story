(CNN) -- Turkish champions Fenerbahce have been withdrawn from the European Champions League group stage by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) in relation to bribery and match fixing allegations.

In July more than 30 people were arrested and jailed over claims that several football matches, as many as 19, in the Turkish first and second divisions had been manipulated. The highest profile figure arrested in the scandal was Fenerbahce's president Aziz Yildirim.

Fenerbahce won last season's title on goal difference from Trabzonspor. But as the arrests mount the TFF decided to withdraw Fenerbahce before UEFA, European football's governing body, was forced to act on its behalf.

"Regarding the heavy disciplinary sanctions both Fenerbahce and the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), which means Turkey might encounter, it is decided to ban Fenerbahce Sports Club from the UEFA Champions' League this season," read a statement posted on the TFF's official web site.

The move took place 24 hours before Thursday's group stage draw.

European football's governing body acted swiftly to end speculation over who will replace Fenerbahce by announcing that Trabzonspor, who finished second in the Turkish league last season, will take the final group stage berth.

After a meeting of UEFA's Emergency Committee on Wednesday evening it was also agreed that Spanish club Athletic Bilbao will no longer need to take part in a qualification match against Trabzonspor on Thursday and will go straight in to the Europa League instead.

"The panel considered that the Turkish Football Federation took the right decision to protect the game, fully in line with our zero-tolerance policy against match-fixing,"  said UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino in a statement posted on UEFA's web site.

"The Turkish Football Federation has shown with this decision that it takes its full responsibility in the fight against corruption."
