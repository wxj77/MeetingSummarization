(CNN) -- No charges will be filed against San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Michael Crabtree, who was investigated over an alleged sexual assault, officials said.

San Francisco police completed a thorough investigation, District Attorney George Gascon said in a statement issued Friday.

"Following a review of all the evidence, my office has determined that no charges will be filed against Michael Crabtree at this time," Gascon said.

The San Francisco Police Department released a statement on January 18 saying it was investigating "an allegation of a sexual assault involving San Francisco 49ers Michael Crabtree."

The complaint was about an alleged assault that occurred in a San Francisco hotel on January 13, police said, but the statement offered no further details.

A day before, the 49ers had scored a playoff victory, beating the Green Bay Packers.

Police on January 18 said Crabtree was interviewed with his lawyer present and he cooperated. The athlete was not detained or arrested.

After the district attorney announced there would be no charges, 49ers General Manager Trent Baalke said the team was pleased with Gascon's decision.

"Michael and the team can now put this behind us and move forward," Baalke said.

The 49ers will play the Baltimore Ravens at Super Bowl XLVII on February 3.
