(CNN) -- UEFA president Michel Platini claims that goal-line technology is not needed in soccer, stating it would lead to "PlayStation football."

World governing body FIFA will test possible goal-line systems in the coming months after reversing its stance on the widely-debated issue, but the head of the sport in Europe is not in favor of the prospective changes.

When asked about the potential use of goal-line technology during a visit to the city of Glasgow, the Frenchman referred to the popular video-game console when he told the Scottish FA website: "Then we will have PlayStation football."

Platini, one of the world's top footballers during the 1980s, believes more help should instead be offered to referees, highlighting the use of two extra match officials in this season's Champion's League as a better way forward.

"The referee has to be helped by clubs, fans, players, media and authorities," Platini said on Monday. "It is why we have added two assistants for Champions League games.

"One referee is not enough, not in the modern era where you have 20 cameras."

The 55-year-old also said the high media presence at modern-day games does not help match officials, with television cameras able to instantly see when mistakes have been made by referees.

"It is unfair -- the cameras can see everything but the referee only has one pair of eyes. Every time he makes a mistake, those cameras are there to focus on it.

"It is why for the past 10 years I have asked to change the job of the referee, to help improve the situation and to give the referees better support."

The subject of goal-line technology has long been hotly-debated within football, and the issue came to the fore once again at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa when England's Frank Lampard had a goal not given against Germany despite the ball crossing the line.
