(CNN) -- A Colombian has officially been declared the world's shortest man by Guinness World Records officials -- but his reign looks set to be short-lived.

Edward Nino Hernandez, who stands just 70.21 centimeters (2 ft 3.46 in) tall, inherits a title previously held by Chinese man He Pingping who died earlier this year.

But Hernandez is actually several centimeters shorter than Pingping, according to Craig Glenday, Editor-in-Chief of the Guinness World Records Book.

"Not only is he a new shortest man, he's even shorter than the previous record holder," said Glenday.

Although Hernandez is formally recognized in the 2011 Guinness World Records book published this month, he is not expected to hold the title for long.

Khagendra Thapa Magar, a teenager from Nepal who stands 65.5 centimeters (2 feet 1.8 inches) tall, turns 18 on October 14.

Glenday said Pingping, who died in March aged 21, had been an iconic character. "As a result of that there was a lot of interest from the small community. A lot of small men contacted us. When we heard about Edward's claim we sent one of our representatives over to his home in Bogota."

Hernandez, 24, was measured three times a day, both standing up and lying flat, with his official height calculated as an average measurement.

The 24-year-old works alongside his parents and brothers at a family business manufacturing pajamas. He likes dancing to reggaeton and salsa music, according to the Guinness World Records website.

"I am very happy to be recognized as the shortest man in the world," Hernandez told the Guinness World Records website. "Every person is different and unique. The more unusual you are the more you should fight and work harder."
