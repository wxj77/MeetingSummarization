(CNN) -- Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's marriage ceremony was the very definition of a family affair.

When the longtime partners wed at their estate in France on August 23, they made sure each of their six kids had a part to play in the event.

According to People and the UK's Hello magazine, which have exclusive photos from the couple's intimate wedding, the young Jolie-Pitts helped write their parents' wedding vows and even inspired Jolie's bridal gown.

The 39-year-old actress wore a sleeveless, floor-length custom Atelier Versace gown with a veil that was covered in her kids' drawings. The dress was reportedly crafted by Luigi Massi, and it looks like the luxury label's Donatella Versace had a hand in it as well.

Jolie and Pitt have been attached since 2005 and over the past nine years have become famous for their large, international family. At the couple's wedding, their eldest, 13-year-old Maddox, helped walk his mom down the aisle along with his 10-year-old brother, Pax, who also baked the wedding cake.

Shiloh, 8, and Knox, 6, were in charge of the wedding rings, while Knox's twin, Vivienne, and 9-year-old Zahara tossed petals they'd gathered from the garden.

In the end, the budding wedding planners threw their parents a more traditional affair than Jolie anticipated. When she and Pitt, 50, discussed their nuptials with their kids, Jolie was left with the impression that the wedding would be either "Disney or paintball -- one or the other," she joked in May.

But what was most important, the newlyweds told People, is "that the day was relaxed and full of laughter. It was such a special day to share with our children and a very happy time for our family."
