Barbara Walters' pick for the most fascinating person of 2014 is interestingly a celebrity who shuns such a spotlight.

On Sunday night Walters named Amal Clooney as the top selection for her annual list. The former  Amal Alamuddin married Clooney, one of the world's most eligible bachelors, in September.

Already an accomplished international human rights attorney, the new Mrs. Clooney was not well known by the general public prior to being linked to the award-winning actor.

"I guess the question is: 'What does it take to fascinate one of the most fascinating men in the world?' " Walters said introducing Mrs. Clooney as the selection. "She is known primarily through her spouse. And while we now little about her, we know a great deal about him."

Clooney had famously told Walters in a 1995  interview "I'm never going to get married again." The word spread so successfully, Clooney told Walters in 2006 that he no longer had to tell women he dated that he planned on staying single. "You did my work for me," he told her.

Snagging the perennial bachelor is what grasped the "most fascinating" title for his wife.

"Amazingly, Amal has been the subject of very little snark or envy," Walters said. "Maybe because we, like George Clooney, find it impossible to resist perfection. Or maybe it is because it is heartening to think that no matter how long it may take the perfect someone is out there for everyone."

Taylor Swift, Michael Strahan, Chelsea Handler, Oprah Winfrey, Scarlett Johansson, Elon Musk, Neil Patrick Harris, George R.R. Martin and David Koch also made this year's list.
