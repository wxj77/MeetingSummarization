Morales is expected to meet with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to "review issues of mutual interest" between the Islamic republic and the leftist South American nation, according to the national news agency IRNA.

The Bolivian leader arrived in Tehran from Libya, where he met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

Morales has described Iran and Bolivia as "two friendly and revolutionary countries," Press TV said. "The two countries are both energy producers and are staunchly opposed to U.S. hegemony."

Morales, a former labor organizer and the country's first indigenous president, was elected in 2005.

Like Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, with whom he maintains strong ties, Morales has sought to improve his relationship with Tehran.
