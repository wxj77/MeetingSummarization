(CNN)He may be suffering from the effects of a dislocated shoulder -- but golf legend Arnold Palmer has vowed that won't stop him from hitting his ceremonial opening tee shot at the Masters in Augusta next month.

The 85-year-old, speaking to reporters at the Trump Doral resort where he was opening a villa named after him, said he would look forward "to being out on that tee even if I fan it."

Palmer's injury happened when he had a fall at the Father-Son Challenge in Florida shortly before Christmas.

He explained: "I was going to make a speech at the Father-Son and I tripped on a carpet and did a 360."

But the four-time Masters champion, who hit his first ceremonial opening shot back in 2007, said nothing would prevent him from joining fellow greats Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player on the course on April 9 -- even though doctors won't allow him to swing a golf club just yet.

"Oh yeah, I plan on it," Palmer, known as 'the King,' said. "I haven't been practicing... I'm not allowed to swing yet. [But] I will whatever."

Palmer's Masters triumphs came in 1958, 1960,  1962 and 1964, and he made his final competitive Masters appearance -- and his 50th in all -- in 2004.
