(CNN) -- Serie A leaders Inter Milan have confirmed they have cancelled the contract of Brazilian striker Adriano with immediate effect.

Adriano walked out on Inter Milan to return to Brazil, citing depression and saying he needed a break.

Inter confirmed on their official Web site that they rescinded Adriano's contract from April 1st, after the 27-year-old walked out on the club to return to his homeland, citing depression and claiming he needed a break from football.

"Inter would like to thank Adriano for his 74 goals and the eight years spent together," the club said in a short statement.

Adriano joined Inter in 2001, although he had three loan spells with Fiorentina (2002), twice with Parma (2002 and 2004) and Sao Paulo (2008).

He played 177 times for the club, scoring 48 goals in 123 league appearances and 18 in 35 European matches -- winning the Serie A title in 2006, 2007 and 2008 as well as two Italian Cup victories.

Adriano was last seen in public on the Brazil bench during the April 1 World Cup qualifying win over Peru.
