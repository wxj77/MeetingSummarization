This year's Christmas will be hard to top for Joseph Riquelme.

Riquelme, creator of iPhone video editing tool Videoshop, gave his parents a gift that brought them to tears.

"Your house is paid off. Merry Xmas," Riquelme said in a handwritten letter that he shared in a Facebook photo.

An undeniably heartwarming video that Riquelme posted on YouTube under the name JoeyTrombone shows the exchange.

Riquelme pulls an envelope of out his hoodie and hands it to his mother. She takes a few seconds to read it and gasps, bursting into laughter and tears as she hands it to Riquelme's father.

"Oh, hijo," his father says to him after reading the good news.

"Sometimes the best gifts come in the lamest packages. Merry Christmas everyone!" Riquelme said in a caption accompanying the photo.

The video was shared widely after being posted on reddit, drawing more than 1.9 million views since being posted on Friday.

"Good job buddy. You are the type of person in the world who deserves to be rewarded," one YouTube commenter said.

"This is beautiful... I want to do this for my parents one day and I know I have to work hard for it," another said. "Thank you for this, you made your family proud and you made me get motivated."

Riquelme's Facebook friends shared similar sentiments, along with some others we all were thinking.

"Way to make everyone else's 6 pack of Costco brand socks for dad look even worse."
