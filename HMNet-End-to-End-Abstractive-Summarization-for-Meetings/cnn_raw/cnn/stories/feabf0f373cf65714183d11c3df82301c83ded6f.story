Sparks flew between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie the first time they worked together. Now Hollywood's hottest couple will share the screen once again.

Pitt and Jolie will co-star in "By The Sea," the upcoming drama written and directed by Jolie. The two A-listers haven't appeared together on screen since 2005's "Mr. and Mrs. Smith," where they met and fell in love.

The movie was a box office hit, offering audiences a glimpse at the first moments of Pitt and Jolie's high-profile romantic relationship. At the time, it was the highest grossing film for both actors.

Now almost a decade later, the parents of six are co-producing an "intimate, character-driven drama" picked up by Universal Pictures.

"By the Sea" marks the third time Jolie has taken on the role of director. She is in post-production on Universal's "Unbroken," a drama based on the true story of Olympian and war hero Louis Zamperini, to be released on Christmas. Jolie made her directorial debut with "In the Land of Blood and Honey," a love story set to the backdrop of the Bosnian War. The film earned a Golden Globe nomination in 2012.

It's not the first time the Jolie-Pitts are keeping it in the family by teaming up on screen. Jolie starred alongside her 6-year-old daughter Vivienne this summer. Vivienne played young Princess Aurora in Disney's "Maleficent." Shiloh also had a small part in Pitt's 2008 film, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."

Universal has "created a very special place for storytellers, and I look forward to the continued passion and support they have provided to me as a filmmaker," Jolie said.

Universal Pictures Chairman Donna Langley is equally thrilled to collaborate with the two superstars: "Angelina and Brad represent two of Hollywood's brightest talents," she said, "and we are excited to be a part of their collaboration on this powerful piece."
