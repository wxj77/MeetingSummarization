(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic swept past Spain's David Ferrer in straight sets to win the Abu Dhabi exhibition tournament Saturday and demonstrate he is in fine fettle for the start of the 2012 season.

Djokovic ended the regular 2011 campaign nursing an injury and by losing to Ferrer at the end of season ATP World Tour Finals, but there was to be no repeat as the Serbian won 6-2 6-1.

After victories over Gail Monfils and Roger Federer, it was ideal preparation for the World No.1 in the build-up to his defense of the Australian Open title next month.

It also earned him the $250,000 check in the winner-takes-all six-man invitation event.

Djokovic never looked back after sweeping into a 3-0 lead and was rarely troubled by his outclassed opponent.

Earlier, Rafael Nadal beat old rival Roger Federer to claim third place with a 6-1 7-5 victory.

But the Swiss maestro was unperturbed by his defeats ahead of the official season start next week.

"It's about getting ready and feeling fine out there and enjoying a great atmosphere here and having the chance to play world class players," Federer told gathered reporters.

"Trying a few things, see where you are at and see where the other guys are at."

It was a welcome win for Nadal, who lost to Ferrer Friday, and has been troubled by a shoulder injury ahead of the first grand slam of the season.
