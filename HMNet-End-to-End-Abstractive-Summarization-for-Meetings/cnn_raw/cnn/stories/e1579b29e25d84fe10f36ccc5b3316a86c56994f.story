(CNN) -- Italian striker Giuseppe Rossi helped himself to a double as Villarreal secured their first Spanish Primera Liga win of the season with a 4-0 thumping of Espanyol on Sunday.

The 23-year-old opened the scoring in the 23rd minute and added his second goal from the penalty spot.

Midfielder Borja Valero and Brazilian international Nilmar were also on target as Villarreal warmed up in style for their Europa League match against Dinamo Zagreb next Thursday.

In other matches on Sunday, former Danish legend Michael Laudrup is still waiting for his first victory as Real Mallorca coach, after his side lost 2-0 at Sporting Gijon.

However, there was better news for Laudrup's former club Getafe. The Madrid-based side, who finished sixth in La Liga last season. secured their first win of this campaign with a 4-1 thumping of promoted Levante.

The most remarkable match came at Zaragoza as the home side found themselves 5-0 down to Malaga after just 34 minutes.

Zaragoza did eventually claw some respectability back but Malaga were comfortable for their 5-3 victory.

Meanwhile, Saturday's matches saw a minor sensation as champions Barcelona were stunned 2-0 at home by newly-promoted side Hercules.
