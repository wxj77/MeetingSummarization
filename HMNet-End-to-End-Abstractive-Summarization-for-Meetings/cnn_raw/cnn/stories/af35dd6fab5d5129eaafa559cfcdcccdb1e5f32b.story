Sen. Ted Cruz apologized Tuesday to Republican senators for disrupting their schedules last weekend when he unexpectedly forced the chamber to be in session after Senate leaders had agreed to send everyone home.

"It was a sincere effort to apologize to those he may have put out," said Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, about the apology, which was delivered behind closed doors at the weekly Republican policy lunch in the Capitol.

The controversial move by Cruz -- what amounted to a procedural sneak attack -- caught his leaders and colleagues off guard.  Many were angry because they had already left town for family and holiday events and had to come back for a lengthy Saturday session.

"I think it's always appropriate to apologize for unnecessarily causing other people a distress or concern or requiring a change of plan that was completely unexpected," Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, said.

The schedule change also helped Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid move about two dozen nominations, some controversial, who otherwise might not have been confirmed before the end of the session. Cruz did not apologize for assisting the Democrats push through these nominees, senators said.

"I am pleased the Sen. Cruz apologized," said Sen Susan Collins, R-Maine.  "I believe it was warranted and I give him credit for doing so. I hope that he will learn from this experience."

Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, had flown home to take her daughter to The Nutcracker before getting word she would need to return.

"I appreciate his apology but they're getting a number of nominations," they otherwise wouldn't have, Ayotte said, still sounding frustrated.

"All he has to do is keep us informed about what his tactics are and what he's going to try to achieve and to what lengths he'll go," Heller said.  "I don't blame him for what he did. He had a position he wanted to take. I respect that. Just let us know."

A spokeswoman for Cruz did not respond to requests for comment.
