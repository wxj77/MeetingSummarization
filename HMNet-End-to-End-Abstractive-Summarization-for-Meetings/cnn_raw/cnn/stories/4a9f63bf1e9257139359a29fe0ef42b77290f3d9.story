(CNN) -- A homeless man who attended the MTV Video Music Awards with Miley Cyrus has turned himself in to police, authorities said.

Jesse Helt, 22, took center stage at Sunday's VMA broadcast when he accepted the video of the year award on behalf of the pop star.

He used the spotlight to talk about issues affecting homeless youth.

"I am accepting this award on behalf of the 1.6 million runaways and homeless youth in the United States who are starving, lost and scared for their lives right now," Helt said. "I know this because I am one of these people."

Shortly after his appearance, Oregon authorities said he had an arrest warrant that was issued in November 2011 after he allegedly violated his parole following a criminal trespass conviction. Helt grew up in northwest Oregon, where his mother still lives.

He turned himself in Thursday night, posted $2,500 in bail and left, according to Martin Silbernagel, the community corrections director for Polk County, Oregon.

Helt was initially arrested in October 2010 on burglary, criminal mischief and criminal trespass charges. The burglary count was dismissed, but he was convicted of the mischief and trespass counts, authorities said.
