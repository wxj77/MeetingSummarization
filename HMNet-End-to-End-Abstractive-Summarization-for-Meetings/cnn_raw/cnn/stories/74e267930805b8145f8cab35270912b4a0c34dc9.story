(Mashable) -- Facebook announced in a blog post Tuesday that Timeline will be coming to all users in the next few weeks.

According to a Facebook blog post Tuesday -- or rather, an update to the post published when Timeline became available to all users -- you will have seven days to preview your Timeline and hide content you don't want out in the open.

Facebook says you'll receive a notification at the top of your home page when Timeline has landed in your account. That seven-day preview period is the same for users who activate Timeline and those whose accounts are activated automatically.

The new interface and features have been opt-in, until the roll out becomes universal. Beginning in December 2011, users could enable the new look with one click, and then publish their Timelines for their friends to see.

Those particularly eager for the new Facebook could first access Timeline in September 2011 by creating developer accounts.

If you're confused by the new look, Facebook describes its new product, "Timeline gives you an easy way to rediscover the things you shared, and collect your most important moments. It also lets you share new experiences, like the music you listen to or the miles you run." Facebook's Introducing Timeline page walks new users through the new features, such as covers, stories and app integration.
