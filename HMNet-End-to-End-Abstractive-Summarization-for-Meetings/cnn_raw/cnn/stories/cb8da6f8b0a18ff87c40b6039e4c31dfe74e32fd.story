Los Angeles (CNN) -- Betty White is alive and acting despite trending on Twitter as having died.

Some White fans misread the headline of a satirical story published by Empire News on Wednesday that said the 92-year-old actress "Dyes Peacefully In Her Los Angeles Home."

Many took to Twitter to spread their distress, not realizing that "dyes" is not "dies" and without reading the story which only revealed that White "is not a natural blonde."

The story included an alleged quote from White's agent, Jeff Witjas, saying that she "has been dying her own hair in her home for decades."

"BettyÂ has often told me she feels it is relaxing and soothing to dye her own hair, peacefully in her home, where she can laugh and enjoy time with her animals," the satire quotes Witjas as saying.

Witjas is actually White's agent, but he told CNN that he never dished to the Empire News writer about his client's hair coloring.

Witjas gave a real comment to CNN Thursday, saying White "will outlive us all."

"Betty and I have an understanding," Witjas said. "I have told her that I have already booked her when she turns 100 and there is no out clause. Betty never backs out of a date."

White, who has enjoyed a resurgence of late, has been busy acting in her hit sitcom "Hot in Cleveland," which just reached the 100-episode milestone.

The Twitter distress about White calmed down by Thursday, transitioning more to the raising of eyebrows about how it could have happened and to joking about it.

"Why on earth would people ever make a hoax about Betty white dying? People are so dumb..." Brandi Diem tweeted.

"RIP, Betty. (Rinse In Peace.)" read a clever tweet by Andrew Klavan.

"A little thankful that Betty white trending isn't because she had some photos hacked," @bdbdleeroybrown tweeted
