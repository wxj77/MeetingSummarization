(CNN)It's probably no surprise to anyone who has flown through Atlanta that the city's airport is still the busiest passenger airport in the world.

Some 94.4 million passengers went through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in 2013, a decrease of 1.1% from 2012, according to Airports Council International's latest passenger traffic results for 2013.

Beijing Capital International Airport was in second place with 83.7 million passengers in 2013, an increase of 2.2% over 2012.

London Heathrow Airport remained in third place with 72.4 million passengers, an increase of 3.3%, according to ACI, the worldwide association of airports.

Tokyo International Airport (Haneda), Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport were in fourth, fifth and sixth places respectively, rankings that remained unchanged from 2012. Dubai jumped from 10th to seventh place with 66.4 million passengers last year and a 15% increase in traffic.

"With many major economies remaining in a fragile state, 2013 can best be characterized as a year of unstable recovery for the global economy," said Angela Gittens, ACI's director general, in a Wednesday press statement.

"Despite this challenging operating climate, worldwide traffic surpassed the 6 billion passenger mark in 2013," Gittens said. "This represents an enormous feat for the airport industry as we commemorate the 100th anniversary of commercial aviation in 2014."

Paris dropped from seventh to eighth place, Dallas/Fort Worth was ninth and Jakarta, Indonesia, was in tenth place.

Passenger traffic grew around the world last year, with the world's airports serving 6.3 billion passengers in 2013, up 4.6% from 2012, according to the report.

Atlanta's airport also ranked first in airplane movements (takeoffs and landings), with 911,000 movements last year. O'Hare came in second with 883,000 movements and LAX was third with 696,000 movements. Rounding out that list were DFW; Denver; Beijing; Charlotte, North Carolina; Las Vegas; Houston and Paris.

Hong Kong's airport is still the busiest cargo airport in the world, transporting nearly 4.2 million metric tons of cargo last year. Memphis, Tennessee, home to FedEx, came in second with 4.1 million metric tons. Shanghai was third with 2.9 million metric tons. (One metric ton is 2,205 pounds.)

The ACI World Airport Traffic Report was based on reports from nearly 2,000 airports in 160 countries worldwide.
