Washington (CNN) -- Many Americans are planning to get a glimpse of Prince William and his wife, Kate Middleton when they arrive in New York City next week -- and it seems that President Barack Obama wants in as well.

The President has invited Prince William to meet with him in the Oval Office on Monday. Before The Duke of Cambridge leaves the White House grounds, Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Biden are expected to host him in a separate event.

Kate will not join her husband on the D.C. leg of their three-day trip, opting to tour a child development center with New York City's first lady Chirlane McCray instead.

While it is unknown exactly what the two global leaders will discuss, Obama acknowledged William's commitment to raising awareness against illegal wildlife trafficking, an issue he is scheduled to talk about at the World Bank.

"The President welcomes the Prince's work in this global fight against what is both a national security threat and a devastating environmental problem" the administration wrote in a press release.

The trip will mark Prince William's first visit to the nation's capitol.
