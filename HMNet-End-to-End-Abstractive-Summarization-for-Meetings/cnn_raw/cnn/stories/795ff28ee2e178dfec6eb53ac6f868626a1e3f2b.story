(CNN) -- A Texas A&M football player missing since Monday has been found safe, police said Thursday.

Aggie wide receiver Thomas Johnson was one of the many players celebrating Saturday after the Aggies' surprising win against then-No. 1 Alabama.

Days later, the freshman wide receiver was missing, and fans, students and family members were getting worried.

Police did not immediately say where Johnson was found.

Before he was found, Johnson was last seen Monday night leaving his off-campus apartment in College Station, Texas, police said.

The teen is from the Dallas area, and his mother had been traveling to College Station to help, CNN affiliate KHOU reported.

The worried mother said she had been praying for good news.

"I know God is in it," Linda Hanks told the affiliate before her son was found. "And if he's in it, it's going to be OK. But that doesn't stop me from crying, doesn't stop me from wondering and doesn't help me sleep."

Johnson's mysterious absence came just after one of the biggest victories in recent history for Texas A&M.

The Aggies bested Alabama 29-24 on Saturday, beating a team that won the college football championship last year and was favored to win it again.

Johnson had three catches in that game.
