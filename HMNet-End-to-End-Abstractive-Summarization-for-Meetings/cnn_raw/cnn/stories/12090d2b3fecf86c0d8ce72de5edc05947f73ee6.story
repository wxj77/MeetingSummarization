(CNN) -- Monday's debate didn't end when the cameras shut off.

The thousands of readers on CNN.com continued the conversation well into the evening after President Barack Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney met in their final face-to-face matchup of the presidential campaign.

Readers posted more than 4,500 comments on CNNPolitics.com's 5 things we learned in the debate and many were inspired to make lists of their own.

As you can imagine, the comments split along partisan lines, but some commenters said they heard enough to know they don't want either man to be president.

5 things I have learned from this debate about Foreign Policy from Romney
1. Mitt Romney has no clue where Iran really is
2. Romney would agree with the president's current foreign policy, then attack him on the same foreign policies that he just agreed with, then present his own foreign policy, that amazingly is exactly the same as the president's.
3. I thought Mitt was originally against a timetable to leave Afghanistan in 2014, calling it foolish and harmful, but now he seems to be all for it.
4. Mitt is as detailed about foreign policy as he is on loopholes.
5. On Syria, Romney has cried that we are not doing enough. The president said that we are doing everything we can that is short of direct military intervention. And Mitt said again it was the wrong course to take. So one can only assume that according to Mitt the only other course would be a hot conflict. Where would we get the money to pay for this conflict, if you refuse to raise taxes?

5 things I learned from this debate:
1. Romney gave long answers but ended up agreeing with President Obama on most points. He shook his Etch-A-Sketch once again.
2. Romney played it too safe and in so doing did not look as knowledgeable about his changing positions.
3. President Obama talked the talk and walked the walk last night. He looked, talked and acted presidential and I did not notice he was not white.
4. That when Romney is snarky and aggressive, the Repubs loved it and said it made him presidential, but when President Obama pushes back it makes him look snarky, aggressive and un-presidential!
5. Romney does sweat!
