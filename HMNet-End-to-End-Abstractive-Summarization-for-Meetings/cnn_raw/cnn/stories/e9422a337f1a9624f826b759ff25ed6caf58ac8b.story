(CNN) -- Sorry, "Potter" fans, Harry himself says not to count on another film.

Despite the excitement over a new "Harry Potter" story written by J.K. Rowling, the man who played Potter doesn't want folks to read too much into it. The Independent reported that Daniel Radcliffe was asked about the possibility of a new "Harry Potter" film while appearing via satellite at the Television Critics Association summer press tour.

His response makes it seem like there won't be any conjuring of an addition any time soon.

"My inclination is to say 'no' because I don't think it's even a hypothetical at the moment," he reportedly said. "What she's written -- and I haven't read yet but I will -- I understand it's a very short piece. And he's 12 years older than I am now."

Rowling recently posted a short story on her "Pottermore" site that gives a glimpse into the life of a 30-something Potter. In the new story, the character is described as, "About to turn 34, there are a couple of threads of silver in the famous Auror's black hair, but he continues to wear the distinctive round glasses that some might say are better suited to a style-deficient 12-year-old."

Radcliffe has gone on to some more adult roles, including appearing nude on Broadway. He said his more risque roles may be a bit of a reaction to having been a child star in the family-oriented "Potter" films.

"What it is, I played only one character for such a long time, I think there's a little bit of envy and desire to try as many different things as possible," Radcliffe said. "Now that I'm in that position, I'm trying to while the getting is good."
