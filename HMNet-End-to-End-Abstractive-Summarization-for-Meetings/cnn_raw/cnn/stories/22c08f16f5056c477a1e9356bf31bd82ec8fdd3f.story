(CNN) -- The death toll from a shooting at a Nevada IHOP restaurant has risen to four, officials said early Wednesday morning.

A gunman carrying a variant of an AK-47 rifle opened fire on uniformed Nevada National Guard members as they were having breakfast at the Carson City restaurant Tuesday morning.

In all, 11 people were shot.

Of them, one civilian was killed as were two National Guard members. Another National Guard member, who was taken to a hospital and underwent surgery, later died -- bringing the toll to four, said Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong.

The attacker also died of a self-inflicted wound after the shooting.

The suspected gunman was identified as Eduardo Sencion, 32, who lived in Carson City and worked at a family business in South Lake Tahoe, California, authorities said. Authorities said they had not determined a clear motive.

"To say that he was targeting before he came into the restaurant those military persons, we have not been able to establish," Furlong said. "Clearly, the fact that five of the 11 were military draws a concern by us."

Sencion had no previous criminal record on file but his family indicated he may have had mental health issues, Furlong told reporters.

The shooting began shortly before 9 a.m. When authorities arrived, those who called in the incident identified the shooting suspect as a man lying wounded in the parking lot between two vehicles. The suspect had continued firing in the parking lot after leaving the restaurant, Furlong said.

The AK-47 was recovered as well as an empty 30-round gun magazine and two other gun magazines. A pistol and assault rifle were found in or near a vehicle, the sheriff said.

Steven Martin, a witness, told CNN Reno affiliate KRNV that he ran to see if he could help after he heard the shots. "There was blood everywhere; broken glass everywhere. It was just a war zone down there," he said.

The shooting took place just a few miles from the Nevada National Guard state headquarters in Carson City.
