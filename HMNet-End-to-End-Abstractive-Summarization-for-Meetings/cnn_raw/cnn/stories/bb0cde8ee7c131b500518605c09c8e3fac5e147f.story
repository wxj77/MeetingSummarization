(CNN) -- A high-speed car accident in Florida has left the teenage son of wrestling star Hulk Hogan seriously injured and a companion in critical condition late Sunday, police said.

TV footage shows a person injured in Nick Hogan's car crash being treated in an ambulance.

Nick Bollea, 17, was the driver of a Toyota Supra that went out of control while driving at a "high rate of speed" about 7:30 p.m. Sunday, said Wayne Shelor, a spokesman for the Clearwater police in Clearwater, Florida.

The car "inexplicably left the roadway," jumped across a raised median and slammed into a palm tree just east of downtown, Shelor said.

"It destroyed the car," he said.

Firefighters had to extract Bollea and his passenger, whose identity was not immediately released, from the wreckage. Both were flown to a hospital in nearby St. Petersburg, Florida, Shelor said.

"They're both down there. Nick's father is down there," he said.  Watch Hulk Hogan on the scene with the mangled car Â»

Hulk Hogan, one of the top professional wrestlers of the 1980s and 1990s, is now featured in the VH1 reality show "Hogan Knows Best." His son, wife Linda and daughter Brooke regularly appear on the show.

One episode documented the son's interest in a type of high-speed car racing known as "drifting."

Shelor said there was no evidence of drag racing or "drifting" in Sunday's wreck.

Police said Bollea -- known to viewers as "Nick Hogan" -- was not as seriously hurt as his passenger, who was listed as critical.

Shelor said the wreck forced police to shut down mile-long Court Street, the main east-west road through central Clearwater, as they investigated the accident.

"I will have this road closed for a minimum of four hours," he said. "It was a spectacular wreck." E-mail to a friend
