(CNN) -- Newman, Jerry Seinfeld's diabolical nemesis and United States postal worker, was denied his dream transfer to Hawaii when the Post Office discovered he hadn't been delivering a lot of the mail he was supposed to be.

Unfortunately for Brent Morse, life isn't a Hollywood sitcom.

The former Kentucky postal worker was sentenced to six months in federal prison for "destroying, hiding and delaying the delivery of at least 44,900 pieces of mail," according to David J. Hale, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Kentucky.

Morse, a mail carrier for five years, stored the nearly 45,000 pieces of undelivered mail at his deceased mother's home and, just like Newman, at rented storage facilities near his home and mail route in western Kentucky.

The majority of the mail was meant for around 250 homes in the community of Dawson Springs, and it was meant to be delivered between March 2011 and March 2013, Hale said.

Adel Valdes, a U.S. Postal Inspector in Louisville, said Morse's motive was: "He wanted to pick up his kids from school every day at a certain time."

Valdes said the owner of one of the storage centers noticed a large amount of mail and USPS equipment when Morse failed to properly shut his unit's door, so he called authorities.

Morse, 34, was not charged with stealing the contents of the undelivered mail, according to Hale, but he was ordered to pay nearly $15,000 in restitution for losses incurred by two businesses that mail commercial circulars.

The USPS has since delivered the recovered mail.
