(CNN) -- Well played, fake Scott Weiland.

A man arrested July 26 by Beverly Hills police on suspicion of shoplifting at a local Rite Aid and alleged drug possession was somehow able to convince police he was the Stone Temple Pilots frontman. But the real Weiland -- upon seeing a report on TMZ's website posted Thursday that he was in jail -- quickly recorded a video and posted it on his Facebook page to prove that he was free.

"I just got done reading something very interesting, a nice piece of fiction from TMZ saying that I was in jail and have been for four months," the musician said in the video. "I've actually been touring, writing and recording my new album."

Weiland has had run-ins with police before due to problems with addiction.

For its part, TMZ said that -- after seeing an obviously not incarcerated Weiland -- the site "then called the Sheriff's Dept. back but they were unwavering, telling us they did a 'physical check' on the inmate and insisted Scott 'was definitely in custody.' "

"The BHPD got back to us late Thursday night and said they made a BIG mistake ... the inmate is actually a 44-year-old guy named Jason Michael Hurley," TMZ reported. "They discovered it through belated FBI fingerprint analysis, even though he's been locked up since July 26."

According to the Los Angeles Times, Hurley gave police the name and birthdate of Weiland and now probably also face charges of giving false information to officers. Hurley remains in the Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles.

Weiland had a few arrests in the 1990s for drug possession and completed a stint in rehab in 2008 after being arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of drugs.
