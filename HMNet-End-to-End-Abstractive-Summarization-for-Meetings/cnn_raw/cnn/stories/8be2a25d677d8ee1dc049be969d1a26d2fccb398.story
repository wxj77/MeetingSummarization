(CNN) -- Kevin McCarthy, whose 65-year-long acting career included the horror classic "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," died Saturday. He was 96.

The chiseled-jaw character actor appeared in hundreds of films and television shows, starting in 1945, according to the Internet Movie Database.

McCarthy died of natural causes at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Massachusetts, according to hospital spokeswoman Robin Lord.

In addition to "Body Snatchers" in 1956, McCarthy was known for his role as Biff in the film adaptation of Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman," released in 1951. He was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar and won a Golden Globe for that performance.

McCarthy also frequently appeared on Broadway, including his one-man show "Give 'Em Hell, Harry!" in which he played President Harry Truman.
