Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Three bomb blasts rocked the southern Thai border city of Sungai Kolok, leaving at least four people dead and 118 wounded, officials said.

The explosions happened Friday night in Thailand's Narathiwart Province, according to the country's Ministry of Public Health.

Authorities believe the bombs were planted in a car and motorcycle, and detonated with some form of coordination, according to military spokesman Col. Prinya Chaidilok.

He said the incident was carried out by "drug gangs" retaliating after a narcotics crackdown by authorities last week.

Sungai Kolok, which borders Malaysia in southern Thailand, is a popular tourist destination for Thais and Malaysians.
