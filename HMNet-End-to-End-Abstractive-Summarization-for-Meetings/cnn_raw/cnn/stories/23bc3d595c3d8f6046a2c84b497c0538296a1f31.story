(CNN) -- India is trying to reclaim the famous metal-rimmed glasses and some other artifacts from freedom leader Mahatma Gandhi that are up for auction next week in New York, a top official said Saturday.

Mahatma Gandhi was known for his peaceful opposition to tyranny, which led to India's independence.

"The government will be doing whatever is required to get them back," India's culture ministry secretary Jawhar Sircar told CNN.

He said there were "several options" in place for India.

When asked whether India planned any indirect participation in the bidding reportedly scheduled next week at the Antiquorum auction house on New York's Madison Avenue, he said it is one of the "speculative" options.

"I can't disclose what (exactly) those options are. But we are doing something," Sircar remarked.

The glasses are scheduled to be auctioned off along with Gandhi's pocketwatch, sandals, bowl, and plate with letters of authenticity, according to the Web site for Antiquorum, which specializes in watches.

The glasses and other items are estimated to sell for as much as $30,000, the Web site said.

CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.
