(CNN)The baconification of America just reached a new level.

No longer is it enough to have bacon on your pizza. A new menu offering from Little Caesars will also wrap 3.5 feet of bacon around the pizza's crust.

The chain's Bacon Wrapped Crust Deep! Deep! Dish Pizza was announced Wednesday and will be available nationwide Monday.

The rectangular, deep-dish pie comes wrapped in whole strips of thick-cut, crispy bacon, then topped with pepperoni and even more chewy pieces of bacon. The pizza will be available for a limited time.

It's a diet buster for sure, although Little Caesar's claims there are more fattening items out there.

"Nutrition wise, compared to other pizzas or fast food items in the market, it's really not astronomical -- if you're going to indulge, this pizza is definitely worth it," Little Caesars spokesperson Tina Taylor tells CNN.

At 450 calories and 23 grams of fat per slice, the new bacon-wrapped pie is "healthier" than a McDonald's Big Mac, which tops out at 530 calories and 27 grams of fat.

At $12, Taylor asks, "What could be more delicious than a pizza wrapped in bacon?" Indeed.
