Job fairs are becoming more popular and are seeing record attendance.

(CNN) -- A record number of senior citizens attended a job fair this week in Loveland, Colorado.

The fair, which targeted people 50 and older, drew the biggest crowd -- about 900 people -- for the annual event.

Nan Cooper, a job seeker, said applicants have to do more these days than just walk into a prospective employer's office with a resume.

"[Times] have changed radically," she told KMGH in Denver. "I've spent countless, countless hours on the Internet and filling out applications."  iReport.com: Share your job hunt story

She said she had even applied for jobs through the online auction site eBay.

Northeast: Job week seeks to solve 'disconnect' between employers, job hunters

Employers in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area say they are having a difficult time filling 22,000 available positions.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said this week the city would increase its participation in a job placement program, both monetarily and through city organizations.

The mayor made his remarks as part of a kickoff event for Imagine Career Week, which links high school students and employers.

A spokesman for one of the groups sponsoring the week's events said there shouldn't be so many employers with open spots.

"At the same time, we have young people walking around famously saying that they can't find a job. There's a big disconnect there someplace," Paul Leger of the Allegheny Conference told WTAE.

During the career week, students will visit businesses and prospective employers will visit classrooms.
