(CNN) -- A 12-year-old girl allegedly kidnapped in South Carolina is back home after federal agents arrested the man accused of taking her, the FBI said Friday.

FBI agents found Jesus Alanda Lozada, 26, and Julieta Yoselin at a home in Atlanta, Georgia, late Thursday night. Yoselin had last been seen Monday in the parking lot of a drug store in Clemson, South Carolina.

Authorities thought that Lozada, a friend of Julieta's family, might be taking the girl to Mexico. The investigation led authorities to Atlanta.

Lozada was being held in Atlanta, the FBI said.
