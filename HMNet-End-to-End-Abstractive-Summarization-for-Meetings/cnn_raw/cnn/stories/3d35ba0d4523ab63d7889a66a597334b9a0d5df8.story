(Mashable) -- You know there's something significant going on when Google creates one of its whimsical "doodles" on its home page, and Halloween is no exception.

In case you can't see it where you are, this year (in some countries), there's a time-lapse video showing some of the most gigantic pumpkins in the world, going through a metamorphosis from blobs of orange to art as night falls.

Here's how the Googlers describe the making of this kooky video on the official Google blog:

"To celebrate Halloween this year, the doodle team wanted to capture that fascinating transformation that takes place when carving a pumpkin. Instead of picking up a few pumpkins from the grocery store, however, we decided to work on six giant pumpkins, specially delivered from nearby Half Moon Bay (some weighing well over 1,000 pounds). What you see is a timelapse video of the approximately eight hours we spent carving in the middle of our Mountain View, California, campus."
