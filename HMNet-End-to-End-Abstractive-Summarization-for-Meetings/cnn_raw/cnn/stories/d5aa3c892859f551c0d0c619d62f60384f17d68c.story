LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The date of the funeral for pop legend Michael Jackson has been changed to September 3, the singer's spokesman said Friday.

Michael Jackson's burial will be at Glendale Forest Lawn Memorial Park on Thursday, September 3.

Jackson was scheduled to be laid to rest August 29, on what would have been his 51st birthday.

The private ceremony will still take place at Glendale Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, according to a statement from Ken Sunshine.

No reason was given for the change in date.

The ceremony "will be limited to family and close friends," the statement said.

Jackson died June 25 of cardiac arrest. The famed entertainer was 50.

The release date for the movie drawing on Jackson's rehearsal footage was announced Thursday. "Michael Jackson: This Is It" will run in theaters worldwide for two weeks only beginning October 28, according to Sony Pictures.

Tickets for the film go on sale Sunday, September 27, Sony said in a news release Thursday.

"Audiences will be given a privileged and private look at the singer, dancer, filmmaker, architect, and genius as he creates and perfects his final show," Sony said.

Kenny Ortega, who was working with Jackson to create the "This Is It" concert, is also directing the documentary.
