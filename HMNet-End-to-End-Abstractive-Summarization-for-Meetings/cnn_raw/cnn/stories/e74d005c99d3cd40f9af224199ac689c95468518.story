(CNN) -- Donald Glover was apparently just feeling all of his feelings. Or as his character Troy might say, "My emotions!"

After posting a series of notes via Instagram in which he shared some of his fears, the 30-year-old "Community" actor told People magazine that he "just wanted to write down my feelings. I definitely was just expressing myself." He is not, he explained, depressed.

"If I'm depressed, everybody's depressed," he says. "I don't think those feelings are that different from what everybody's feeling. Most people just don't tell everybody."

Glover's notes covered a wide range of his worries, including his concern for his future and his worry that he may be "letting everyone down." Without elaborating on a potential illness, Glover said he has been "sick this year" and has been feeling helpless.

"I was just tired of telling people I was tired. It felt like every day someone would ask, 'What's wrong. Are you OK?' " Glover told People "And I would say, 'I'm tired, I'm tired.' I didn't want to do that anymore. I guess sometimes not telling the truth is just as bad as telling a lie."

The actor said he doesn't regret sharing his emotions at the time.

"I'm glad people saw it. I feel like I got some stuff out there," he said. "I got it off my chest. It felt like I had been holding on to something."
