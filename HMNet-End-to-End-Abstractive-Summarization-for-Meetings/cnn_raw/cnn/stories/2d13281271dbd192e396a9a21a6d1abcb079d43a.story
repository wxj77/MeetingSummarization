London (CNN) -- Singer Justin Bieber kept thousands of fans and their tired, outraged parents up way past their bedtime Monday after arriving on stage nearly two hours late for a sold out show at London's O2 Arena.

Bieber was greeted by choruses of boos from the sell-out crowd amid scenes of tearful devastation as scores of sobbing school-aged "Beliebers" were hauled away minutes into the singer's set by parents desperate to catch last trains home on a school night.
