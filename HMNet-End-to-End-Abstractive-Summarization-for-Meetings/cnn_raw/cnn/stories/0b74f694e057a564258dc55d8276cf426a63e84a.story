WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was hospitalized Thursday after falling ill in her chambers, the court confirmed.

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg became ill in her chambers on Thursday.

Ginsburg, 76, felt faint, light-headed and fatigued about 4:50 p.m., around an hour after receiving a treatment for iron deficiency, the court said in a statement.

She was monitored by an in-house physician, who performed blood tests and found her to be in stable health.

Her symptoms improved, though she was taken to the Washington Hospital Center as a precaution at about 7:45 p.m., according to the court statement.

Ginsburg had surgery in February for pancreatic cancer. She termed the removal of her cancer "successful" and was back on the bench 18 days later when the high court resumed oral arguments.

Ginsburg, who was appointed by President Clinton, has been on the Supreme Court since 1993. She was the second woman appointed to the court.
