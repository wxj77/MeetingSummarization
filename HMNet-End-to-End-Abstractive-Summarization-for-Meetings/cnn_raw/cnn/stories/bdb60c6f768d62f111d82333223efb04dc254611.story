London (CNN) -- Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's daughter was briefly held at gunpoint in central London this week, police and Blair's office said Thursday.

Police described the Monday incident as an attempted robbery. Another attempted robbery was reported to police about 30 minutes earlier, also in the Marylebone area of the capital.

In both instances, a firearm was seen, but no shots were fired and nothing was taken, Scotland Yard said.

Blair's office said his daughter is fine.

"Kathryn was with a group of friends," said Rachel Grant, a Blair spokeswoman. "No one was hurt and nothing was stolen."

Police believe the two incidents are related, and are asking witnesses to come forward.

The first robbery attempt was committed by one man wearing dark clothing and a balaclava -- a ski mask covering most of the face -- and the second involved two men, with one described the same way as the man in the first incident, police said.
