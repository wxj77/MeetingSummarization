Mexico City (CNN) -- A judge has given a Mexican singer accused of raping a teen a six-day extension to present evidence in the case, state media reported.

In a hearing Saturday that was closed to the media and the public, pop singer Kalimba signed a statement stating that he was innocent of the charges, lawyer Eliezer Garcia told the state-run Notimex news agency.

Prosecutors in the state of Quintana Roo allege he raped a 17-year-old girl in a hotel there in December.

Last week, the singer, whose full name is Kalimba Marichal Ibar, was deported from the United States to Mexico after an immigration violation in El Paso, Texas, U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Ramiro Cordero said.

The 28-year-old singer is a former member of the group OV7, and also was the voice of Simba in a Spanish version of Disney's "The Lion King."

After Saturday's hearing, an employee and a guard at the prison where the singer is being held asked him for his autograph, Notimex said.

Outside the prison, the news agency reported that hundreds of fans marched to show their support. Groups of teenagers carried signs and shouted, "Let Kalimba out!" and "He is innocent!"

About 500 fans also gathered to show support for the singer in the nation's capital Saturday, Notimex said, carrying signs that said, "Kalimba we are with you" and "Kalimba, cheer up, Christ loves you."
