WASHINGTON (CNN)  --   More than 33,000 items of old denim -- jeans, hats and jackets -- were sent to Washington in a recycling effort that will benefit disaster-struck homes, officials said.

Erek Hansen donated five pairs of his own outgrown jeans to the cause and collected almost 1,700 pairs.

National Geographic Kids magazine encouraged readers to donate their old denim instead of throwing it away.

The resulting 33,088 pieces of denim clothing set a world record, verified Wednesday by a representative from Guinness World Records, according to the magazine's blog.

The thousands of pairs of jeans, which are on display at Union Station for two weeks, will be turned into housing insulation for homes affected by natural disasters. According to the magazine, there will be enough material to provide insulation for 60 houses.

The jeans will be turned over to Cotton Inc., which collects used denim for natural fiber insulation made without carcinogens or chemical irritants. Paula Rosario, vice president of consumer marketing for the company, said that the new record "certainly attests to the civic-mindedness of today's children."

The ceremony unveiling the denim display also honored 9-year-old Erek Hansen, who collected nearly 1,700 jeans. The elementary school student from Curtice, Ohio, said that his friends and classmates "were happy to help the environment."

Hansen donated five pairs of his own outgrown jeans. The display also includes a pair from actor Ben Stiller.
