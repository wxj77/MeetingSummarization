(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday will sign an executive order outlining standards that companies operating critical infrastructure should follow to protect from cyberattacks, a source informed of the planning told CNN.

The order will also include an information-sharing provision to enable data exchange between the private sector and the government, the source said.

Obama has been considering such an order since last year, after Congress failed to move forward on cybersecurity legislation.

Administration officials have said that the failure to pass legislation has given the executive branch the incentive to fill in the gap with an executive order.

The administration still wants the Department of Homeland Security to regulate critical infrastructure and for Congress to pass legislation, the source said.
