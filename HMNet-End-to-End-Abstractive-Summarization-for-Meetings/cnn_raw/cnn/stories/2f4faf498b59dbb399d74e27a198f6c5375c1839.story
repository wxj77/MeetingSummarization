(CNN) -- Scott Jamieson was so close to breaking new ground at the Portugal Masters on Saturday.

No golfer on the European Tour had ever shot a 59, and there the Scot was on the 18th and last hole, needing a birdie to achieve the magical round.

But Jamieson couldn't convert a roughly 15-foot chip and had to settle for a 60, instead becoming the 18th man on the European Tour to card that score.

The world No. 110 couldn't hide his disappointment when he missed the birdie putt, sinking to his knees in front of expectant fans at the Oceanico Victoria Golf Course in the Algarve.

"I said to Richard (his caddie) playing 17 I really want to make a birdie here so we have a chance of it going down the last and I could not have asked to hit a better shot in," Jamieson told the European Tour's website.

"It pitched just short of the hole."

"When I birdied the 13th, I said to Richard then, 'A few more and we could be part of history.' I was definitely nervous but thinking about it from the tournament point of view the leaders are going to be a minimum of 16, 17 maybe 18 under going into tomorrow so that kept me going."

Jamieson only made the halfway cut by a shot but now trails leader Paul Waring by merely two shots in a four-way tie for second.

He won his first and only European title at the Nelson Mandela Championship in South Africa in December.

Earlier this year, American Jim Furyk became the sixth man to shoot a 59 on the PGA Tour.
