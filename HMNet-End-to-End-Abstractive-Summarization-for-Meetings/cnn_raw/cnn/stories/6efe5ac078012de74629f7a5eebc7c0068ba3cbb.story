(CNN) -- Serie A leaders AC Milan have agreed a deal to sign unsettled Italy international striker Antonio Cassano from Sampdoria in the January transfer window.

Italian news agency Ansa confirmed on Tuesday that the 28-year-old will finally be leaving the Genoa-based club following his highly-publicized row with Sampdoria owner Riccardo Garrone in October.

Cassano has not played a competitive match since falling out with Sampdoria, although the club recently failed to get the player's contract cancelled at an arbitration panel.

Although Cassano cannot officially sign for Milan until next month, he can join his new team at their winter training camp in Dubai from December 27.

Neither club has confirmed the deal yet, but Italian media reported that Cassano's contract will run until 2014 and that a â‚¬5 million sell-on clause due to his former Spanish team Real Madrid will now be divided between Milan, Sampdoria and the player.

Despite his undoubted ability, Cassano has proved a controversial figure during his career with Bari, Roma and Real, and has made only 20 appearances for Italy in seven years.

However, with Filippo Inzaghi ruled out for the season with a knee injury, Cassano was quickly identified by Milan as a replacement for the veteran striker.

Cassano joins an already star-studded attack which includes Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Alexandre Pato, Robinho and Ronaldinho, with speculation already mounting about the latter Brazilian's future following his failure to command a regular place at the San Siro this season.
