WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President and Mrs. George W. Bush reported taxable income of $719, 274 for the tax year 2007 and paid $221,635 in federal income taxes, the White House said Friday.

The White House opened the door to Bush not attending the Olympic opening ceremonies this summer.

They contributed a total of $165,660 to churches and charitable organizations.

Some of the donations went to the following: the Crawford, Texas, Volunteer Fire Department, Susan G. Komen for the Cure, Malaria No More Fund, Martha's Table and a St. John's Church, most likely St. John's Episcopal Church in the District of Columbia, where the Bushes sometimes attend services.

Vice President Cheney and his wife earned $2,528,068, the White House said, and owe taxes of $602,651.

The Cheneys paid $466,165 in taxes through withholding and estimated tax payments, and will pay the remaining $136,486 upon filing their tax return.

Bush's income included salary earned as president and investment income from the trusts in which his and his wife's assets are held.

The tax return also reports a $150,000 advance received by Laura Bush for the children's book she co-authored with daughter Jenna.

Laura Bush donated all net proceeds from the advance to Teach for America and the New Teacher Project, the White House statement said.

Cheney's income included his government salary of $212, 208 and a pension of $32,500 from Union Pacific Corporation, of which he is a former director.

His wife, Lynne, earned a salary from the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, and reported book royalty income and a pension of $32,000 from Reader's Digest, of which she formerly was a director.

She listed her occupation as "writer." Cheney listed his as "vice president."

The Cheneys donated $166,547 to charity last year, the White House said, bringing their total charitable contributions during his vice presidency to just under $8 million. E-mail to a friend
