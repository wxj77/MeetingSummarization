(CNN) -- "Even if I could physically do it ... I wouldn't want to go onto another Games because this has been as good as it can get at an Olympics," says Chris Hoy, Britain's champion cyclist.

The 36-year-old Scot, who picked up two gold medals at London 2012, says the home support has been incredible and couldn't be replicated in Rio.

"The only thing I'd like to continue on to is the Commonwealth Games in two year's time because that will be another home Games in Glasgow and the perfect way to end my career," he said.

Hoy completed his Olympic odyssey with victory in the Keirin on the final day of competition in the velodrome last Tuesday -- a win which preceded an emotional medal ceremony.

"The night before I was watching Felix Sanchez get his medal in the 400m hurdles. I've never met the guy, but just seeing the raw emotion, the sheer delight and release ... I was welling up myself. So I think I knew when I got up there (on the podium) that it was going to be emotional moment for me," Hoy told CNN.

Hoy's tally of six gold medals sees him become Britain's most decorated Olympian, overhauling rower Steve Redgrave's total of five.

Since the competition finished in the velodrome, Hoy, the fastest man on two wheels, has had the chance to watch the fastest man on two legs, Usain Bolt.

"I was fortunate enough to see him in action (in the 200m final). I've seen him many times before on TV, but you never get an idea of just how impressive the performances are until you see them live," Hoy said.

Bolt, he says, is the face of the Games and an Olympic icon, but the Olympics isn't about just one person.

"It's about stories, individual stories -- whether it's defeat or success. Human stories, that's what makes the Games special," Hoy said.

"It's as much about these emotional moments as they are about the gold medal-winning athletes."
