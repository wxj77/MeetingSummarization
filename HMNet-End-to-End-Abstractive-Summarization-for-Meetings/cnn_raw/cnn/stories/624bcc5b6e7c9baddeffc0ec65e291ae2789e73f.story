This week marked the final voyage of the space shuttle and it was to a museum. The United States retired its space shuttles last year due to a lack of funding. Now, the private sector has stepped into space exploration. Virgin Galactic was one of the first and for a price tag of $200,000, you could be on your way to space. MME sits down with the man behind the out-of-this-world experience, George Whitesides.
