(CNN) -- President Barack Obama passed his recent physical in excellent condition, according to White House physician Dr. Jeff Kuhlman.

The physical -- the president's first since February 2010 -- was conducted last week. It included testing for colon and prostate cancer and diabetes -- all of which were negative -- as well as measures of blood pressure and vision. At 50 years of age, the president continues to have uncorrected 20/20 vision, according to Kuhlman's report.

Obama, who early in his administration categorized himself as "a former smoker" but conceded "there are times I mess up," was found to be "tobacco free," according to a two-page summary of Kuhlman's report released by the White House.

The report says that the president occasionally drinks alcohol in moderation, which has been linked to good heart health, and that he "eats a healthy diet."

Specifically, the report said Obama, who stands 6 feet 1 inch tall, "stays at a healthy weight" at 181.3 pounds. His blood pressure measured normal at 107/71 mm Hg and his heart rate was measured at 67 beats per minute.

Obama's cholesterol measures were categorized by Kuhlman as "'ideal' with a calculated 10-year coronary heart disease risk of low (2%)."

Kuhlman summarized that "the President is in excellent health and 'fit for duty.' All clinical data indicate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency."

Obama's next full physical will occur at the end of next year.
