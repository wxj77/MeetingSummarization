Moscow (CNN) -- A cargo train derailed Tuesday and crashed into a passenger train near Moscow, killing several passengers and wounding dozens, officials said.

The Russian Healthcare Ministry reported that six people died in the crash. State-run news agency ITAR-Tass said nine were killed, according to the Moldovan Ministry of Transport.

Of the 45 people injured in the crash, 18 were taken to hospitals, and five are in critical condition, ITAR-Tass reported.

The accident took place near Naro-Fominsk, southwest of Moscow, the Emergency Ministry told CNN.

Thirteen cars of the freight train derailed and crashed into a passenger train traveling from Moscow to Chisinau, "eventually overturning three of the train's cars with people inside," ITAR-Tass reported.

Rail traffic in and out of Moscow's southwest was suspended, the report said.

A total of 394 tickets were purchased for the passenger train, the Interior Ministry said.
