(EW.com) -- When Jacob (Anton Yelchin) meets Anna (Felicity Jones) in the exquisite, happy/sad young-love story "Like Crazy," it's only after Anna makes the first move. She's a spunky British visiting student at a Los Angeles university and an aspiring writer; he's a quiet American classmate and an aspiring furniture designer.

Doremus has said he developed "Like Crazy" based on his own experience with a long-term, long-distance relationship; he's attentive to the million little frustrations that can nibble away at even the most passionate commitment, moments pinpointed by the production's handheld camera work.

With no such narrative artifice, no Love Story-ish terminal illness or other tragedy to stimulate audience tear ducts, and none of the mood miseries or big-name lures of "Blue Valentine," "Like Crazy" tells the truth, simply: Love is thrilling. And -- just because of the way life happens -- sometimes love hurts. A-
