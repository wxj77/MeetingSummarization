(CNN) -- Paul McCartney is almost "Out There," again.

The former Beatle is on the road to recovery after falling ill during his "Out There" tour in Asia, where he was forced to postpone shows in Japan.

"Since contracting a virus last week that led to the postponement of tour dates, Paul received successful medical treatment at a hospital in Tokyo," according to a statement posted Thursday on his official website. "He'll make a complete recovery and has been ordered to take a few days rest."

Cancellations are rare for McCartney, who has proven an iron man while maintaining a global tour schedule over the past several years. He'll turn 72 in June.

McCartney plans to reschedule the shows at Tokyo's National Stadium, which were originally planned for May 18 and 19. Shows scheduled for May 21, at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan, and May 24, at Osaka's Yanmar Stadium Nagai, have also been postponed.

The musician was touched by the messages of support, according to his site.

"Paul has been extremely moved by all the messages and well wishes he has received from fans all over the world," the statement said.

McCartney is currently performing in support of his album "New," which was released in October. His tour is scheduled to continue in Seoul, South Korea, on May 28, before coming to the United States on June 14.
