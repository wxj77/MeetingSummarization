(CNN) -- "Curly Sue" actress Alisan Porter has an admission to make: "Hi, I'm Ali, and I'm an alcoholic."

That's how Porter begins a blog post on her website, "Lil Mamas," where the now-33-year-old details her battle with alcoholism.

In the post, titled "The Obligatory Child Star Gets Sober Mom Blog," Porter kids that perhaps her fans "didn't see that one coming. Or, because you know that I'm a former child star, you totally did."

Porter, who's best remembered as Jim Belushi's young co-star in the 1991 John Hughes comedy, describes the moment when she recognized she needed to change.

"I was living in NYC," she recalls. "I was miserable and overwhelmed with life. I was heartbroken and realizing that what had always worked for me in the past was NOT working at all ... So, I did what every good user does and I prayed to a god I had never believed in... and then called my mom. Days later I was off to treatment, just like that. For the next four years I went to meetings, worked the steps, got a sponsor, found a god of my own understanding, prayed, meditated and basically grew up."

Porter can now say that she's been sober since October 28, 2007. As a married mom of two, the former actress admits she still has her bad days, but she says her family helps her keep things in perspective.

"I don't drink because I don't want to miss one second of the responsibilities I get to have today. I don't drink because I can't. I want to, a lot of days, because I'm human and because life gets hard. But I don't," Porter writes. "I'm sure that someday my kids will ask me why I don't drink and my answer will be simple: 'I never want to lose myself and not be able to find you.'"
