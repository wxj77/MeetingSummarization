(CNN) -- Internet media giant Yahoo! has secured exclusive rights to publish online highlights of the English Premier League until 2013.

The content will be provided to British-based consumers only, from the start of the 2010/11 season in August.

The move adds to the basketball (NBA), golf (PGA), ice hockey (NHL) and baseball (MLB) action the company already supplies to its U.S. users.

The agreement will allow football fans access to five-minute highlights of every Premier League game via its Web site.

Yahoo's European managing director Rich Riley claimed the deal shows their intent to supply high-quality sport action.

"The acquisition of Premier League rights shows how serious Yahoo! is about providing the best in video content," said Riley.

"Sport is a passion for our target audiences and the Premier League rights are a key part of our efforts to build on Yahoo's reputation for engaging, original content."

Sport Industry Group's Drew Barrand told CNN the announcement underlines a wider trend of sport broadcasting increasingly finding a home on digital platforms.

"In the world that we live in, there is less time to watch television in its traditional format," said Barrand.

"Mobile rights and online rights are very much the future in how the consumer will interact with sport [broadcasts]. Every outlet will need to react to that and change their strategy accordingly."

In an official statement sent to CNN, Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore acknowledged the significance of online highlights.

"The way fans access Barclays Premier League action is growing ever more diverse and sophisticated," explained Scudamore.

"The online highlights package is an important medium for supporters of all our clubs to be able to follow match action."
