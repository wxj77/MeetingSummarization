(CNN) -- Deluxe lodgings in Lhasa.

A canyon-side retreat on the outskirts of Muscat.

A private island in Doha.

Sparkly hotels opening around the world in 2014 come with features just as cool as their settings.

Luxury bathroom products and pillow menus are no longer enough.

Today's travelers now demand (at least someone thinks) such extras as a marine conservation center, private cinema, oxygen lounge and in-room thermal baths.
