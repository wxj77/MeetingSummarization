(CNN) -- At last -- the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations has a home.

Equatorial Guinea will host Africa's top football tournament between January 17 and February 18 after striking a deal to replace Morocco.

CAF, the Confederation of African Football, announced the decision on Friday following Morocco's refusal to host the tournament.

Morocco had cited fears over Ebola, the deadly disease sweeping across parts of Africa, as the reason to postpone the event until 2016.

CAF rejected that proposition and expelled Morocco following its refusal to host the competition.

It signals a remarkable turnaround in Equatorial Guinea's fortunes following the team's suspension from the competition for fielding an ineligible player earlier this year.

During qualifying for the 2012 World Cup, Equatorial Guinea forfeited two games for the same offense.
