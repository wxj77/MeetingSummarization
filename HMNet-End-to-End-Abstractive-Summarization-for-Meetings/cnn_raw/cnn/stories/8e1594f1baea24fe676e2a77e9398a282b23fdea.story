(CNN) -- May the Feathers be with you.

In their relentless quest to exhaust the galaxy of new marketing opportunities, "Angry Birds" has partnered with Lucasfilm for a "Star Wars"-themed version of the blockbuster mobile game. The new game launches Thursday on most major platforms: iOS, Android, Amazon Kindle Fire, Mac, PC, Windows Phone, and Windows 8.

To quote from Rovio Entertainment's press release, the game follows "a plucky group of Rebel birds in their fight against the evil Imperial Pigs." Players will get to "use the Force, wield a Lightsaber, and blast away Pigtroopers on an intergalactic journey from the deserts of Tatooine to the depths of the Pig Star."

"Angry Birds Star Wars" features more than 80 levels. Successful players will eventually face off against a porcine version of Darth Vader.

The game is the fifth major installment of the "Angry Birds" franchise, which has racked up more than 1 billion downloads since launching in 2009.

What's so addictive about 'Angry Birds'?

Perhaps this cross-promotional marriage of entertainment behemoths was inevitable. Rovio's "Angry Birds" has spawned board games, books, toys and soda pop, while "Star Wars" has lent its name to everything from comic books and Legos to snowboards and umbrellas.

You won't be shocked to hear that "Angry Birds Star Wars" merchandise is already for sale in retailers worldwide.
