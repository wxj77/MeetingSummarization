(CNN) -- A ferry crammed with people capsized late Friday night in Bangladesh, killing at least 28 passengers, police said.

The boat had a capacity of 1,500, but was overcrowded with about 2,000 people, said Nazrul Islam, the police chief of Bangladesh's southern Bhola district. They were traveling from the capital, Dhaka, to their homes in Bhola for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha.

The boat toppled as passengers weighted down one side to disembark, Islam said.

The dead included eight women and 15 children. About 50 more people were injured.

Police and firefighters rushed to aid passengers, many of whom were trapped in the lower deck. The number of people missing remained unclear and rescue teams feared the death toll would rise.

CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.
