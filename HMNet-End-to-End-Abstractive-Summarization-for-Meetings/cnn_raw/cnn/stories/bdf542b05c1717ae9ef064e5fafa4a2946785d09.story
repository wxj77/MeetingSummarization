We're truly international in scope on Tuesday. We're visiting Italy, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Himalayan Mountains. Find out who's attempting to circumnavigate the globe in a plane powered partially by the sun, and explore the mysterious appearance of craters in northern Asia. You'll also get a view of Mount Everest that was previously reserved for climbers.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
