(EW.com) -- Oprah has done it again: EW can exclusively report the entertainment mogul has landed Lindsay Lohan for an exclusive sit-down after the actress emerges from rehab later this summer.

Moreover: Oprah Winfrey's OWN cable network has signed Lohan to an eight-episode docu-series that will follow the actress as she works to rebuild her career and stay healthy. The interview will tape and air in August, with the series to air in 2014.

"OWN will air an exclusive interview with Oprah and Lindsay Lohan that will tape and air in August and an eight-part documentary series with Lindsay for 2014," an OWN spokesperson confirmed.

The 27-year-old Lohan is currently serving a 90-day court-ordered stint in a rehabilitation facility that is expected to conclude on July 31. Getting her first post-rehab interview is considered a big scoop, while the series is arguably even bigger â€” Lohan has turned down unscripted project offers for years, preferring to focus on scripted acting roles (though her family participated in an E! docu-series titled Living Lohan in 2008). Lohan recently had guest-star appearances on Fox's Glee and FX's Anger Management, as well as starred as Elizabeth Taylor in Lifetime's biopic Liz & Dick. She also co-stars in Paul Schrader's upcoming film The Canyons.

Over the last year on her Oprah's Next Chapter program, Oprah has scored a string of coveted celebrity interviews, including Lance Armstrong's doping-admission interview, Rihanna talking about her turbulent relationship with Chris Brown and an interview with Whitney Houston's family after the singer's death. Her network, which got off to a rocky ratings start, is coming off its strongest quarter yet, up 32 percent from the first quarter.
