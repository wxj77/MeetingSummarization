(Real Simple)  -- Radio City Music Hall's Rockettes tell how to find the very best hosiery, from opaques to wintry woolens: a true stocking feat

Best Regular Black Tights

Wolford, $42 -- A bit costlier than others, it's true, but the luxurious material is featherlight while still providing dense coverage. What's more, said one dancer, "I tugged and tugged, and no runs."

Style: Satin Opaque 50.

To Buy: Wolford, 800-965-3673 for locations.

Best Regular Color Tights

Berkshire Legwear, $9 -- Offered in a range of rich, vibrant shades that are surprisingly wearable and flattering, these tights are a fuss-free way to punch up a neutral dress. One tester said they gave her legs that "smooth, after-you-shave feeling."  Real Simple: DYI wardrobe fixes

Style: 3670 Lola in Opaque.

To Buy: www.essentialapparel.com.

Best Regular Patterned Tights

DKNY, $18 -- A pattern on legs can be tricky to pull off, but these argyles manage to look both sophisticated and fun. Plus, "they really held up to my abuse," noted a Rockette.

Style: 0A830 Argyle Panel.

To Buy: Nordstrom, 888-282-6060.

Best Control Top Black Tights

Berkshire Legwear, $8 -- The subtle, dressy shimmer makes legs look shapely and long, while a dose of spandex works to "keep the jiggle away," said a tester. Real Simple: Best boots

Style: 4643 Shimmers Opaque.

To Buy: www.essentialapparel.com.

Best Control Top Color Tights

Hue, $11 -- This slimming pair offers a comfortable fit -- no binding waistband here -- in a rainbow palette. "The color stayed opaque even when stretched out," noted a dancer.

Style: 6620 Opaque Control Top.

To Buy: www.hue.com.

Best Control Top Patterned Tights

Spanx, $28 -- The secret weapon behind dozens of slinky Oscar dresses trims the midsection, the thighs, and the rear, causing one Rockette to declare, "I feel a size smaller." A unique diamond print showcases legs.

Style: Tight-End Diamond Pattern.

To Buy: www.bloomingdales.com.

Best Sweater Black Tights

Donna Karan, $30 -- A dancer singled out the "nice elasticity" of these unexpectedly thin but warm wool tights, which resisted bagging and buckling.

Style: 0A851 Tarnished Wool.

To Buy: Nordstrom, 888-282-6060.

Best Sweater Color Tights

Hue, $18 -- Made of a soft cotton blend, this hose isn't "scratchy at all," unlike many other knits. An earthy brown heather makes them a natural match for nubby tweeds and wools. Real Simple: Bras for every figure

Style: 3063 Marled Sweater.

To Buy: Nordstrom, 888-282-6060.

Best Sweater Patterned Tights

Via Spiga, $24 -- The cozy cable-knit texture has an old-fashioned feel, while the cotton-blend tights' gray shade will complement a variety of outfits. "I can't wait to wear these in chilly weather," a tester said.

Style: Cable Sweater Knit.

To Buy: Bloomingdale's, 866-593-2540 for locations.

Best Black Leggings

Capezio, $24 -- Not surprisingly, the Rockettes are fans of this dance-world staple. The leggings feel like "a second skin," one tester said, and they kept their shape impeccably, even after a rigorous dance routine.

Style: 9479 Lowrise Ankle Legging.

To Buy: www.capeziodance.com.

Best Color Leggings

American Apparel, $26 -- These "comfy, easy-to-wear" leggings come in 27 neutral, bright, and jewel tones -- including forest, asphalt, eggplant, and raspberry -- plus three cute polka-dot prints.

Style: 8328 Cotton Spandex Jersey Legging.
