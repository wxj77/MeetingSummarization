(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso has warned his rivals for the Formula One drivers' championship he is hitting peak form after his stunning victory at the Singapore Grand Prix.

The Ferrari driver led from start to finish in Singapore to record his third victory in the last five races and put him firmly in contention for the title.

Alonso moved into second in the standings after Sunday's race, just 11 points behind current leader Mark Webber, of Red Bull, and he says he is operating at his optimum level.

"We are in a sport where you cannot be completely fit, focused and motivated 100 per cent at every race, every month. You are up and down," Alonso was quoted as saying by the UK Press Association.

"But right now, at this point of the championship, I'm at a peak -- 100 per cent motivated, focused etc."

The Spaniard has now leapfrogged McLaren pair Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, as well as Webber's Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel with just four races remaining.

And heading into the next race in Japan, Alonso insists he is in good shape as the nine-month long season threatens to offer up a thrilling climax.

He added: "Sometimes in past championships in September, I was getting tired, what with all these long flights, getting very stressed.

"But this year it is different. It feels like the championship is starting now, so I feel very happy we will be going to Japan next race."

Meanwhile, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has predicted that the championship will be decided during the final race in Abu Dhabi.

"I think it is almost inevitable with the way the season has swung backwards and forwards that this will go right down to the wire in Abu Dhabi," Horner was quoted as saying by the UK Press Association.

"I sincerely hope it doesn't and I sincerely hope it is one of our guys who ties it up before that. But the likelihood is that with the quality of drivers and teams involved that it will go down to the wire."
