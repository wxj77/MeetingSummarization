Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- All U.S. forces have vacated a military base in Pakistan, meeting a deadline set by Islamabad after a NATO airstrike killed dozens of soldiers, local military officials said Sunday.

Pakistan requested U.S. forces to vacate the Shamsi Airbase by December 11 in response to the November 26th attack that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in the northwest of the country.

Fifty-one American personnel have left the air base, taking drone planes and other equipment with them, according to the Pakistani military officials. They did not want to be named because they are not authorized to talk to the media.

Pakistan military has taken over the base, the officials said.

Shamsi Airbase was one of two bases Pakistan provided the U.S. for their operations in the region.

It was built in 1992 by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the then ruler of the United Arab Emirates.
