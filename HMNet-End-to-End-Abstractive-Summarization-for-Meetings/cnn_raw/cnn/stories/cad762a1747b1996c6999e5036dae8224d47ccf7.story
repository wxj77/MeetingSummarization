(CNN)  -- A man suspected of killing five members of his family and wounding another on Thursday committed suicide after police surrounded him in a house, police in Cleveland, Ohio, said Friday.

Police say Davon Crawford, 33, killed his new wife, her sister and three children.

Acting on a tip, police surrounded the house and then entered it after seeing a man who matched the description of suspect Davon Crawford briefly step outside, police spokesman Lt. Thomas Stacho said.

"They confronted the male hiding in a bathroom," Stacho said. "When he spotted the agents, then he took his own life."

Cleveland police launched a manhunt Thursday for Crawford, 33, suspected of killing his new wife, Lechea Crawford, 30; her sister, Rose Stevens, 25; and three of Stevens' children, Destiny Woods, 5, and 2-year-old twins Dion and Davion Primm.

A 7-year-old boy was shot and hospitalized, Julie Short, a spokeswoman for MetroHealth Medical Center, said Friday. The boy's grandfather told CNN affiliate WEWS that the boy was in stable condition and talking after having been shot in the shoulder.

A fourth child, a 12-year-old boy, managed to escape, WKYC reported.

The Cleveland Plain Dealer also reported that a 2-month-old girl, the daughter of Davon and Lechea Crawford, escaped the shooting unharmed and is being cared for.

Police began searching for Crawford, 33, Thursday night after receiving a call around 8 p.m. to the upper floor of a duplex.

"It looks like it was some type of domestic argument that sparked this tragedy," Police Chief Michael McGrath said Friday.
