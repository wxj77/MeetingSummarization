The costume was designed by three-time Oscar-winner Colleen Atwood, who also served in the same capacity for WBTV/The CW's DC takes 'Arrow" and "The Flash."

"In designing Supergirl, I wanted to embrace the past but more importantly, thrust her into the street-style action hero of today," said Atwood, who earned Oscars for "Into the Woods," "Snow White and the Huntsman" and "Sweeney Todd."

Production on the pilot started this week in Los Angeles.

The drama centers on Kara Zor-El (Benoist), Superman's cousin, who was born on the planet Krypton and escaped amid its destruction years ago. After arriving on Earth, Kara was taken in by a foster family, the Danverses, who taught her to be careful with her extraordinary powers (which she shares with her famous cousin).

"Brothers & Sisters" and "Ally McBeal" alum Calista Flockhart co-stars as DC Comics character Cat Grant, "True Blood's" Mehcad Brooks is set as Jimmy Olsen; "Homeland's" David Harewood is DC Comics character Hank Henshaw; and "Grey's Anatomy's" Chyler Leigh plays Alexandra "Alex" Danvers, the confident foster sister of Kara. Laura Benanti will recur, while former Supergirl Helen Slater and former Superman Dean Cain will guest-star in the pilot.

"Arrow" and "Flash's" Greg Berlanti and his "No Ordinary Family" cohort Ali Adler ("The New Normal") as well as "Arrow" and "Flash" EP Andrew Kreisberg will pen the script and executive produce the drama via Berlanti Productions' Warner Bros. Television-based banner. Berlanti Productions' topper Sarah Schechter also is on board to executive produce.
