(CNN) -- A surrogate mother gave birth to twin girls for Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, a publicist for the couple said.

Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick are the new parents of twin daughters.

"The babies are doing beautifully, and the entire family is over the moon," the publicist said, adding that the girls were born Monday afternoon.

The couple, married for 12 years, revealed in April that they were expecting twins "with the generous help of a surrogate."

It was not said whether the surrogate was the genetic mother of the twins or whether embryos from Parker, 44, had been transferred to her.

"Marion Loretta Elwell Broderick weighed five pounds, 11 ounces and Tabitha Hodge Broderick weighed six pounds," the publicist said. "Both Hodge and Elwell are family names on Parker's side."

Parker is best known for the popular television series and movie "Sex and the City," while Broderick gained fame as the main character in the movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off."

They have a son, James Wilkie, 6. He was named after Broderick's father, actor James Broderick.
