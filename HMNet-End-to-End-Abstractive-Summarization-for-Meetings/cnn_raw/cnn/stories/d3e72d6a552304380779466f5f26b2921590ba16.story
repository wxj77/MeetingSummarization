(CNN) -- Zaha Hadid's spaceship-like Dongdaemun Design Plaza, an avant-garde new home for Singapore's oldest Buddhist Temple, and a private bunker sprawling on top of a lake are some of the shortlisted entries competing for architectural honors at the World Architecture Festival in Singapore this week.

Now it its seventh year, the event is the world's biggest celebration of building design.

Hundreds of firms from more than 50 countries will be presenting and competing across 27 categories (Hotel and Leisure, Education and Display, others) in the three-day event.

Winners in each category will compete for the grand prizes -- World Building of the Year and Future Project of the Year.

Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tamaki, designed by Francis-Jones Morehen Thorp, was the Building of the Year in 2013.

Future Project of the Year 2013 went to the National Maritime Museum of China, designed by Australia-based Cox Rayner Architects.

Two new awards have been added to this year's program.

The Exterior Color Prize recognizes creative use of color, while the Wood Excellence Prize awards the most exceptional timber project.

A surge in entries from Asia marks this year's event.

In addition to its prestigious award ceremony, the World Architecture Festival hosts conferences and lectures.
