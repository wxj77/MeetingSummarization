(CNN) -- Three people were taken to a hospital and others were treated at an airport after an Aruba-to-Miami flight encountered turbulence while making its initial descent into Miami, an American Airlines spokesman said.

The incident occurred Tuesday night aboard Flight 1780, about 30 minutes before it landed at 6:06 p.m., Matt Miller said.

Two flight attendants and one passenger were taken to a hospital, where they were treated and released, and a handful of other passengers received medical attention at the Miami airport, Miller said.

"It appears that we had approximately 12 patients," said Michelle Fayed, a spokeswoman for Miami-Dade Fire.

The turbulence lasted about 15 seconds, Miller said. The Boeing 757's seat belt sign was on at the time, and nothing on radar showed turbulence was in the area.

The flight left Aruba at 3:30 p.m., carrying 185 passengers and a crew of six, Miller said.
