(CNN) -- A Massachusetts husband and wife were each sentenced to prison Monday after being found guilty last month of raping their two adopted children.

Joseph Mayotte, 50, sexually abused his daughter over a five-year span, starting when she was 8, according to a news release from prosecutor Joseph D. Early Jr.

Mayotte was convicted in August on 11 charges -- including rape of a child aggravated by age difference -- and was sentenced Monday to 16 to 20 years in prison.

His wife, Linda Mayotte, was convicted on 19 charges -- including three counts of rape of a child -- and sentenced from 18 to 22 years behind bars.

The 49-year-old became pregnant with her adopted son's child when he was only 15, according to Paul Jarvey of the Worcester County District Attorney's Office. It was a pregnancy she carried to term, Jarvey said.

"Let them burn in hell," is what the son, now 21, said of his former parents in an impact statement read in court today, according to Jarvey.

The Mayottes, who lived in the central Massachusetts town of Northbridge, were arrested in 2009. The two adopted children -- along with the child to whom Linda Mayotte gave birth -- were adopted by other families.

"Their trust was broken by these two predators," Early's statement said. "Now, justice has been served."
