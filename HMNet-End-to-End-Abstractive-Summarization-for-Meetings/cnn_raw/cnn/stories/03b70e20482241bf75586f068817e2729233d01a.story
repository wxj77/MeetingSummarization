(CNN) -- For many people, just a minor surgery can be nerve-wracking. But Dr. Deborah Cohan went into her double mastectomy operation with courage and dance moves.

On Tuesday, Cohan, an OB-GYN and a mother of two, went into surgery to have her breasts removed. But before the surgery, she and her medical team threw a pre-op dance party in the operating room at the University of California-San Francisco Medical Center at Mount Zion.

The dance video was posted on YouTube on Tuesday and has soared in views, getting attention from more than 250,000 viewers. Commenters on the YouTube page praised Cohan for her courage and joy.

In the six-minute video, Cohan and her team dance to Beyonce's hit single "Get Me Bodied." Cohan really shows off her dance moves, shaking and grooving in her surgical gown. The dance party was actually orchestrated by Cohan herself, and posted on CaringBridge, a site that connects friends and family together during a health event. On the site, Cohan created a page called Deborah's Healing Journey, where she detailed her flash mob plans.

"My fantasy is for you to play the song ... and dance wherever you happen to be," Cohan wrote on her CaringBridge site. She also requested friends and family to send photos and videos of themselves dancing to the song.

"I have visions of a healing video montage. Nothing brings me greater joy than catalyzing others to dance, move, be in their bodies. Are you with me people?"

The UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion says Cohan was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday.
