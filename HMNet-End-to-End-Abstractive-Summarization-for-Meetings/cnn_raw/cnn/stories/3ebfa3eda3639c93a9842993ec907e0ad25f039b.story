(CNN) -- Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who resigned because of an extramarital affair with Maria Belen Chapur, told CNN in an interview Wednesday he was "completely" surprised when Chapur -- now his fiancee -- showed up the night before to appear with him when he claimed victory in the runoff for the GOP nomination for his old U.S. House seat.

"I round the corner and there she is to give me a hug and surprise me," Sanford said on "The Lead with Jake Tapper" the day after his comeback political victory. "It was not at all what I expected. It was an awfully, awfully nice surprise."

Chapur has rarely been seen in public with Sanford after the scandal of the affair, which was revealed after Sanford lied about hiking on the Appalachian Trail while he traveled to Argentina to visit her.

He ended up getting divorced, and his victory in Tuesday's runoff vote was a the first step in a political comeback.
