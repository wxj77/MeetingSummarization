(CNN) -- Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam has been elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association, replacing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Susana Martinez of New Mexico will serve as vice chairman.

The decision was announced over Twitter during the party's three-day annual conference in Boca Raton, Florida.

Unlike his predecessor, Haslam is known for his drama-free leadership style, and has been described as soft-spoken and mild-mannered.

The Tennessee businessman, sports team owner, and former Knoxville mayor was re-elected to his second term as governor in November.

Looking ahead, Haslam will face a much smaller election in 2015 than Christie did this past year. Instead of overseeing 36 governor's races, Haslam will only have to fundraise and campaign for three: in Kentucky, Mississippi and Louisiana.

In a statement, Christie praised Haslam as a "true pioneer."

"Gov. Haslam is doing what governors are elected to do," Christie said. "He has the results to prove it. His guidance will be a tremendous asset to this organization in the coming year."

Haslam's Democratic counterpart will be elected next month at the Democratic Governors Association annual meeting in Los Angeles.
