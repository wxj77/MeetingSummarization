Davos (CNN) -- Selfie is the word du jour, and it became cause celebre at Nelson Mandela's funeral when the Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt took a selfie with U.S. President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron.

But there is no easy way to ask serious-minded men and women who hold high office, and who have matters of state on their mind, "do you mind if I take a quick selfie?"

To be sure, they know what it is and may even have engaged in selfie-ing themselves. But in the grand world of Davos, it is perhaps unseemly to be seen taking selfies.

Which is why I decided the selfie challenge was such a good idea. Who would and who would not agree to the selfie?

Out of consideration for their feelings I am not revealing who refused. Nor will I show you the selfie of the central banker that is best left in my iPhone.

No, what is here are the good and the great that said yes. And to be honest, most seem to enjoy it anyway.
