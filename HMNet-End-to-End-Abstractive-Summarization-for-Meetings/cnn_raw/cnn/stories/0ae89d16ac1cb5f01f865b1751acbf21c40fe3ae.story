When Twitter asks "What are you doing," maybe you should be following tweets on job advice.

When microblogging and social networking site Twitter debuted three years ago, plenty of people wrote it off as yet another pointless addition in the overcrowded networking world.

Considering the site only allows people to post, or Tweet, messages of 140 characters or less, you can't blame early skeptics.

But little by little, users proved the site's worth to nonbelievers. Last year, student James Karl Buck was traveling in Egypt and wound up in jail. He Tweeted "arrested" to notify his friends of what was going on and ultimately get out of jail.

During the 2008 presidential election, candidates reached out to voters using the service. When a plane crashed into the Hudson River in January, a Twitter user posted the first photograph from the scene.

Although we're in the nascent stage of Twitter's existence and therefore have no idea how long it will be around, we do know it has more growing to do.

If you're not yet certain you want to start posting your own daily activities for everyone to read, you can still use the service as a resource for tips on finding a job and keeping up with industry news. Job seekers can follow people who will make your job search process easier, from the interviewing stage to the salary negotiations.

I follow many people whom I think give great advice, post informative articles and know what they're talking about. Seeing as the Twitter feed refreshes constantly so that I see new posts instantly, it's like having a scrolling news ticker about only the subjects I want to read. I suggest you do the same to improve your job search.

Here are the 10 job Tweeters you should be following.
