(CNN) -- A Texas man has been arrested in connection with a slaying in Pennsylvania 45 years ago.

Richard Keiper, 67, of Boyd, Texas, was taken into custody by Pennsylvania State Police and Texas Rangers on Thursday, two days shy of the 45th anniversary of Alfred Barnes' death, a state police news release said.

Keiper will face murder, robbery and theft charges, the release said.

Barnes was shot multiple times and his body was found in a field in Chestnuthill Township in Monroe Country, the release said. Barnes' car was missing from the scene and later was recovered in Warren Country, New Jersey, it said.

Senior couple charged in decades old cold cases

Barnes, an employee at now-closed Bethlehem Steel Corp. in Pennsylvania, was 40 years old at the time of his death.

Keiper, who was 22 at the time, is currently at the Wise County jail in Texas, Sgt. Daniel Armstrong said. He will probably be extradited to Pennsylvania to face charges, Dave Peters, public information officer for the Pennsylvania State Police, told CNN.

CNN attempts to get comment from Keiper or a representative went unanswered.
