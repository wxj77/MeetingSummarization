Bulawayo, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai on Sunday urged his supporters to prepare for an election he hoped regional leaders would monitor to ensure a credible result to help end the troubled coalition government.

"Our brothers in SADC have been supportive of our endeavor toward democratizing Zimbabwe," he said.

"We hope SADC (Southern African Development Community) and the AU will continue to support our efforts to reject attempts to manipulate the will of the people and remain resolute in their approach in dealing with the Zimbabwe issue."

Tsvangirai's comments came at the end of his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) congress in Bulawayo, southwest of the capital, Harare.

The prime minister said he was confident he would win the next election to end the power-sharing deal he entered with President Robert Mugabe, adding that his main task would be to revive Zimbabwe's economy.

Mugabe wants the elections held this year, but Tsvangirai has demanded reforms first.

Last week, the prime minister said elections would be held in 12 months.

Tsvangirai and Mugabe formed a power-sharing government in 2009 after postelection violence following Mugabe's victory claim.

The fragile coalition government has been marred by disagreements between the former political foes, with Tsvangirai claiming that Mugabe is reluctant to make Zimbabwe a democracy.
