(CNN) -- Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked a Democrat-backed bill that would have extended tax cuts to small businesses.

Both sides indicated the vote was political one -- Democrats said Republicans blocked the bill to cost President Barack Obama political points. Republicans said that the legislation was a campaign stunt and wasn't enough to have any impact on jump-starting the economy.

By the numbers, here's a look at small business in America:
