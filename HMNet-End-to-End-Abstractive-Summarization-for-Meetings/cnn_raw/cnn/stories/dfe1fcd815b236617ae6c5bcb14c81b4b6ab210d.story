(CNN) -- Jennifer Love Hewitt is taking on motherhood for her next role.

The 34-year-old actress revealed Tuesday that she's expecting her first child with "Client List" co-star Brian Hallisay, 34. The impending arrival will be Hallisay's first child as well.

"This is a wonderful time, and we are looking forward to starting our family together," the couple said in a statement.

According to Us Weekly, Hallisay and Hewitt have been dating for 15 months. The two also play a couple on Lifetime's "The Client List," albeit one with some serious marital issues.

Hewitt is also executive producer of the show, in which she plays a struggling single mom who hands out more than massages at a seemingly legitimate day spa. Hallisay portrays Hewitt's on-screen estranged husband.

Based on Lifetime's 2010 movie of the same name, the series started its second season on the network in March.
