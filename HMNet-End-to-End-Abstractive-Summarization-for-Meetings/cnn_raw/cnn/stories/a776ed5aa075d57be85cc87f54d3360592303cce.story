(CNN) -- Ned Vizzini, who shot to fame at a young age for his teenage novels focusing on youth depression and anxieties, has died.

In his books, Vizzini openly talked about his struggle with depression.

He died Thursday of blunt impact injuries to the head, torso and extremities. "The manner of death was suicide," the New York City medical examiner's office said. The office did not immediately say how Vizzini committed suicide.

Vizzini started writing for New York media at 15, and published his memoir, "Teen Angst? Naaah" at age 19.

The young author won accolades for his book, "It's Kind of a Funny Story," for its portrayal of teenage depression. His other novels included "Be More Chill" and "The Other Normals."

Amid his success, Vizzini continued to battle depression, which he openly discussed.

Shortly after "Be More Chill" was published to critical acclaim, Vizzini said, he checked himself into the New York Methodist Hospital for help with his depression.

"Through individual and group counseling, medication management, therapeutic activities on the unit, sincere care from the people who worked there, and some very eye-opening conversations with my fellow patients, I made it," he said in a statement on the hospital website.

After days at the hospital, he was discharged and got started on writing a book.

"This time, the book just flowed out of me," he said.

The end result was his 2006 hit, "It's Kind of a Funny Story." The book was adapted into a movie starring Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts four years later.

Vizzini also wrote for MTV's "Teen Wolf" and NBC's "Believe," according to his website.

He was 32. He is survived by his wife and son.
