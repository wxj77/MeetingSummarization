(CNN) -- It may have started as a TV debate about the Israel-Hamas conflict, but it's now turned into a seemingly endless online war of words between Russell Brand and Fox News anchor Sean Hannity.

The British comedian, actor and occasional political commentator branded Hannity a "terrorist" last week after the conservative U.S. pundit berated a Palestinian guest on his show during a heated debate over Israel's ongoing war with Hamas militants in Gaza -- a conflict that has claimed the lives of hundreds of Palestinians and dozens of Israelis in the past month.
