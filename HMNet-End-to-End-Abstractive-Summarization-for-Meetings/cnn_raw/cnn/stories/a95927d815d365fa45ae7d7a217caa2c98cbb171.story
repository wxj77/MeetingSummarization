(CNN) -- This month, IME hosts a special edition from Istanbul that looks at the role of women in the Middle East at a time when they are defying stereotypes as never before.

Fever pitch

Turkish football can no longer be claimed as a male preserve. IME visits the world famous Fenerbahce club as they attempt to confront crowd violence by banning men and permitting only female supporters to an early season game.

Acient Turkey's Queen Mothers

Also in Turkey, IME is granted rare TV access to the ancient harem at the Ottoman Topkapi Palace, taking a look back at some of the most famous Valide Sultans, or "Queen Mothers," who once wilded power at the Ottoman court and were patrons of architecture, leaving their mark on Istanbul's skyline.

Women's rights in Egypt

Rima Maktabi travels to Cairo to meet the renowned Egyptian author and feminist, Dr. Nawal Sadawi. Over the decades Sadawi has been imprisoned, censored, accused of blasphemy and faced numerous death threats. Now in her 80s, she remains a passionate activist and icon for women's rights.

Showcasing the art of Saudi women

Rima also visits an art gallery to meet Lulwah Al-Homoud and Princess Reem Al-Faisal, two outspoken Saudi female artists who find themselves as the unlikely leaders of an initiative showcasing Saudi talent to the outside world.

Rebuilding Iraq

In Iraq meanwhile, IME meets two Baghdadi women -- one a human rights activist and the other a blogger -- facing the challenges of trying to rebuild their shattered country whilst making sure the key decisions are not left solely to the men.
