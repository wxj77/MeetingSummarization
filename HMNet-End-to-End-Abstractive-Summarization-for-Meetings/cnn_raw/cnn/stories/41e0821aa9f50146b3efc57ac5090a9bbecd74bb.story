(CNN) -- Taylor Farms Pacific, Inc., a California-based food supplier for six retail chain stores, has announced the recall of grape tomatoes produced by a grower who said the vegetables might be contaminated with salmonella.

The recall applies to 29 brand-packaged salads sold at Albertson's, Raley's, Sam's Club, Savemart, Signature Cafe and Wal-Mart, the company said in a statement Monday. The affected products have expiration dates ranging from April 27 to May 9, according to the news release.

The recall applies to 13 states including Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, according to a spreadsheet attached to the news release.

Salmonella is a form of bacteria found in food that can cause serious illness and even death if ingested.

Taylor Farms has urged consumers not to eat these products and to return them to where they were purchased for full refunds.

Taylor Farms said customers with questions should call the company at 209-835-6300 or contact the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
