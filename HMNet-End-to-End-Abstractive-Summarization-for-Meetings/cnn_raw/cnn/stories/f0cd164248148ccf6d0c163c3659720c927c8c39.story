(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as champions Real Madrid secured their first win of the La Liga season with a 3-0 defeat of Granada in the Santiago Bernabeu Sunday.

The Portuguese star was making it 150 goals in just 149 games for the Madrid giants, but he limped off in the second half after a hefty challenge which saw Borja Gomez sent off for a second yellow card.

Real beat Barcelona to win the Spain Super Cup in midweek, but had taken a single point from their opening two league games.

Despite prompting from new signing Luka Modric from Tottenham, Real were uninspired in the opening half and Ronaldo owed his opener to a mistake by Antonio 'Tono' Rodriguez in the Granada goal as a shot from an acute angle squeezed through his legs on 25 minutes.

Real improved after the break and substitute Angel Di Maria set up Ronaldo for his second, his initial shot saved by Tono before knocking in the rebound.

Gonzalo Higuain, who came on for Ronaldo, scored the third after good work by Karim Benzema.

In the late evening kick off, Barcelona saw off Valencia 1-0 in the Camp Nou for their third straight win.

A blistering shot from Adriano put Barca ahead after 23 minutes of the first half, but they were unable to press home their advantage, with Cesc Fabregas wasting a great chance after being put through.

They had to survive some nervous moments in the last few minutes as home goalkeeper Victor Valdes was called into action.

In other matches Sunday, Rayo Vallecano drew 0-0 with Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao saw off Valladolid 2-0.

Levante came from behind to beat Espanyol 3-2 with an injury time winner.
