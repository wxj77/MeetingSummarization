(InStyle.com) -- New York City restaurateur Donatella Arpaia shows how to cook flawless pasta, how to pair it with the ideal sauce, and even the secret to boiling water (yes, there's a right way!)

Donatella Arpaia gives her bucatini the taste test.

Pasta 101

• Always buy 100 percent durum-wheat pasta made in Italy (De Cecco is a good supermarket brand).

• Cook pasta in a two gallon stockpot. Bring water (a gallon for every pound) to a rolling boil, then add two tablespoons of salt per gallon. Never add oil, which prevents sauce from adhering to pasta. When water returns to a boil, add pasta. Stir often to prevent sticking.

• A minute before the package time indicates, take out a piece of pasta and bite it. As soon as it's a uniform, translucent color, drain (but never rinse), add sauce and serve.

Sauce secrets

• Marry the sauce to its pasta: When pasta is just shy of done, add it to the pan of sauce. Toss over high heat for 2 minutes (add a little reserved pasta water if sauce is too thick).

• If you are using cheese in your dish, mix in a couple tablespoons with drained pasta first; it makes the pasta stickier so sauce clings to it.

• Don't over-sauce pasta. Use it as a condiment, with just enough to cover each strand.

• Use the right pasta shapes: Flat (like fettucine) with creamy sauces; long, thin (spaghetti, linguine) with seafood sauces; holes or ridges (rigatoni) or molded (farfalle) with chunky sauces; very thin (angel hair) with light sauces; thick and tubular (ziti) for baked dishes.

Must-haves

Arpaia gives the secrets to making pasta at home taste as delicious as at her restaurants:

1. Fresh rosemary smells great and is handy to snip into a dish.

2. Present pasta beautifully in a ceramic bowl.

3. Add Italian sea-salt tablet to boiling water.

4. A must: sleek stainless spaghetti tongs that effortlessly hold pasta.

5. Arpaia's easy pasta enhancements: arrabiata sauce, black truffle oil and anchovy oil.

6. Opt for handcrafted pasta.
