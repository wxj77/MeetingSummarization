A U.S. airstrike has killed the head of intelligence and security for the Al-Shabaab terrorist organization in Somalia, Tahlil Abdishakur, the Pentagon said Wednesday.

Unmanned aircraft fired Hellfire missiles at a vehicle carrying him near Saakow, in southern Somalia, the Pentagon said in a statement.

"His death will significantly impact Al-Shabaab's ability to conduct attacks against the government of the Federal Republic of Somalia, the Somali people, and U.S. allies and interests in the region," the statement said.

The United States designated Al-Shabaab as a terrorist organization in 2008. It has blamed the group for deadly bombings and other attacks that have killed scores of people.

A U.S. strike killed Ahmed Godane, co-founder of Al-Shabaab, a few months ago, the Pentagon has said.
