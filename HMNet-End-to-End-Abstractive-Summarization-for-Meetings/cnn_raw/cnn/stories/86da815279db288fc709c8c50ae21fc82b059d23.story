(CNN) -- Barcelona battled into the quarterfinals of the Copa Del Rey on Wednesday night as veteran French defender Eric Abidal scored his first goal for the Spanish champions in a 1-1 draw at Athletic Bilbao.

Pep Guardiola's team set up a clash with either La Liga rivals Getafe or second division Real Betis after winning on away goals following the 0-0 draw at the Camp Nou last month.

The 31-year-old Abidal, who was brought on as a second-half substitute, netted only the second goal of his career in the 75th minute to leave Bilbao needing two goals to go through.

The left-back sidefooted home after Xavi marked his record-breaking 550th appearance for Barcelona with a trademark pass to the feet of the recalled Lionel Messi, who guided the ball into Abidal's path.

The Basques threatened to take the match into extra-time when Spain striker Fernando Llorente continued his fine scoring run with an 85th-minute equalizer, but Barcelona held on.

"When I get a chance like that, I shoot. Now I hope to score more this season," Abidal told AFP.

Defending champions Sevilla cruised into the last eight with an 8-3 aggregate victory over La Liga rivals Malaga, winning 3-0 in the away leg.

Ivory Coast midfielder Ndri Romaric scored the opener with a deflected freekick six minutes after halftime, then substitute Diego Perotti made it 2-0 before Malaga defender Weligton was sent off for a second booking and Brazil striker Luis Fabiano netted late with another setpiece.

Sevilla will next play either Villarreal or Valencia, who meet on Thursday following a 0-0 first-leg draw.

Top-flight team Deportivo La Coruna needed extra-time before ending the hopes of second division Cordoba as Adrian scored a hat-trick in a 3-1 win.

The Spain under-21 international's treble ultimately gave the Galicians a 4-2 aggregate victory, but he needed to convert a penalty late in regulation time to stop his side crashing out after David Arteaga struck in the 86th minute.

Cordoba collapsed after Miguel Angel Tena was sent off in extra-time as Deportivo set up a clash with either Mallorca or Almeria, who lead 4-3.

Real Madrid also play on Thursday, holding an 8-0 advantage over Levante, while last season's runners-up Atletico Madrid take a 1-0 lead to Espanyol.
