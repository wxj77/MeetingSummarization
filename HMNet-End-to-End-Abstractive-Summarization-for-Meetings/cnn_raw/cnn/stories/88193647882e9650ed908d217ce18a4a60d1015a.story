(CNN) -- Pop music superstar Beyonce is indeed irreplaceable, postponing a scheduled show Tuesday in Belgium because of "dehydration and exhaustion," her representatives said.

Taking her doctors' advice, Beyonce won't perform Tuesday night in Antwerp and is "awaiting word" before deciding what to do about a second Belgium show set for Wednesday, according to a statement from her camp.

Other dates on her tour -- dubbed "The Mrs. Carter Show," the name of which comes from her status as the wife of Shawn Carter, the real name of rapper Jay-Z -- "are not expected to be affected," her representatives said.

Since kicking off April 15 in Belgrade, Serbia, Beyonce had performed all around Europe. Her last show on that continent is scheduled for London on June 1, and four weeks later she'll kick off the North American leg of her tour, which runs through August.

Shortly after the announcement about Tuesday's Belgium show -- which will be rescheduled -- a post on Beyonce's Facebook page read, "Antwerp thank you for bringing your donations to the venue today! #beyGOOD."
