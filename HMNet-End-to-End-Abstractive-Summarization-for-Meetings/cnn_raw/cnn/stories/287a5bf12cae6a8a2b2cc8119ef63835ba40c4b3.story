Nearly three-quarters of Americans questioned in a CNN/ORC poll say they don't think Russia can be trusted to uphold the terms of the ceasefire agreement it recently reached with Ukraine.

Seventy-three percent of the 1,014 Americans questioned said Russia can't be trusted to keep the terms of the ceasefire, while 24% said Moscow could be trusted to honor it.

Although the two countries agreed to a ceasefire, spotty violence continues. Pro-Russian rebels killed 10 civilians in a rocket attack in eastern Ukraine Wednesday, according to the Ukrainian military.

While many Americans are concerned about the situation in Ukraine -- with 72% saying they are either somewhat or very concerned -- they are fewer than the 78% who expressed similar sentiments in May.

The declining concern may reflect the calmer situation in Ukraine, and the fact that Americans are becoming more concerned about the terror group ISIS as the United States gets more involved in trying to stop its activities in Iraq and Syria.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is in Washington Thursday, meeting with President Barack Obama and addressing Congress.

The Ukraine issue appears to have a bipartisan consensus, with 71% of those who say they're concerned about it identifying themselves as Democrats and 75% of respondents saying they're Republicans.
