(CNN) -- King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia arrived in Casablanca, Morocco, on Saturday to continue his recovery from back surgery late last year, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.

The king, who was met by Moroccan King Mohammed VI, will undergo physical therapy in the north African country following treatment in the United States for a herniated disc and a blood clot that was causing him back pain, according to Saudi state media.

He underwent his first surgery November 24 at New York's Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. A follow-up surgery to stabilize several vertebrae in his spine was performed December 3.

Abdullah, 86, had been recuperating at his New York home since late December.
