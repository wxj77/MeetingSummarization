(CNN) -- Matt Sandusky, his wife and four children have filed a motion to have their names legally changed, court documents in Centre County, Pennsylvania, show.

Details regarding why they requested the name changes are not available because the file is sealed.

Sandusky is one of six adopted children of Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted in 2012 of sexually abusing 10 boys in a 15-year period. He is currently serving more than 30 years in prison.

Matt Sandusky originally denied being abused by his adopted father, but during jury deliberations, he admitted to his attorney that he, too, was a victim of the disgraced former Penn State assistant coach's abuse.

In a 2012 interview with police, Sandusky said his family was the reason he revealed his stepfather was abusing him.

"They can really have closure and see what the truth actually is," he said.

Matt Sandusky's birth mother lost a case against Jerry Sandusky to gain legal custody of her son when he was a child.
