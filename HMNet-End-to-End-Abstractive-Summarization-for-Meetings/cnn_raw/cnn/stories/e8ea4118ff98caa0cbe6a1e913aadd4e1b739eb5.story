BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A U.S. soldier was detained Sunday in connection with the shooting death of a civilian contractor at Contingency Operating Base Speicher in Tikrit, Iraq, the military said.

The contractor was not identified, but Houston, Texas-based military contractor KBR said the person was an employee.

The contractor died at about 8:30 a.m. "of wounds suffered in a shooting at COB Speicher," the Multi-National Division -- North said in a statement.

"We can confirm that a U.S. soldier has been identified and detained in the alleged shooting incident," Maj. Derrick Cheng, division spokesman, said in an e-mail.

"KBR can sadly confirm that one of its employees tragically died this morning in Tikrit, Iraq," KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said in a statement.

"Our thoughts and prayers remain with the employee's family," the statement said. "As the Army is leading the investigation of the incident, KBR is not providing further comment at this time. We are of course fully cooperating with the Army in its continued investigation."

No further details about the shooting were released. Cheng said the investigation is ongoing.
