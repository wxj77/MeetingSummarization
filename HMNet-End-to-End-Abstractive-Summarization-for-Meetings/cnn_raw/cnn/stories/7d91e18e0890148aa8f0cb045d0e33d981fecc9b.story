(EW.com) -- Ashton Kutcher is set to return to CBS' "Two and a Half Men."

As expected, the actor has haggled a new deal with the network and studio Warner Bros. to continue his starring role on the hit comedy, sources confirm. Co-stars Jon Cryer and Angus T. Jones will also be back.

The trio are on the verge of signing one-year deals keeping the cast intact for a tenth season. After the dramatic exit of Charlie Sheen and the hiring of Kutcher, rating for the current ninth season started off huge, with 27.7 million viewers tuning in for the September premiere. Though the show's numbers have dropped as the season has progressed, "Men" remains a very competitive series that typically ranks as the network's highest-rated Monday night show.

Deadline.com says Kutcher will earn about $700,000 per episode, Cryer "a bit less" and Jones will receive $300,000 an episode. Sources add that all three actors will receive a "modest signing bonus."
