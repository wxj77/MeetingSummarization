(PEOPLE.com) -- There's another Brady in the bunch.

Gisele Bündchen and husband Tom Brady welcomed a baby boy on Tuesday night.

Brady announced the news to reporters Wednesday after People.com reported the story. The football star called his son's birth "a wonderful experience in my life." He also told reporters happily, "I didn't get much sleep last night," USA Today reports.

Bündchen, 29, and New England Patriots quarterback Brady, 32, were married in a private ceremony in February in Los Angeles. In April, they held a follow-up wedding for friends and family at Bündchen's Costa Rican estate.

The child is the first for the Brazilian supermodel. Brady has a 2-year-old son, Jack, with actress Bridget Moynahan.

Brady had said earlier this month that he was aware of the baby's gender, but that Bündchen preferred not to know.

"I wanted to find out and she didn't, so she said, 'Go ahead,'" he explained. "It will be a surprise for her."

Reps could not be reached for comment.
