(CNN) -- Greece state broadcaster ERT is back on the air after being shut down by the government in June.

The government, facing severe economic problems, had said earlier it decided to close the broadcaster while it created a smaller operation to cut costs. That prompted protests, and the European Broadcast Union president urged Greece to reconsider.

In June, the country's top court ordered the government to restart ERT.

The new signal is airing only old movies and documentaries, not live programs, according to government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou.

Live broadcasts will be made later, Kedikoglou said.

ERT had earlier said the decision to shut down the broadcaster meant 2,656 employees would lose their jobs.

On Wednesday, employees still seemed very upset. They were holding a sit-in at ERT headquarters, lambasting what they called "a fake imitation ERT."
