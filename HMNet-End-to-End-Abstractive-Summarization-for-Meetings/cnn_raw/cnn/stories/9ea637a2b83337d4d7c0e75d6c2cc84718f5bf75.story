(CNN) -- Train commuters in major cities worldwide will get a little cheeky Sunday as part of the annual No Pants Subway Ride that ... well ... is exactly what it says.

Pranksters will converge at train stations decked out in shirts, shoes and no pants.

The only requirement is to act nonchalant -- read, listen to your iPod, chat with your fellow riders -- as you go about your normal business without any pants.

After the rides, participants will flood to pre-determined bars for cocktails and chatter.

And no. No pants there, either.

Dozens of major cities including London, New York, Washington, Mexico City and Tel Aviv, will take part in the rides, according to organizers Improv Everywhere.

Improv Everywhere started the No Pants Subway Ride in New York 10 years ago, according to its website. The New York City-based group boasts of causing "scenes of chaos and joy" usually involving socially awkward or unusual situations.

Its goal is to elicit laughs, and it has no political agenda.

Other popular pranks have included sending hundreds of participants to a beach wearing black tuxedos and evening gowns, and flooding a Best Buy store with members dressed exactly like the staff.
