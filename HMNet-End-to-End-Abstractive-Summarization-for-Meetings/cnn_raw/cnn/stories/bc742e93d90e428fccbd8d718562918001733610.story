(CNN) -- Halle Berry has a hefty new expense.

The Oscar-winning actress has to pay over $16,000 in child support each month to her ex, Gabriel Aubry, to provide for their 6-year-old daughter Nahla, the Los Angeles Superior Court ordered.

Berry's monthly bill will remain in effect until Nahla turns 19 or graduates high school, whichever occurs first, according to court documents obtained by CNN. The settlement came on May 30, at the end of lengthy child support legal battle.

The court also ordered Berry to pay $115,000 retroactively in child support, as well as to cover her ex-boyfriend's legal fees, which amount to $300,000. The "X-Men: Days of Future Past" star is fully responsible for Nahla's tuition, while both parents will divide health care costs.

Berry and the Canadian model met in 2005 and split in spring 2010 and have since been entangled in bitter custody and child support litigation. Tensions erupted in a physical altercation between Aubry and Berry's husband, Olivier Martinez, on Thanksgiving Day 2012, when Aubry came to Berry's home to drop off then 4-year-old Nahla.

Berry and Aubry's legal battles also include Berry seeking to relocate their daughter to France, and Nahla's nanny filing a restraining order against Aubry. Since their custody dispute came to an end in spring 2011, both parents have shared equal custody of Nahla.

Nahla is Aubry's only child. Berry is a mother of two. She gave birth to a son with Martinez in October of last year.
