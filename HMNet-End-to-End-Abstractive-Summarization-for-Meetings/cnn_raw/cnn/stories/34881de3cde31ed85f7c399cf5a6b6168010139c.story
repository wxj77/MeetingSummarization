(CNN) -- May the force be with them.

George Lucas, the Hollywood writer, director and producer who's most known for his work on the Star Wars film franchise, wed his longtime girlfriend over the weekend.

Lucasfilm spokeswoman Lynne Hale told CNN that Lucas, 69, and Mellody Hobson, 44, were married north of San Francisco Saturday at Skywalker Ranch.

Hobson is president of Chicago-based Ariel Investments and sits on numerous corporate boards.

"It was a beautiful ceremony," Hale said.

Journalist Bill Moyers officiated, she said, and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley walked Hobson down the aisle.

In a Twitter post Sunday, actor and director Ron Howard said the wedding was a "joy to behold."

"Bill Moyers service was beautiful," he wrote, "nothing short of profound."
