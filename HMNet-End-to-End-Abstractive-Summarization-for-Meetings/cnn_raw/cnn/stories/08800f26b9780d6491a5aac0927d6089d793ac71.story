(CNN Student News) -- October 21, 2013

CNN Student News begins the week with a report on wildfires in Australia, and we discuss the challenges that refugees face after fleeing violence in Syria. We also explore a dispute between a university and many of its football players. Plus, we check out a flying car, and we share the history of a violin that fetched a Titanic record at auction.
