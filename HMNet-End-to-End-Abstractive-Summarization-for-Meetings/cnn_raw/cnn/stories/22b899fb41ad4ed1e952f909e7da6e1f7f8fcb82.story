(CNN) -- A Texas inmate escaped from a prison van near Houston after pulling a gun on two guards who were transporting him between prisons, according to a Texas prison statement Monday.

Arcade Joseph Comeaux Jr., 49, ran away with the guards' guns and wearing one of their gray correctional officer uniforms, the statement from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said.

Comeaux was serving a life sentence for indecency with a child, aggravated sexual assault and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, it said.

The escape happened near Baytown, Texas, about 25 miles east of Houston, it said.

He was being taken from the Estelle prison in Huntsville to the Stiles prison in Beaumont, a 150-mile drive, when he "brandished a firearm and directed the officers to stop the vehicle," the statement said.

"He took the officers' weapons and apparently handcuffed them together in the back of the transport vehicle," it said.

Police found the handcuffed guards unharmed in the vehicle at 10 a.m. CT, the statement said.
