(CNN) -- Robinho fired AC Milan to a shock 1-0 victory over league leaders Juventus to end the Turin club's 25-match unbeaten streak away from home in Serie A.

Juventus had not tasted defeat on the road in the domestic league since May 1 2011 but was unable to find a way to see off an inspired Milan.

While Juventus, fresh from its 3-0 thrashing of European champion Chelsea, has enjoyed a stellar start to the campaign, Milan has looked lacklustre.

Club owner and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi visited the players last week to discuss the team's failings.

And those words of wisdom appeared to have the desired effect as the home side produced the kind of performance which had been so sorely missing in previous weeks.

The breakthrough came just after the half-hour mark when Mauricio Isla handled the ball inside the penalty area and Robinho fired home from the spot.

Alessio Cerci put the home side ahead five minutes before the break only for Gonzalo Rodriguez to level from the penalty spot.

Marvellous Messi

Tito Vilanova's side set a new league record after scoring four goals away from home for the fourth game in a row.

Messi is now just four goals away from surpassing Gerd Muller's record of 85, which came during his time playing for Bayern Munich and Germany in 1972.

Sevilla, who lost Federico Fazio after just 22 minutes, was three goals down at the break as Atletico recorded its seventh consecutive home win.

The visiting side was reduced to nine men on 83 minutes after Ivan Rakitic picked up a second yellow card and Miranda rubbed salt in Sevilla's wounds by firing home a late fourth.

Florent Balmont was sent off in first-half stoppage time with Jordan Ayew scoring a minute after the interval to seal the victory.
