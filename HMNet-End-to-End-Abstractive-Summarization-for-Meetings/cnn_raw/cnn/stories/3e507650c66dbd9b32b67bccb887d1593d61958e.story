U.S. President George W. Bush announces his government's bank bailout plan.

Meanwhile, U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday of a $250 billion bailout plan to help stabilize the financial system.

In Washington, Bush said the Treasury would buy into banks in return for shares using authority granted in the country's $700 billion bailout bill.

However, Paulson stressed taxpayers would get a return on their money and banking excesses would be brought to an end.

"Institutions that sell shares to the government will accept restrictions on executive compensation, including a clawback provision and a ban on golden parachutes during the period that Treasury holds equity issued through this program," he said.

"This new capital will help struggling banks to fill the hole filled by crisis during the time we are in," Bush said. "This is a short-term measure to insure the viability of America's banking system."  Watch Bush announce the plan »

He also announced that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would "temporarily guarantee most new debt" issued by banks.

"This will address one of the central problems plaguing our financial system -- banks have been unable to borrow money and that has constricted their ability to lend to consumer and businesses," Bush said.

"When money flows freely between banks, it will make it easy for Americans to borrow money for homes and cars."

The government, through the FDIC, would also immediately and temporarily insure non-interest-bearing transaction accounts which were used mainly by small businesses "to cover day-to-day operations."

"By insuring every dollar in these accounts, we will give small business owners piece of mind and bring greater stability to the banking system," Bush said.

Governments have rushed to pump capital into banks after a series of large failures left the financial system teetering on the edge of insolvency.

Paulson said the government would get preference shares in return for its investment.

"Nine large financial institutions have already agreed to participate in this program. They have agreed to sell preferred shares to the US government, on the same terms that will be available to a broad array of small and medium-sized banks."  Watch more on the bailout funding »

According to reports banking giants Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch would be among those to receive funding.

Meanwhile Iceland's stock exchange reopened Tuesday for the first time since trading was suspended last Wednesday, with a value 76 percent lower than at its close value last week.

Icelandic officials cautioned, however, that the new value reflected the absence of the three big banks that were nationalized last week and which represented 80 percent of Iceland's stock market.

Taking that into account, exchange spokeswoman Kristen Johannsdottir said the market was down only 2 percent in early trading.
