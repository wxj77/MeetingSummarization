8 p.m. CNN's Ed Henry reports:

Senior officials said the president's broad goal was to seize back the mantle of change by talking about the need for a "new beginning" between Democrats and Republicans that can restore trust in Washington.

Along these lines, the president was to make what officials described as a passing reference to the special election in Massachusetts but would not have a "chastened" tone like Bill Clinton after the 1994 election. Instead, officials said he would use the election defeat as a way to challenge Republicans to meet him halfway on the major issues facing the nation.

Officials said he would note that with Republicans now having 41 votes in the Senate, they can't just block everything.

The first test will come next week when the Senate is expected to begin debate on a jobs bill. The president was to specifically try to sprinkle the jobs bill with small business and corporate tax cuts to win over some Republican votes and call their bluff if they do not come on board.

While jobs and the economy were to make up the bulk of the speech, officials said health care would also figure prominently. But they noted the president would not get too specific on the path forward because key lawmakers want to take a deep breath on the volatile issue while ramping up much more time on the jobs legislation.

Beyond jobs and health care, officials said the second tier of the agenda would focus on three primary issues:

-- Financial regulatory reform, which would give the president another chance to press Wall Street to change the rules of the road to prevent another crisis.

-- Climate change legislation, where the president would specifically cite the work of lawmakers in both parties trying to broker a compromise.

-- Education reform, where the president would push for an increase of up to $4 billion despite lean times for other key parts of his budget.
