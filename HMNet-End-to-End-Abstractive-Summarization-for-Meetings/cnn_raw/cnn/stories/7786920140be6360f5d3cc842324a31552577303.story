(PEOPLE.com) -- "I really want to start dancing again," Chaz Bono tells PEOPLE.

No, he's not expecting to be invited back to "Dancing with the Stars," where he lasted an impressive six weeks this past fall. He's looking to woo the ladies on the dance floor, explains the newly single Bono, who split with his fiancÃ©e in December.

"What a great skill: to be able to take a woman dancing ... and actually know what you're doing!"

Bono's been staying active, maintaining his DWTS weight loss by taking up boxing and skiing over the Christmas holiday with his family. He'd understandably taken some time off from the slopes, explaining, "First I was a drug addict and then my dad died skiing, so that kind of turned me off a bit."

But back in the dating pool, fitness is important, and Bono is hoping that the world can start to see past him as a trans man.

"People focus on what's between your legs," says Bono. "If I never have bottom surgery [the procedure by which a penis is created], I'm fine. I feel 100 percent male as I am."

Bono adds that any further surgery is not a big priority at this time. "When I was doing Dancing, I had a leak in my roof. A new roof was definitely more of a priority," he says with a laugh.
