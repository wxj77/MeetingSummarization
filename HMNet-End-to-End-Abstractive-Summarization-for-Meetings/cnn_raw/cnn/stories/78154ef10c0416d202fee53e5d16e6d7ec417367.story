(CNN) -- Burkino Faso have been cleared to participate in the Africa Cup of Nations after Namibia's claims they fielded an ineligible player were thrown out by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

Namibia claimed that Burkino Faso should have been removed from the tournament -- which pits the continent's best sides against each other -- because Cameroon-born defender Herve Zengue wasn't eligible.

They appealed to African soccer's ruling body, the Confederation of African Football (CAF), whose decision to dismiss the case has now been upheld by CAS.

Burkino Faso won both their matches against Namibia during qualifying for the Africa Cup of Nations, with Zengue featuring in both games. He was given a five-year passport from Burkino Faso in March 2011.

CAF threw out Namibia's appeal on the basis that their protest letter did not meet certain criteria laid down in their regulations and CAS backed their decision.

Burkino Faso can now look ahead to taking their place at the tournament in Group B alongside Ivory Coast, Sudan and Angola.

This year's competition will be hosted by Gabon and Equatorial Guinea and starts on January 21.
