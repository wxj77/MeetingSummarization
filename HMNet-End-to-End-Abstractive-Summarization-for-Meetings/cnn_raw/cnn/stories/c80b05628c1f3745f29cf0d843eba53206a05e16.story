(CNN) -- A part-time actor has been accused of killing his neighbor and then luring the victim's friend to her death in an attempt to cover up his crime, authorities in California said.

The Costa Mesa Police Department last week charged Daniel Wozniak, 27, with two counts of murder. Wozniak is being held without bail and will be arraigned June 25, said Farrah Emami, spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney's Office.

Wozniak has been accused in the shooting death of Samuel Herr, 26, and Juri Kibuishi, 23, of Irvine, police said.

According to investigators, Wozniak and Herr, who lived in the same residential complex in Costa Mesa, drove to the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base on Friday, May 21. It is at the base that Wozniak shot and killed Herr for financial gain, police said.

The suspect cut off Herr's head, left arm and right hand and discarded the body parts at a park in Long Beach, police said.

After the slaying, Wozniak used Herr's cell phone to text Kibuishi and arrange for her to come to Herr's apartment, investigators alleged.

Shortly after midnight on May 22, Kibuishi arrived at the Herr's home, where she was shot and killed by Wozniak, police said.

"Wozniak then staged the crime scene to appear as if a sexual assault had occurred by partially removing her clothing," police said in a statement.

In addition, investigators said a 17-year-old individual was directed by Wozniak to make several ATM withdrawals using Herr's bank card.

Several law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, have been assisting the Costa Mesa Police.

From April 23 to May 23, Wozniak starred in a local theater's production of the musical "Nine."

In a statement, the Hunger Artists Theatre Company said, "We at Hunger Artists are horrified and saddened by the deaths of Juri Kibuishi and Samuel Eliezer Herr.  Our hearts and deepest condolences go out to their friends and families in this tragic time."
