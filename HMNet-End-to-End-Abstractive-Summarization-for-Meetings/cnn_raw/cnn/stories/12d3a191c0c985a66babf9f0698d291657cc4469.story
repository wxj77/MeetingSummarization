(CNN) -- Never mind those pesky norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships earlier this year. And who wants to hear more unappetizing details from the first Carnival Triumph "poop cruise" trial?

Millions of cruisers set sail every year for fun, sun and relaxation, and we assume that most of them return home happy and rested. Disney's cruise ships seem to make many of those cruisers especially happy, as seen from their big wins at the 2014 Cruise Critic Cruisers' Choice Awards, the Cruise Critic website announced Wednesday.

Disney's Fantasy ship took 6 of 10 awards in the large ship category, while Disney's Wonder took 3 of 10 awards in the mid-size ship category.

"The Cruisers' Choice Awards are a fantastic honor for cruise lines to receive as they're based on personal experiences shared by cruisers themselves," said Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic. "This list of winners truly reflects excellence in the industry, and serves as a seal of approval from consumers who have sailed on these ships over the past year."

The awards are bestowed in three different ship categories, based on passenger capacity. Large ships carry 2,000 or more passengers. Mid-size ships carry 1,200 to 1,999 passengers. Small ships carry less than 1200. Awards are calculated using Cruise Critic member ratings.
