Hong Kong (CNN) -- In the usually sleepy world of Hong Kong stock exchange filings, a new document is gaining attention for its unintentionally hilarious descriptions of nightclub life.

The 378-page prospectus lays out the risks and potential rewards of investing in a new stock offering for "Magnum Entertainment Group Holdings," the owner of three nightclubs in Hong Kong.

In doing so, the document puts exact definitions on terms that may seem obvious to anyone who has ever stayed out past midnight.

Clubs, for example, are defined as establishments that include "a dance floor and high-energy music." The prospectus elaborates, explaining that "they are equipped with DJ booths where music that is intended to motivate customers to dance is played, and the volume of such music is usually high."

Club-goers apparently tend to buy lots of beverages, including champagne and something called a cocktail, which is "generally known as alcoholic beverages served by glass and prepared by bartenders mixing different alcohol and ingredients."

Want to understand more late-night lingo? The prospectus tells us "there has been a trend of 'club-hopping' developing in Hong Kong in recent years which means customers have the tendency to visit multiple clubs in one night."

VIPs are given special privileges, including free entry, discounts and other perks. "For instance, the managers of the Clubs may assist VIP Customers to store their unfinished bottle of liquor or wine upon request."

Another great revelation? In addition to liquor licenses, Hong Kong clubs are required to have "dancing endorsements." Without such permission, it seems the club could turn into a scene out of "Footloose."

Of course, the prospectus isn't supposed to be a guide to Hong Kong nightlife. The document is aimed at potential shareholders, not potential clubgoers. With Magnum shares already trading at nearly twice the offering price, those investors may be laughing all the way to the bank.
