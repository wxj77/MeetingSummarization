(CNN) -- Authorities early Friday captured a man accused of killing his mother and stepfather who escaped from a South Carolina mental health facility.

Jason Mark Carter, 39, was committed after he was found incompetent to stand trial in the killings eight years ago.

Carter escaped the mental institution about 10 a.m. Thursday, apparently stealing a van from a state hospital, authorities said. He later purchased a Chevrolet Lumina, and South Carolina authorities pinged his cell phone as he was traveling on Interstate 40 in Tennessee, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said in a prepared statement.

Shortly before 7 a.m., a trooper saw Carter's car outside a hotel, where he was taken into custody without incident.

CNN affiliate WISTV reported that Carter worked at a supply office on the hospital campus.

Before his capture, we was thought to be traveling in a stolen 1991 White Chevrolet van, the Oconee County, South Carolina, Sheriff's Office said in a prepared statement.

In March 2006, deputies went for a welfare check at a home in Seneca and found the bodies of Kevin and Debra Ann Perkins in a room in the basement, the Sheriff's Office said.

Carter was in the room with the victims, who were wrapped in plastic bags, according to officials.

At his trial, his attorney said Carter had no recollection of the crime, the affiliate said.

CNN's Jennifer Moore contributed to this report.
