Los Angeles (CNN) -- The IRS has issued a tax lien against singer Lionel Richie for unpaid taxes, the performer said through his publicist Friday.

"I was recently made aware of the situation by my new team, and it's being handled immediately," said Richie, 62.

The confirmation came on the same day that CBS was scheduled to later air "ACM Presents: Lionel Richie and Friends in Concert" after the Academy of Country Music Awards telecast.

The concert is to include solo performances and duets with Richie, and is to feature a number of Richie hits from his country duets album "Tuskegee," which debuted last month.
