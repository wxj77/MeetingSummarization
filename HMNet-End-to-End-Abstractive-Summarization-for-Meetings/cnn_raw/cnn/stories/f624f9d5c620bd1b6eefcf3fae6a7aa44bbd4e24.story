(CNN) -- As if Sebastian Vettel's eighth straight win wasn't rubbing the opposition's noses in it, Red Bull claimed another Formula One first by clocking the first sub two-second pit stop at the U.S. Grand Prix on Sunday.

According to the British-based team's website, no.2 driver Mark Webber was stationary for 1.923 seconds in his one pit stop during the race at the Circuit of the Americas.

The team, who secured a fourth consecutive constructors' championship at the Indian Grand Prix in October, described the time as "an incredible feat."

The mark surpasses Red Bull's F1 record of 2.05 seconds set at the Malaysian Grand Prix last April -- a substantial improvement on the sport's previous best time of 2.31 seconds set by McLaren in 2012.

"There's always a quicker stop out there," the team said in April before predicting the "magical two-second barrier" could be broken this season.

Team boss Christian Horner said it had been "an incredible team performance" at Austin.

"For Sebastian to achieve a new record of the most consecutive wins in a season is a fantastic performance and to be joined on the podium by Mark, who tried everything in the closing laps, gave a team a fantastic podium at the United States Grand Prix," Horner said.

"To achieve this result in front of so many of our team partners and supporters, as well as setting a potential new pit stop record on Mark's stop, has topped off a fantastic weekend for the whole team."
