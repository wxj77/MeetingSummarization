(CNN) -- Jay Z and Beyonce continue to be full of surprises.

In the midst of all of the hoopla surrounding the now well-known elevator incident involving the couple and Beyonce's younger sister, Solange Knowles, the superstar pair have released a "trailer" for their upcoming tour.

The star-studded short features cameos from actors Jake Gyllenhaal (who is now part of meme history thanks to a recent courtside photo with the superstar couple), Sean Penn, Don Cheadle, "Scandal" actor Guillermo DÃ¬az, Blake Lively, Emmy Rossum, and sisters Rashida and Kidada Jones. Directed by Melina Matsoukas, who has worked with Beyonce on music videos, the minimovie is meant to promote the 16-city "On The Run" tour, which will mark the first time the singer and her rapper husband have toured jointly.

In the trailer, the couple portray a pair of outlaw lovers seen making deals, executing a heist, running from the authorities and sharing tender moments in a hotel room.

One scene shows them emerging from an elevator wearing masks -- which could be seen as a bit of irony, given the recent headlines following the release of a surveillance video showing Solange Knowles punching and kicking Jay Z in a hotel elevator while Beyonce stood nearby on the night of the Met Gala in New York City.

The trio have since released a statement which says in part, "We love each other and above all we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same."

Music featuring the rap mogul and his wife play in the almost four-minute video, which hit the Web on Saturday. Titled "Run," it's listed as a joint production between Jay Z's Roc Nation and Beyonce's Parkwood Entertainment.

The "On The Run" stadium tour kicks off June 25 in Miami.
