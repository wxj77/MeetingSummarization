(CNN) -- His World Cup was brutally cut short by injury, but Brazilian star Neymar could yet end up a winner after the Barcelona forward was named on FIFA's Golden Ball shortlist to decide the tournament's best player.

Neymar fractured his vertebra in his team's World Cup quarterfinal win over Colombia, ruling him out of Brazil's 7-1 semifinal defeat by Germany, who had four players -- Thomas Mueller, Philipp Lahm, Mats Hummels and Toni Kroos -- nominated.

Germany's World Cup final opponents Argentina had three players -- forwards Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria as well as midfielder Javier Mascherano -- selected.

Together with Neymar, who scored four goals in the tournament, Colombia's James Rodriguez and Arjen Robben of the Netherlands complete the shortlist, with the winner to be announced after Sunday's final at the Maracana Stadium.

Italian Nicola Rizzoli, a 42-year-old architect from Bologna, has been selected by FIFA as the World Cup final referee, with the world governing body announcing the winners of Sunday's match will receive $35 million in prize money.

The best goalkeeper of the tournament -- the Golden Glove award -- is between Keylor Navas of Costa Rica, Germany's Manuel Neuer and Sergio Romero of Argentina.

The best young player of the 2014 World Cup will be contested between Memphis Depay of the Netherlands and Paul Pogba and Raphael Varane of France.

Uruguay's Diego Forlan won the 2010 Golden Ball award.
