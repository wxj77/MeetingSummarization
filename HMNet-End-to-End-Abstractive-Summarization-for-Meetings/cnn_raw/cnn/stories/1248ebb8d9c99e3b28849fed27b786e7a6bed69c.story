(CNN) -- A 4-year-old Arizona boy reported missing was found by horseback riders in a steep canyon Monday morning after an 18-hour search, police said.

Travis Mitchell appeared in "good spirits" and had no signs of injury, Payson, Arizona, police said in a statement. He was taken to a local hospital and reunited with his volunteers.

Travis was playing with several other children about 5 p.m. Sunday in a wooded area of a neighborhood west of the Payson airport, authorities said. When the children returned home, Travis was not with them, Payson police said in a statement. The boy's parents and friends began searching and called police when they could not find him.

Several agencies were participating in the search Monday, along with "numerous friends, family and citizens of Payson," police said. "There is no indication of foul play at this time."

Travis was the third Arizona toddler to be reported missing recently. The body of 2-year-old Emmett Trapp was found earlier this month about a mile from his home in Yavapai County, lying in a muddy pit once used to collect waste products from a former mining site. He had been missing for two days. Police said at the time there were no indications of foul play and that the cause of the child's death appeared to be exposure.

Sylar Newton, also 2, went missing July 25 from a camping site in Rimrock, Arizona, and is presumed dead, police have said.

CNN's Melanie Whitley and HLN's Natisha Lance contributed to this report.
