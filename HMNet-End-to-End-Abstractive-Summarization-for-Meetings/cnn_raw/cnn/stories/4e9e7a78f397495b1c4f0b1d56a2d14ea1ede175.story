(EW.com) -- Tick tock.

As "Catching Fire" nears its start date, another new member has been added to the cast of "The Hunger Games" sequel -- Amanda Plummer, the actress best known for playing meek and mad characters in "So I Married an Axe Murderer," "The Fisher King" and "Needful Things."

As fans of the Suzanne Collins book could probably guess from those first two words of the story, she'll be playing a character who becomes a critical ally to Katniss Everdeen...Wiress is a veteran tribute from District 3, drawn back to the games by the Quarter Quell -- an all-star edition of the games in which past victors are forced to once again compete against each other in a fight to the death.

She's more than a little twitchy from her violent history, however, and is considered mad by some of her rivals, who nickname her "Nuts." Her muttering of one phrase over and over again doesn't bolster much confidence, but there is actually method to her madness. Wiress is more astute than she seems.

Also, anyone who remembers this actress as diner-robbing Honey Bunny in "Pulp Fiction" knows she can be a fearsome presence with a weapon.

Plummer, 55, the daughter of recent Oscar-winner Christopher Plummer, is the latest addition to "The Hunger Games" world, which recently added Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee, the gamesmaster who oversees the Quarter Quell on behalf of the government of Panem.
