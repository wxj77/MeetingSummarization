Months after "Once Upon a Time's" big season three finale reveal—Elsa has arrived! "Frozen" is joining the fairy tale fray!—the fantasy series has finally cast two key roles based on characters from Disney's blockbuster musical.

"Greek" alum Scott Michael Foster will play Kristoff, the rugged mountain man who befriends Queen Elsa's younger sister Anna, played by newcomer Elizabeth Lail. EW has confirmed that both roles will be recurring in season four.

Conspicuously missing is Queen E herself; casting for Elsa has yet to be revealed.

According to TVLine, which first reported the news, the "Frozen" arc will ostensibly pick up after the events of the film, with Anna and Kristoff already romantically linked and the latter adjusting to a new life as a castle-bound royal.
