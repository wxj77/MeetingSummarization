(EW.com ) -- Will Chris Soules ever love any woman as much as he loves corn? We're about to find out.

On today's Good Morning America, Soules was officially announced as the next Bachelor. Although it's not a surprising pickâ€”most everyone predicted this was a possibility at some pointâ€”it is one that took a surprising amount of time to make.

Soules, also known as the hot farmer from Iowa on Andi's season of The Bachelorette, didn't gain much of a fan following until the end of his time on the show, which could've led to the show's slow decision-making. As Chris Harrison put it after the Bachelorette finale, "There are endless discussions and heated debates on which direction to go and what to do. We are very close to making that decision, but the only big mistake we could really make is to rush this and try to get it done in time for last night's show."

Or perhaps it took so long because they were worried about finding 25 attractive women who'd willingly want to move to Iowa? Regardless, the hot farmer with the world's greatest family is bringing his charm (and buckets of money) back to California for another shot at love. Let's just hope he gets a secret admirer of his own (and that she knows how to play Ghosts in the Graveyard).
