(CNN) -- LinkedIn employees seem to love their boss.

Jeff Weiner has claimed the number one spot in Glassdoor's latest survey of highest rated CEOs at large companies, getting a perfect 100% approval score from his staff. The LinkedIn boss was followed by Ford Motor's Alan Mulally and Edelman's Richard Edelman, both with 97% approval.

Each year jobs and career website Glassdoor collects feedback from U.S.-based employees, in which they anonymously say what they think of the way their boss is leading their company. To be considered for the survey, chief executives at U.S.-headquartered large companies had to receive at least 100 approved reviews, according to Glassdoor.
