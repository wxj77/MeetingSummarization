(CNN) -- Was the third time a charm for Jim Carrey as the host of "Saturday Night Live?"

The stakes were pretty high for the elastic-faced funnyman, whose new movie "Dumb and Dumber To" comes out next month. Preliminary reviews of his SNL performance were mixed, but there's no denying that Carrey rose to the occasion, leading to some hilarious scenes.

He took a trip down memory lane as the SNL cast impersonated his biggest roles in a family reunion, which included a cameo from "Dumb and Dumber" co-star Jeff Daniels.

Other memorable moments included a parody within a parody with his take on actor Matthew McConaughey's odd Lincoln car commercials.

He also showed off his penchant for physical comedy in a dance-off with "SNL" cast member Kate McKinnon to Sia's "Chandelier" music video, complete with nude body suits and a cameo from musical guest Iggy Azalea.
