Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a funeral procession that killed at least 37 people in northwest Pakistan.

More than 50 others were wounded when the bomber detonated explosives during a funeral on the outskirts of Peshawar, said police official Kalam Khan.

He said a hand grenade was found at the site after explosion. Security forces promptly defused it.

The attack occurred at the funeral of the wife of a member of a pro-government militia group, said Muhammad Ejaz Khan, a senior city police official.

A few hours after the blast, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said his group was behind the blast.

"We will keep continuing such attacks on all those who support U.S. and the Pakistan military," said spokesman Ihsanullah Ihsan, referring to pro-government militia groups.
