(CNN) -- The Ivory Coast have reportedly sacked coach Vahid Halilhodzic despite the Bosnian having guided the African team to this year's World Cup finals.

Russia coach Guus Hiddink is among the favorites to take over for football's showpiece tournament starting in June, according to a report from the British Press Association which was carried on the Web site of world ruling body FIFA on Saturday.

It said the 57-year-old Halihodzic, who took charge in 2008, had been axed after the Ivorians failed to live up to their favorite status at the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola last month and lost in the quarterfinals to Algeria.

"This Saturday I brought Vahid Halilhodzic's contract to an end because one of the aims that was set for him was not reached and that was to win the 2010 African Nations Cup," Cote d'Ivoire football federation president Jacques Anouma reportedly said on national television.

Hiddink's contract with Russia expires on June 30, two weeks after the finals start, and he has a free period before taking over the reigns with Turkey in August.

The Dutchman was also linked with the vacant Nigeria coaching role, which subsequently went to former Sweden manager Lars Lagerback, who signed a five-month contract on Friday.

Hiddink recently revealed to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, who played for him in a brief spell while coaching English club Chelsea, had sounded him out about taking the job.

"The interest from Ivory Coast is real, but first I have to analyze the situation," Hiddink said. "I need to solve some matters before making my decision.

"Drogba asked me in the name of the players to accept the invitation. The Ivorian federation is also very interested."
