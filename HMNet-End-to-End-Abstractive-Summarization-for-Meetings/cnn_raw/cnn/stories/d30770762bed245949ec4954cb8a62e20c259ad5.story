(CNN)  -- Barcelona will parade their incredible six-trophy haul from 2009 as they begin the New Year with a home league clash against Villarreal on Saturday in the Camp Nou.

Barca won an historic treble of Spanish league, Spanish Cup and and Champions League titles last season, their first under former captain Pep Guardiola.

The Catalan giants added to the tally by scooping the Spanish and European Supercups and rounded off 2009 with victory in the World Club Cup last month, beating Estudiantes of Argentina in the final.

They begin 2010 on course to repeat the initial treble and have a two-point lead over arch-rivals Real Madrid as La Liga resumes after a brief festive break.

In celebration of their success, Barca have invited players who left the club in the summer, including Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto'o, to take part in the pre-match parade.

Brazil star Dani Alves is keen for his teammates to maintain their winning spree and is hungry for more trophies.

"We'll do everything we can to make sure that this book has more than one page," he told the official club Web site www.fcbarcelona.com.

"We've achieved some really important stuff, but now we've got to keep on working hard and improving things," he added.

Guardiola's team face possibly nine matches in a busy month and are also missing players on Africa Cup of Nations duty.

Jeffren and Seydou Keita miss out through injury against Villarreal who drew 3-3 at the Camp Nou last season after being 3-1 down.

Gonzalo Rodriguez is ruled out, but Villarreal, who are on a fine run of form, should be otherwise full-strength.

Big-spending Real Madrid resume their campaign with an away trip to Osasuna on Sunday.
