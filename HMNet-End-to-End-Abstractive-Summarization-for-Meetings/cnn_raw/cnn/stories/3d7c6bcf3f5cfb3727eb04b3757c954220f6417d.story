(RollingStone.com) -- Eddie Vedder's second solo album "Ukulele Songs" and a live concert film titled "Water on the Road" will both be released on May 31st, Vedder announced today. As the title suggests, "Ukulele Songs" will feature Vedder performing original songs and covers on his ukulele.

Cat Power's Chan Marshall and Glen Hansard of the Frames and the Swell Season will guest on one track each, and the set will include a new recording of the Pearl Jam tune "Can't Keep." The album's first single "Longing to Belong" will be available in digital stores tomorrow.

"Water on the Road," Vedder's first solo concert film, was directed by Brendan Canty of Fugazi and Christoph Green at a pair of shows in Washington, D.C. in August of 2008.

That set will include several songs from Vedder's soundtrack for the film "Into the Wild" along with early versions of "Ukulele Songs" tracks, covers and relatively obscure Pearl Jam numbers such as "Sometimes," "Driftin'" and "Around the Bend."
