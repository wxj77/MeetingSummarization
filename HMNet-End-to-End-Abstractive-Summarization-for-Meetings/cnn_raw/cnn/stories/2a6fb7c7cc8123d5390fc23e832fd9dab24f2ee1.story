Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A blast targeting Shiites in a busy Pakistani marketplace killed at least 78 people on Saturday, police told CNN.

The attack in the southwestern Pakistan city of Quetta left at least 180 people wounded.

The explosives were packed into a parked water tanker and were remotely detonated, said Mir Zubair Mehmood, a senior police official in Quetta.

The South Asian nation, overwhelmingly Sunni, has been beset by sectarian strife and attacks for years.

Mehmood said the attack targeted a Shiite Hazara community. Ethnic Hazaras live mostly in Afghanistan, and there are also Hazara enclaves in Afghanistan and Iran.

President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf strongly condemned the bombing and vowed to go after the militants.

Earlier this year, a wave of attacks in Quetta left 87 people dead in the Shiite community.
