(CNN) -- 1. The NAFTA debate between Al Gore and Ross Perot -- It's an obvious choice for me. It changed history. Bill Clinton called the next day to say that NAFTA never would have passed without that show. So all things considered, I chose this for its impact and importance -- it had the largest viewership in cable history at the time. So that's why it's my number one.

2. Frank Sinatra -- He is, in my opinion, the foremost entertainer of the 20th century. And one of the hardest gets to get. And it was his last interview as well as a great conversation.

3. Marlon Brando -- He, like Frank Sinatra, was impossible to get. I think Marlon Brando was the foremost actor of his time. And as with Sinatra, it was just an incredible interview. Plus, I got a kiss out of it!

4. Mideast Peace -- Such an important show. Having three leaders -- of Jordan, Israel and Palestine -- on at the same time had worldwide relevance. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. It was worldwide diplomacy happening right there. How can you top that?

5. Ground Zero -- It was the worst thing to ever happen to the United States in modern history. Just getting to go there two weeks later, to walk among the rubble, to interview firemen and policemen, the first responders, to go to the burn center at the hospital, to see what happened up close -- it was living history. It is something I'll never forget.
