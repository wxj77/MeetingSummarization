President Barack Obama is meeting with a bipartisan set of newly elected governors on Friday -- including one who's suing him.

Obama has a 4:55 p.m. meeting in the Oval Office with incoming GOP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as well as the Republican victors in Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts, the Democratic winners in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, and Alaska's newly elected independent governor.

Abbott is leading the 17-state legal challenge of Obama's recent executive action to halt deportations of the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens, arguing that immigration policy should be left in the hands of Congress.

The meeting comes as part of Obama's outreach effort after Democrats were trounced in November's midterm elections.

States could play a key role in cementing Obama's legacy. Three of the states that elected GOP governors -- Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts -- operate, at least in part, their own health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.

Obama also met privately for an hour with the presumptive new Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, on Wednesday.

"We had a good conversation about a variety of different issues where we might possibly find common ground," the Kentucky Republican told CNN afterward.
