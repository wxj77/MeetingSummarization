(CNN) -- "The Walking Dead" fans always fill CNN.com's comments sections and iReport with questions and observations about TV's hottest show.

We asked executive producer Gale Anne Hurd and actors Norman Reedus (fan favorite Daryl) and Laurie Holden (Andrea, one of the most-discussed characters this season) to respond to the "Dead"-heads in our community, in time for Sunday night's season finale on AMC.

As "Talking Dead" host Chris Hardwick might put it, thanks for submitting your quemments!
