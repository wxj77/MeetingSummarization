(CNN) -- Palermo edged Inter Milan 4-3 in a thriller in Sicily, while Juventus opened their new stadium in style by defeating Parma 4-1 in Sunday's Italian Serie A matches.

A double from Fabrizio Milito and goals from and Abel Hernandez and Maurizio Pinilla gave Palermo a dream start to the season as Inter lost despite Diego Milito twice giving them the lead and Diego Forlan scoring on his debut.

Meanwhile, in Turin, debutants Stephan Lichsteiner and Arturo Vidal, along with Simone Pepe and Claudio Marchisio, all found the net for Juventus, who conceded a late consolation penalty from Sebastian Giovinco.

Elsewhere, new Roma coach Luis Enrique had a disastrous debut as his team lost 2-1 at home to Cagliari and finished with 10 men.

Meanwhile, in the day's two English Premier League matches, Nigerian striker Peter Odemwingie scored a third-minute opener -- but then missed a penalty -- as West Bromwich claimed their first win of the season with a 1-0 success at Norwich.

In the other game, bottom side Blackburn earned their first point of the season, but Bobby Zamora's well-taken equalizer gave hosts Fulham a 1-1 draw after a fine strike from Ruben Rochina had put Rovers ahead.

In the German Bundesliga, both matches finished 2-1, with two Timmy Simons penalties giving Nuremberg victory at Cologne.

Meanwhile, Schalke missed out on the chance to claim a top three place when they let a 1-0 lead at Wolfsburg, for whom Mario Mandzukic scored twice.

There were only seven goals scored in the five Spanish Primera Liga matches with Rayo Vallecano versus Real Zaragoza and Racing Santander against Levante both ending 0-0.

Ruben Castro's late winner gave Real Betis a 1-0 success over Mallorca as the Seville-based club joined Real Madrid and Valencia on maximum points after two matches.

Elsewhere, Osasuna beat Sporting Gijon 2-1 for their first win of the season while Espanyol defeated Athletic Bilbao by the same score.
