(CNN) -- A defensive end for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was arraigned late Monday night after being accused of having a semiautomatic weapon in his suitcase at New York's LaGuardia Airport, according to the Queens District Attorney's Office.

Da'Quan Bowers, 22, was charged with second-degree criminal possession by Judge Toko Serita in New York Criminal Court late Monday night, according to Meris Campbell of the Queens District Attorney's Office.

Bail was set at $10,000, Campbell said. Video recorded outside the courthouse Monday night showed Bowers getting into a car and driving away after the arraignment.

Bowers was arrested at an airport ticket counter with a .40-caliber handgun, according to Rudy King, a spokesperson for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport.

Campbell said there were no bullets in the gun, but there were bullets near the gun in a separate location. According to New York firearms law, if bullets are found next to the weapon, it is considered loaded, Campbell said.

Bowers was headed to North Carolina and was flying on US Airways, Campbell said.

In a statement CNN obtained from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Monday, General Manager Mark Dominik said: "We are aware of the situation and are gathering information. We will withhold comment until we know all the facts."

Calls were not immediately returned Monday from Bowers' defense attorney, Dennis Coppin.

Campbell said that if bail is posted, Bowers will be able to leave New York if he chooses. His next court date is April 25.

It was unclear Monday night whether Bowers had a permit for the gun.
