(CNN) -- It's over for Charlie Sheen and fiancÃ©e Brett Rossi.

The "Anger Management" actor called off his engagement to Rossi, a former adult film star, weeks before their November wedding, Sheen's publicist Jeffrey Ballard said.

"Scotty and I had a great year together as we traveled the world and crossed a lot of things off our bucket list," the 49-year-old actor said in a statement. "She's a terrific gal -- but we've mutually decided to go our separate ways and not spend the rest of our lives together."

The couple began publicly dating in November, and the thrice-married Sheen popped the question during a Valentine's Day getaway to Hawaii.

Why the change of heart, then?

"I've decided that my children deserve my focus more than a relationship does right now," Sheen said. "I still have a tremendous fondness for Scotty and I wish her all the best."
