Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A young boy fell to his death from a luxury suite at Los Angeles' Staples Center on Sunday night, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.

The 2-year-old boy fell from the suite around 9:15 p.m. (12:15 a.m. ET), police said in a statement. The boy was transported to the USC Medical Center, where he later died, Sgt. Frank Alvelais told CNN.

The toddler  fell a few minutes after the conclusion of a NBA game between the Los Angles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors, CNN affiliate KTLA reported.

After the game, the boy's family and others in his group were taking pictures while still in the luxury suite section of the arena, police said.

The third deck of the Staples Center -- where the luxury suite is located -- has a roughly 50-foot drop, according to KTLA.

The boy was identified by Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter as Lucas Anthony Tang. An autopsy is pending, Winter said.

Witness said the child was still moving his legs and arms as he was being put on a stretcher, KTLA reported.

Detectives said they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the boy's death.
