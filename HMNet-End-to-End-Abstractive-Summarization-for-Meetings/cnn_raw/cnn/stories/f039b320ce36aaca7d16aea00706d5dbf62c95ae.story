(CNN)  -- Barcelona's French international defender Eric Abidal will undergo emergency surgery Thursday for a liver tumor, the Spanish champions have announced.

The 31-year-old's condition was uncovered by a routine medical check after he felt unwell Tuesday.

The club said the operation would begin at 1500 GMT, having been initially scheduled Friday.

Abidal's plight has stunned his Barcelona teammates with vice-captain Xavi Hernandez speaking for many.

"This is the toughest time I've had at the club, but Abidal will get over it because mentally he's one of the toughest people I know," he told the club's official website.

Barca president Sandro Rosell said the club would do "everything within its power and more to aid his recovery."

Details about the extent of the tumor have not emerged, but, if it is benign, specialists say he could make a quick recovery after surgery.

But his illness comes at a critical part of Barcelona's season as they bid for the domestic double in Spain and to win back the Champions League crown.

Abidal played in both legs of Barcelona's Champions League last 16 win over Arsenal and has been recalled to the French international squad.

Goodwill messages have flooded in from the club's supporters and Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid's star player, also wished him a quick recovery.

"I hope that everything will be fine for Abidal and that he will return soon," he told AFP.

Meanwhile, Manchester United revealed Wednesday that their former captain Bryan Robson had surgery for throat cancer earlier this month in Bangkok..

Robson, who also captained England, is coaching Thailand and acting as an ambassador for the English Premier League giants.

The statement on their official website said he was making a good recovery and had returned to work.
