New York (CNN) -- Police arrested a Columbia University professor accused of having a three-year long sexual relationship with his daughter, officials said.

David Epstein is charged with one count of incest in the third degree, according to a statement from the Manhattan District Attorney's office.

The alleged sexual relationship between Epstein and his biological daughter -- now 24 years-old -- took place between 2006 and 2009, the statement said.

He could face four years in prison, if convicted.

His attorney Matthew Galluzzo said Epstein is innocent, claiming the charges are "unfair and unwarranted."

"He is a respected member of the academic community and wishes to thank his friends at Columbia University for their continued support throughout this ordeal," Galluzzo said.

Columbia University placed the 46-year old professor of political science on administrative leave, but declined further comment regarding the investigation, said university spokesman Robert Hornsby.

Epstein is set to appear in court on March 10.
