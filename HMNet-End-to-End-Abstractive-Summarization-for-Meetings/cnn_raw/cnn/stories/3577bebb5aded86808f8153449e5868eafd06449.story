(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney's stunning overhead kick was enough to give Manchester United a 2-1 win over arch rivals Manchester City in the English Premier League on Saturday.

Rooney's strike, only his fifth league goal of the season, means Alex Ferguson's team extend their lead over their neighbors to eight points with a game in hand on Roberto Mancini's side.

United took the lead at Old Trafford through Nani on the stroke of halftime. The Portugal winger beat Pablo Zabaleta before calmly slotting the ball past goalkeeper Joe Hart.

City equalized after 65 minutes when substitute Edin Dzeko saw his shot deflect off Spanish teammate David Silva and spin into the back of the net.
