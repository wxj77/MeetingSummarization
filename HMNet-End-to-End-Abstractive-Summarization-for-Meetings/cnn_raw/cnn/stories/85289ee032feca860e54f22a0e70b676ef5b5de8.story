President Obama has traded GOP rancor and late-fall temperatures in Washington for a golf outing with Derek Jeter at the nicest golf resort in Las Vegas.

Obama, the retired New York Yankees shortstop and two Las Vegas businessmen were playing golf at Shadow Creek, which describes itself as a "masterpiece" course "sculpted from the Nevada desert by renowned architect Tom Fazio."

"Once the domain of only a privileged few, the natural splendor of this monument to the imagination and classic golf course design stands today ready to be shared," the website says.

Obama is spending the weekend near Las Vegas after delivering a speech at a school here on Friday. He returned to Del Sol High School, where in 2013 he called on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation.

The speech was Obama's only public event scheduled for his weekend in the Nevada desert; but the mid-60s forecast and the area's preponderance of golf resorts left little question what the president would occupy himself with over the two days.

Aides have maintained that Obama's vacations aren't truly respites from work -- he brings along staff and communications equipment that ensures his job is never far away.
