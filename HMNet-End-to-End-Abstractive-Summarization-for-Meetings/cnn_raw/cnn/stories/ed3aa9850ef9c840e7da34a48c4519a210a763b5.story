(CNN) -- A third minute goal from Gonzalo Higuain gave Real Madrid a 1-0 victory over Valencia, coach Juande Ramos' first Primera Liga win since taking charge of the Spanish champions.

Gonzalo Higuain is congratulated after scoring Real Madrid's only goal against Valencia.

The win ended Madrid's run of three straight league defeats and moved them up to 29 points, nine behind leaders Barcelona -- who visit Villarreal on Sunday.

With captain Raul Gonzalez only on the bench befcause of the flu, Higuain played alone in attack, and he soon made his mark with the early goal -- the Argentine collecting Arjen Robben's pass to fire home his 11th goal of the season.

Valencia almost fell two goals behind in the 16th minute when Rafael van der Vaart struck the post with a curling drive.

Higuain had a chance to double Madrid's tally in the second-half, but his close-range shot struck the bar.

The visitors' hopes were effectively ended when captain Carlos Marchena was sent off  after picking up his second yellow card, for a foul on Robben.

The defeat, only Valencia's second of the season after also going down to Barcelona, leaves them on 30 points, just one above Madrid.
