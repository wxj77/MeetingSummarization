(CNN) -- Two-time Masters champion Bernhard Langer has withdrawn from this year's tournament after undergoing surgery on his left thumb.

The operation to repair ligament damage sustained in a cycling accident will keep Langer out of action for up to eight weeks, bringing to an end an unbroken chain of 27 appearances at the Augusta National Golf Club.

"I'm obviously disappointed that the injury occurred, but especially disappointed with such an important part of my schedule coming up, including the Masters," Langer said in a statement, PGATour.com reported.

"I do, however, appreciate the fine care of Dr. Weiland and his team, and will work hard to recover to allow me to resume play on the Champions Tour this summer."

His thumb will be in a splint for five weeks but his doctors expect him to make a full recovery.

Langer won his first Green Jacket in 1985 -- becoming only the second European player to win the tournament after Seve Ballesteros -- before going on to claim a second title in 1993.

The 53-year-old, who turned professional in 1976, has enjoyed a sparkling career winning 42 times on the European Tour.

He was also an integral part of Europe Ryder Cup team during their resurgence during the 1980s and 1990s, making a total of ten appearances as a player and one as captain in 2004 when Europe won by their biggest margin in the competition's history.

In 2007, Langer joined the PGA Champions Tour and has become one of it's most successful players winning a total of 14 titles. The most recent of these came at the ACE Group Classic in February.

Last December, Langer was crowned Champions Tour Player of the Year after claiming five titles during the 2010 season.

This year's Masters tournament gets underway on April 7.
