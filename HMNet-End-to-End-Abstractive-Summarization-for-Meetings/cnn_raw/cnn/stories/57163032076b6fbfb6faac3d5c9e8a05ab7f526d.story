(CNN Student News) -- October 28, 2014

Exactly one week from the U.S. midterm elections, political science plays a starring role in today's show. For history, science and social studies teachers, we have reports on Britain's withdrawal from Afghanistan, a dangerous lava flow in Hawaii, and the end of daylight-saving time in the U.S. A potentially new type of virtual reality and a holiday for chocolate sweeten the end of this Tuesday's program.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
