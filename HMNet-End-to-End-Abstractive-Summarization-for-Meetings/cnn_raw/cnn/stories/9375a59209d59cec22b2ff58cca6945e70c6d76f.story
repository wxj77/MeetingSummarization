(EW.com) -- Ready to feel old?

Just in time for the 20th anniversary (!!) of "Boy Meets World" premiering on ABC, all seven seasons of the show are coming to DVD as a boxed set for the first time. This means that for those who haven't yet discovered the wonders of YouTube all your favorite footage — from Adam Scott guest appearances to The Feeny Call — is all in one place. A behind-the-scenes feature "Back To the Beginning" will also be included and features the cast talking about their characters; it's not clear if this was taped recently or put together from archival footage.

If that's not enough to quench your '90s nostalgia, the entire run of "Saved By the Bell" is also coming to DVD. Relive your favorite Bayside High moments — and decide when exactly Screech was at his creepiest — when that program makes its boxed set debut. Special features include a documentary about the creation as well as featurette about how the show changed what was shown on Saturday mornings.
