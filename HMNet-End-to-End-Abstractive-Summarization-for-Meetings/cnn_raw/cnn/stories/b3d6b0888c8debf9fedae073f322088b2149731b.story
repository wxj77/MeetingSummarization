WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A man suspected in three pipe bomb attacks in Virginia was arrested in Montana Thursday after a police chase, law enforcement officials said.

Laurence Stewart II allegedly threw several pipe bombs at law enforcement officers during the pursuit. According to a press release issued by the Stafford County Virginia Sheriff's Office, officers disabled Stewart's car and he was captured as he tried to run away on foot armed with a handgun. It appears no shots were fired.

The charges against Stewart, 25, include two counts of attempted capital murder of a law enforcement officer, arson, and use of a weapon or device for an act of terror. According to Virginia law enforcement officials, Stewart targeted two Stafford County law enforcement officers and a former girlfriend in three early morning pipe bomb attacks on Tuesday. No one was injured in the incidents. Officials said that Stewart was upset by pending legal action against him.

"We're extremely blessed that no individuals were hurt in his brazen attempt to stop law enforcement and the judicial process," Richard Marianos, Special Agent in Charge of the ATF's Washington Field Division told CNN. The ATF had 50 agents working on the case along with local law enforcement.

Maj. Kenton Hickethier, a spokesman with the Montana Highway Patrol said Stewart is being detained at the Cascade County Detention Center and he did not know when he might be returned to Virginia to face charges.
