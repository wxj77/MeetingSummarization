(CNN Student News) -- November 14, 2014

About two-thirds of the U.S. is feeling our first story this Friday: Unseasonable cold, thanks to a "bomb cyclone," is dropping temperatures on the country. Science also comes into play in stories about a Hawaiian lava flow and the recent contact between a spacecraft and a comet. For social studies teachers, we've included a report about the mysterious dictator of a secretive Asian country. Fridays are fascinating on CNN Student News!

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
