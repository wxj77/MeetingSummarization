SRINAGAR, Indian-administered Kashmir (CNN) -- Six family members were buried alive after an avalanche crashed into their house in a remote village in Indian-administered Kashmir, officials said Friday.

A total of 10 people were killed Friday following five days of continuous snowfall in the mountainous region.

An avalanche in the mountainous Peth Hallan village rolled over the family's house Friday morning, engulfing it in snow, Kashmir Divisional Commissioner Mehboob Iqbal told CNN.

Indian army and police rescue teams were able to rescue only one of the seven family members in the house, he said.

Peth Hallan is about 68 miles (110 kilometers) south of Srinagar.

Another avalanche in the village of Nayal, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) from Srinagar, killed three people, including a woman, a senior police official said.

And in the village of Gulab Bagh, in north Kashmir, a third avalanche buried a house Friday morning, killing one person and injuring three, he said.

"We have so far removed to safety over 300 persons from avalanche-prone villages of Waltengo Nar and Gulab Bagh, and lodged them in makeshift rescue centers," the senior police official said.

After nearly a week of snowfall, authorities have sounded a red alert in the area, asking residents not to move out of their homes, citing the high risk of avalanches.

They are a common threat in Kashmir during winters, and scores of lives have been claimed by them this season in areas where people live along the Himalayan mountain ranges. E-mail to a friend
