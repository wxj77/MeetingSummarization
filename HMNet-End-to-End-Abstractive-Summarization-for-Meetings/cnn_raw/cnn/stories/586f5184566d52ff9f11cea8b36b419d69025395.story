MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexican police have arrested a "highly dangerous" U.S. citizen wanted on weapons charges, the Michoacan state attorney's office said.

Robert Hamlin Wainwright, 66, was arrested in tMexico at the request of the U.S. Marshal's Office.

Robert Hamlin Wainwright, 66, was arrested in the city of Zamora at the request of the U.S. Marshal's Office in Tucson, Arizona, the Mexican authorities said. He faces deportation.

A January 27 notice by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Wainwright, who has a prior felony conviction, was being investigated by the Indiana Environmental Task Force when firearms and ammunition were found at his home and business. He was tried and found guilty of firearms violations and was awaiting sentencing when he fled to Mexico, the EPA said.

Wainwright, a convicted child molester, also faces charges of discharging a pollutant into Indiana waters.

Mexican officials also announced Tuesday the arrest last month of a Canadian citizen on child pornography charges.

According to the federal Secretariat of Public Security, Arthur Leland Sayler operated 36 child pornography Web sites in the United States and Mexico.

Officials said they confiscated 29 DVDs that could house about 4 million photographs, 25 disc drives, two flash cards, nine floppy disks, 96 CD-ROMS, mobile telephone SIM cards and two Web servers.
