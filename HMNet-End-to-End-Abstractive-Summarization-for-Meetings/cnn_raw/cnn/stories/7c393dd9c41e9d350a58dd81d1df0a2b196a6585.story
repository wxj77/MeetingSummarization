(CNN) -- A pair of suicide car bombs exploded near a security checkpoint in central Baghdad Monday morning, killing at least three people and wounding 20 others, Iraq's interior ministry said.

The casualties included Iraqi security forces and civilians, according to the ministry.

The attack took place at the western entrance to the Green Zone -- a heavily fortified area which houses Iraqi government offices and many foreign embassies, including the U.S. and British embassies.
