(CNN) -- The United Arab Emirates is playing host to a huge corporate party this week. Hotel lobbies and shopping malls are flooded with Chinese guests and the Dubai-Abu Dhabi highway is dotted with long rows of buses branded "2014 Nu Skin Success Trip" in English and Arabic.

Nu Skin China, the Chinese arm of a U.S.-based marketing skin care marketing company is flying in 16,000 of its employees from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau to the UAE for a corporate trip. It says the jaunt will bring in around $20 million of business to the Gulf state.

More than 200 flights were booked for the trip, including two chartered Emirates planes, while more than 39,000 hotel beds in 40 hotels and 409 buses were required, according to Nu Skin and local travel agency Arabian Adventures.

The visitors are arriving in overlapping groups of around 2000 people a time.

The guests are visiting landmarks such as the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, and the Sheikh Zayed mosque in Abu Dhabi. The company has also booked out the massive Ferrari World theme park for three days and organized three "workshop dinners" for 8,000 people a time, according to organizers.

This year marks Nu Skin's 30th anniversary and the trip "is for the development and recognition of our top sales leaders in the Greater China region," according to a statement from the company.

Dubai bid for the jaunt in October 2012, competing against other cities including Seoul, Macau and Singapore, to play host.

In January last year the company announced its selection of Dubai as the destination for its massive trip.
