(EW.com) -- Fresh from taping the first season of FX's "Anger Management," Brett Butler has already lined up a new gig: She's going to guest star on a CBS soap!

EW has learned exclusively that Butler, the former star of the ABC comedy "Grace Under Fire," will play Beth the neighbor in an upcoming episode of "The Young and the Restless." Butler was scheduled to tape scenes with Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) yesterday and today at the CBS Studios in Los Angeles. Her episodes will air on June 12 and 14.

Butler wrapped production May 1 on "Anger Management," a new comedy in the works at FX that stars Charlie Sheen. Butler plays Brett, a friend to Charlie (Sheen) who is a bartender at his favorite watering hole, The Merry Peasant. Here's the official description of her character: "Brett dropped out of school and spent years as a stripper before becoming a bartender, and now loves to joke around with Charlie as he brings his family, dates, even his patients to the bar."

Anger Management will air on Thursday nights starting June 28. The show will be part of the cable network's new comedy block.
