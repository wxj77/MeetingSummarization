Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- An explosion at an Indonesian navy ammunition warehouse near Jakarta killed one person and injured dozens of others, authorities said.

The blast took place Wednesday morning at the warehouse on an island off the Tanjung Priok port complex in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, the military said.

Most of the 87 people injured were responding to the fire, said military spokesman Rear Adm. Iskandar Situmpol.

Situmpol said the possible cause of the explosion was an electrical short circuit that first caused a fire.
