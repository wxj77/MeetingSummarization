(CNN)  -- England wicketkeeper Matt Prior will miss the crucial fourth Test against West Indies in Barbados on Thursday after his wife gave birth to their first child, a baby boy.

England cricketer Prior dashed from the Caribbean to be with wife Emily following the birth of their first child.

Prior rushed home from the Caribbean to be with his wife Emily after hearing the news in the early hours of Monday morning.

The Sussex star was due to temporarily quit the tour on March 2, the due date for the birth, but his premature departure will give reserve wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose the chance to impress.

Prior regained his England place from Ambrose after an impressive season with the bat and gloves for his county side Sussex last season.

England are 1-0 down in the series after losing the first Test and then failing to secure victory in the third Test in Antigua as West Indies battled to a draw.

They are already without injured all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, who has a hip injury and there were doubts over off-spinner Graeme Swann, who has an elbow problem.

Meanwhile, respected West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor has announced he will quit officiating in international matches next month.

The 62-year-old Jamaican will stand in the third Test between South Africa and Australia starting on March 19 in Cape Town and his last match will be a one-day international between the West Indies and England at Barbados on March 29.

Bucknor has umpired 126 Test matches since 1989.

In cricket action on Monday, Pakistan captain Younis Khan scored a century as his side reached 296 for three wickets against Sri Lanka on the third day of the first Test in Karachi.

Khan was unbeaten on 149 at stumps as his team replied to Sri Lanka's massive 644 for seven declared.

Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera both hit  double centuries as they notched up a Test record fourth wicket partnership of 437 in their innings.
