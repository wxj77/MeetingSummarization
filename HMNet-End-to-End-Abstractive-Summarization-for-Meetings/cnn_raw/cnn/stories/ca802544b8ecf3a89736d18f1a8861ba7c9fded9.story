(CNN) -- All three women whose bodies were found wrapped in trash bags last weekend in East Cleveland have been identified, CNN has confirmed after speaking with their families. They are Angela Deskins, Shirellda Terry and Shetisha Sheeley.

Earlier, the identification of Sheeley, 28, prompted her mother to plead for prayers.

The victims were at different sites a few blocks from one another.

More questions than answers in Cleveland's run on high-profile crime

"I don't know why this person did what they did to my daughter, but I just want everybody, just pray for me. Because this is really, really hard on me right now," Kim Sheeley told CNN affiliate WEWS. "It was really hard. It's taken a toll out of me. I don't know what else to say, but thank you all for whoever is praying for me."

Wiping away tears, she said her 25-year-old son was killed in an unrelated incident in December.

The body of Deskins, 38, was found in a garage Friday, naked with indications of trauma, police say. Sheeley's body was found second, in a field, and Terry's body was in the basement of an empty home. Both were found Saturday.

East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton believes the killings happened over 10 days and were committed by the same person.

"One of the things that makes us believe it's the same suspect is the way that they were all wrapped ... and the same concealment of each of the victims," he said. "We are dealing with a sick individual, and we have reason to believe that there might be more victims."

Michael Madison, 35, was formally charged Monday in the deaths.

The garage where Deskins was found was leased to Madison, police said. A search of his apartment found "additional evidence of decomposition" there, said Detective Sgt. Scott Gardner with the East Cleveland police.

Madison was taken into custody after a standoff at his mother's house.

East Cleveland is seven miles northeast of Cleveland.
