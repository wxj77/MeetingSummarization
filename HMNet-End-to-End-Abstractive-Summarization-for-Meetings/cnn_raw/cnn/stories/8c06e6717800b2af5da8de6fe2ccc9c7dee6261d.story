Atlanta (CNN) -- Former NBA guard Javaris Crittenton is wanted in connection with the murder of an Atlanta woman, authorities said Monday.

Crittenton, 23, of Fayetteville, Georgia, faces murder charges from the August 19 shooting of 22-year-old Julian Jones in Atlanta. Jones suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at a hospital, the FBI said.

Authorities believe Jones was killed in a drive-by shooting involving a dark-colored SUV and an assault rifle.

The FBI said Crittenton probably is in Los Angeles with family and friends. He purchased a one-way plane ticket to Los Angeles five days after the shooting. He is also named in a federal arrest warrant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.

Crittenton, who played for Georgia Tech before going pro, was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2007 and then traded to the Memphis Grizzlies. He was picked up by the Washington Wizards in December 2008 but was suspended and later released by the NBA in 2010 after a gun-related incident involving teammate Gilbert Arenas.

Crittenton's representatives could not be immediately reached for comment Monday.
