(CNN) -- They came from all over, police say, and at least one carried condoms in his pocket.

A middle school teacher, a tourist visiting from Turkey, college students, a businessman from North Carolina. All of them were arrested in a week-long law enforcement operation, which ended Monday, that targeted men seeking sex with children.

About 16 Florida law enforcement agencies came together to create the ruse that the suspects were chatting online with children or parents offering up their kids for sex.

The men drove down to a pristine home in the city of Oviedo, about 19 miles from Orlando.

Footage released by authorities captured their surprise as their illicit date turned into a rough tackle by a posse of officers.

The black and white footage shows officers slamming the men against the wall of the home before cuffing them. At least one man led police on a brief footchase in the front yard before they took him down.

One of the men, authorities said, was a Florida high school English teacher who arrived at the decoy home with condoms in his pocket planning to have sex with a 14-year-old girl.

Before coming to the home, he sent photos of himself to the undercover officer, Florida detectives said.

"He said he had a lot to lose," Seminole County Maj. Dennis Lemma told reporters.

A middle school science teacher arrived, planning to have sex with a 14-year-old boy, authorities said.

Another man arrested was an elementary school interpreter for deaf children, investigators said, who had posted an online advertisement for a 13-year-old boy.

A school janitor also turned up, police said.

In all, 50 suspects where arrested. They ranged in ages of 19 to 60.
