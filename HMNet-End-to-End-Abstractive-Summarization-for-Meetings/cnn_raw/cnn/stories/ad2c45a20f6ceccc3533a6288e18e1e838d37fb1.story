(CNN) -- Eleven people were killed Tuesday during clashes with Yemeni security forces after anti-government protests again filled the streets of the country's capital, according to a hospital official.

Crowds marched through downtown Sanaa, where government forces allegedly gunned down protesters -- the latest in a series of confrontations between those loyal to embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh, demonstrators and rival factions.

Hundreds of security forces attempted to restrict the protesters' movements, and tear-gas canisters could be seen flying toward the crowd, said hospital director Mohammed Qubati.

Others carrying sticks and knives also advanced toward the crowds, Qubati added.

CNN has not independently confirmed the details of casualties, and the government has not yet responded to requests for comment.

The violence comes one day after thousands of women demonstrated in front of Yemen's Foreign Ministry in Sanaa, demanding U.N. intervention in the ongoing unrest in the Persian Gulf nation.

The women called for sanctions against Saleh and asked that the International Criminal Court try him.

Saleh said Sunday that "strong documentation of the cooperation" between al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood indicate a military coup that is destabilizing the country.

He described the opposition as "insane people, who can't sleep and only want to take power."
