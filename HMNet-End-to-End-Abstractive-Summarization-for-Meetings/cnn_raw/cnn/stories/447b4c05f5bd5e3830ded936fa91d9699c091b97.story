(CNN) -- A 10-year-old Ohio boy was taken into custody after police suspected that he shot and killed his mother with .22-caliber rifle, police said.

The body of Deborah L. McVay, 46, was found on Sunday lying face down on her living room floor in Holmesville, Ohio, some 75 miles south of Cleveland, according to Holmes County Sheriff Tim Zimmerly.

McVay was apparently killed by a single gunshot wound to the head, Zimmerly said in a statement on Monday.

She was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency personnel.

McVay's son was later brought into custody after he allegedly asked a neighbor for help, telling the neighbor that he had just shot his mother, the statement said.

Defense attorney Andrew Hyde said he entered a denial that the boy purposely killed his mother, allowing him time to investigate the incident.

"He is very emotional at this time," Hyde said. "I think he is still struggling to accept that this happened and his mother died."

The boy is being held at Richland County Juvenile Detention as police investigate the shooting, the statement said.
