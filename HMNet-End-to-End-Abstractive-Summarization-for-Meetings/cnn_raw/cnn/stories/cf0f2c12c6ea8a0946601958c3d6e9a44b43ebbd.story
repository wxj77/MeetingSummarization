The United States will provide an additional $380 million in humanitarian assistance to help those affected by the war in Syria,  Secretary of State John Kerry announced Wednesday.

"The humanitarian situation in Syria is an outrage that should offend every reasonable conscience, and the anguish of the Syrian people demands our collective action," Kerry  said at a donors' conference in Kuwait.

"The Syrian people desperately need the global community to provide urgent humanitarian support, to press for a political solution that will put a stop to the violence, once and for all."

Kerry said the latest pledge brings the total American commitment to $1.7 billion.

The money will fund relief for people inside Syria, as well as refugees and host communities in neighboring countries.

Nations taking part in Wednesday's conference pledged more than a $1.37 billion.

Here's the breakdown:

Kuwait, $500 million
