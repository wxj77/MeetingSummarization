New York (CNN) -- A peacock has flown the coop, stealthily escaping from its home at the Central Park Zoo.

The male peacock "wandered" away from the Manhattan Zoo on Tuesday, said Wildlife Conservation Society spokeswoman Mary Dixon in a statement.

The adventurous bird made its way to a Fifth Avenue apartment building near the park and perched on a third-floor window sill.

Zoo officials are encouraging onlookers to avoid following or harassing the peacock and say the runaway poses no danger to the public.

"We are hopeful he will either fly back to the zoo or we will retrieve him nearby," Dixon said in the statement.

Zoo officials did not comment on how the bird escaped or what type of enclosure he was in. According to the zoo's website, peafowl are kept in the Tisch Children's Zoo, described as a "walk-through wildlife adventure."

The peacock has drummed up more than 340 followers on its @CentralPeacock Twitter feed.

The Central Park escapee comes on the heels of a peahen -- the female counterpart to a peacock -- fleeing the Bronx Zoo in May and an even more infamous cobra, who disappeared from its Bronx Zoo pen for five days in March.
