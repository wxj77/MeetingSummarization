MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The body of an apparent stowaway fell from the wheel well of a plane taking off Thursday from the Dominican Republic, a Federal Aviation Administration official said.

The 767 aircraft -- Amerijet flight 840 -- landed about two hours later without incident at Miami International Airport. The flight originated in Santo Domingo.

FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said the FAA is investigating the incident.

According to its Web site, Amerijet is an international cargo carrier.

The plane was sent to a secure area of Miami International and was being inspected, according to the Miami-Dade Police Department.

It's unclear why the plane continued to Miami after the body fell out, rather than returning to Santo Domingo.

An Amerijet spokesperson did not immediately return a call for comment.

CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.
