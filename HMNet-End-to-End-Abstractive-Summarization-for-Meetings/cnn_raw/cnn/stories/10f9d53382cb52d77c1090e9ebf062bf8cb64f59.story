(CNN)Former Vice President Walter Mondale was released from the Mayo Clinic on Saturday after being admitted with influenza, hospital spokeswoman Kelley Luckstein said.

"He's doing well. We treated him for flu and cold symptoms and he was released today," she said.

Mondale, 87, was diagnosed after he went to the hospital for a routine checkup following a fever, former President Jimmy Carter said Friday.

"He is in the bed right this moment, but looking forward to come back home," Carter said during a speech at a Nobel Peace Prize Forum in Minneapolis.

"He said tell everybody he is doing well."

Mondale underwent treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

The 42nd vice president served under Carter between 1977 and 1981, and later ran for President, but lost to Ronald Reagan. But not before he made history by naming a woman, U.S. Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro of New York, as his running mate.

Before that, the former lawyer was  a U.S. senator from Minnesota.

His wife, Joan Mondale, died last year.
