New York (CNN) -- Talk show host Joy Behar has finally said "I do" to her beau of 29 years.

Behar, who has her own show on HLN, also voices her opinions on "The View."

She married Steve Janowitz, whom she has referred to as her "spousal equivalent."

A spokeswoman for HLN confirmed the Thursday night nuptials, saying Behar is on vacation and will discuss the wedding when she returns to her shows on September 6. After she got married, the bride tweeted: "Gone fishing."

In addition to talk shows, the multitasker has had roles on stage, and made guest appearances on the small screen and the silver screen.

Her film appearances include "Hall Pass," "Cookie," Woody Allen's "Manhattan Murder Mystery" and a cameo in "Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail."

In theater, Behar starred in the off-Broadway hit "The Food Chain" and also in the critically-acclaimed "The Vagina Monologues."

HLN's Evan Cutler contributed to this report.
