(CNN) -- Pop star Madonna suffered minor injuries Saturday when she was thrown off a horse after it was startled by photographers, her record label said.

Madonna is due to begin a European tour on July 4.

The photographers jumped out of the bushes to snap pictures of the 50-year-old singer while she was visiting friends in Bridgehampton, New York, said Liz Rosenberg of Warner Brothers Records.

She suffered minor injuries and bruises and doctors will continue to monitor her, Rosenberg said in a statement.

In 2005, Madonna broke three ribs, a hand and a collarbone after she slipped from a saddle during her 47th birthday celebrations.

The singer begins a European summer tour that kicks off in London on July 4.
