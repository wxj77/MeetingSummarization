(CNN) -- A Miami imam convicted of funneling tens of thousands of dollars to the Pakistani Taliban was sentenced Friday to 25 years in prison.

U.S. District Judge Robert Scola levied the sentence against Hafiz Khan, a U.S. citizen and Pakistani native who ran the Miami Masjid, also known as the Flager Mosque.

A jury in March found Khan, 78, guilty of four charges that accused him of supporting and conspiring to support terrorists and a terrorist organization.

The charges alleged Khan, who prosecutors said ran the Miami mosque since at least 1999, sent money and other support from the United States to the Pakistani Taliban and its supporters from at least 2008 to 2010.

The charges also accused Khan of using a madrassa, or Muslim religious school, that he founded in Pakistan to shelter and support Pakistani Taliban militants.
