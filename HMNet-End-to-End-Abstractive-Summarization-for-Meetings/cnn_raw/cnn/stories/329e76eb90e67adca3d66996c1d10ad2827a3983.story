About a month from the 2014 midterm elections House Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was already predicting a sweep for her party in the 2016 election.

Referring to Republicans, Pelosi said, "Their days are numbered.  I know that in two years there will be a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President."

Pelosi has publicly urged former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to run for president and said if Clinton does decide to run she would win.

While she was clearly looking ahead the top House Democrat was careful not to concede the election this November.  Pressed about the prediction she made earlier this summer that her party would pick up the 17 seats they would need to regain the majority in the House, Pelosi replied, "I think we will do OK."

Pelosi brushed off the negative attack ads featuring her image in several House races, but said she was "offended" by what the GOP was saying about President Barack Obama on the campaign trail.

The California Democrat seemed more than happy that Republicans are again using a strategy from previous election cycles to try and tie vulnerable House Democrats to her, remarking, "oh my goodness, they've helped me raise money every time."

Asked about her personal political plans given her confidence of a Democratic takeover on Capitol Hill, Pelosi pointed out she was already running for re-election in 2014.  But when asked whether she intended to remain in her top leadership position beyond the 2016 election, she told reporters she had to check with her husband first.
