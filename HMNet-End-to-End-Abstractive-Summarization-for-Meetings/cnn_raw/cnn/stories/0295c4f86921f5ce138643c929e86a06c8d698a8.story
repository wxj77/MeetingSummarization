(CNN) -- The Boston Bruins put down their hockey sticks on Monday and got decked out "Frozen"-style for a good cause.

Bruins defenseman Dougie Hamilton would never have been Disney's first choice for Elsa, the cartoon star of the hit "Frozen" movie. But he and forward Matt Fraser (now known as Elsa's sister, Anna) brought a bit of Halloween fun to the sick children at Boston Children's Hospital.

Rounding out the cast were Bruins defenseman Kevan Miller (Kristoff), forward Seth Griffith (Hans), defenseman Matt Bartkowski (Sven) and defenseman Torey Krug (Olaf).

"We're all fans of it. I've seen the movie, and I'm a fan so I'm not going to lie about that," Hamilton said on the team's blog. "It's fun to be able to be something that's popular and they all know it and make them smile."

It appears the movie's hit song "Let It Go" has even made its way into the players' song lists. "I've heard the song a lot of times, especially with my niece singing," Krug said. "I know the lyrics."
