(CNN) -- Porto have been sanctioned by UEFA for the "racist conduct" of their supporters during a Europa League last 32 game against Manchester City on their home ground in February.

The Portuguese club were fined 20,000 euros ($26,344) Wednesday by European football's governing body and have been given three days to appeal the punishment, a statement on UEFA official website said.

City, who won the match 2-1 at the Estadio do Dragao, complained after Yaya Toure and Mario Balotelli were the target of racist chants.

These intensified when Italian international Balotelli was substituted with 12 minutes to go.

Porto coach Vitor Pereira later claimed there the fans were actually chanting, "Hulk, Hulk, Hulk" at his club's star player, but these arguments were rejected by UEFA.

Porto were beaten 4-0 in the second leg at the Etihad Stadium and reported City fans to UEFA, claiming they had made "improper" chants at Hulk.

But UEFA took no action against City, who were knocked out of the competition by another Portuguese side, Sporting Lisbon, in the last 16.
