Istanbul (CNN) -- Two Turkish journalists who were covering news and shooting a documentary in Syria are missing, Turkey's Milat newspaper said Wednesday.

Adem Ozkose, a columnist and war reporter for Milat and the Middle East correspondent for Gercek Hayat magazine, was working for both publications in Syria, the newspaper said in a statement.

He and freelance cameraman Hamit Coskun were last heard from on Saturday, said Turgut Alp Boyraz, a member of the newspaper's foreign editorial board. The two, who went to Syria about 11 days ago, notified the paper on Saturday they had arrived in Idlib in northern Syria, the paper said.

"Their relatives have not heard from them," Boyraz said. "We are all worried about them."

Turkey's Foreign Ministry said it immediately instructed its offices to contact Syrian authorities "to formally ask about the whereabouts or any kind of information they might have about these two journalists," spokesman Selcuk Unal said.

"We are in touch with both the journal and the families. So far, Syrian authorities in Damascus have not been able to confirm anything," he said.

Turkey's consulate general contacted the governor's office in Aleppo on Tuesday night, he said, but "we have not heard anything concrete back."
