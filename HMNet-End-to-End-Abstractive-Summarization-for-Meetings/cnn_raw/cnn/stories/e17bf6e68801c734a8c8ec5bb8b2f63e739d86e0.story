(CNN) -- A roadside bomb killed 11 people in Afghanistan, including three election workers, authorities said Sunday.

The blast occurred in Samangan province late Saturday night after polls closed.

A mini bus carrying a group from a polling center to their homes hit a roadside bomb, said Sediqullah Aizizi , a spokesman for the provincial governor.

The victims had just finished the counting and other work at the polling center when the blast occurred, he said.

Before the roadside bomb, violence marred Saturday's runoff between former Foreign Affairs Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani.

The Afghan Interior Ministry said 46 people were killed on election day, including civilian and security forces.
