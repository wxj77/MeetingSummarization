CARDIFF, Wales -- Former Wales and British Lions center Ray Gravell has died of a suspected heart attack aged 56, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has announced.

Gravell won 23 caps for Wales and played on the Lions tour of South Africa in 1980.

Gravell had been on holiday with his family in the Spanish Mediterranean island of Mallorca at the time.

A WRU statement praised Gravell as being "a man who epitomized the passion, flair and dignity of his beloved Welsh nation."

Gravell made his debut for Wales against France in 1975, three years after helping his club side Llanelli to their famous win over the touring All Blacks.

In all he made 23 appearances for what was then a dominant Wales side, winning Grand Slams in 1976 and 1978, and played all four Tests on the Lions' tour of South Africa in 1980.

After retiring as a player in 1985, Gravell became president of Llanelli RFC and the Llanelli Scarlets. He also pursued a career as an actor and a respected rugby broadcaster.

Earlier this year, Gravell had his right leg amputated below the knee following complications linked with his diabetes but he had been recovering well.

WRU chief executive Roger Lewis said: "We are all in total shock because Ray was so full of life even through the difficult health problems he suffered recently.

"He was a wonderful ambassador for rugby and for Wales and a great example of how the game can bring out the best in a man.

"As a player, he always gave a huge amount of respect to his opponents but never gave an inch of ground to anyone he faced on the field of play.

"It is a measure of the man that he forged rugby friendships which lasted long after his playing days up until the present day." E-mail to a friend
