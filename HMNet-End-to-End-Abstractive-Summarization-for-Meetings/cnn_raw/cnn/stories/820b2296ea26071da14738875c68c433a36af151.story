(CNN Student News) -- April 4, 2014

On today's show, we report on a shooting at a U.S. Army base in Texas. We also continue our Financial Literacy Month coverage by explaining what it means to default on a student loan. And oceanography factors in to this program, as we define gyres and how they collect trash where people have never set foot.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, and a place for you to leave feedback.
