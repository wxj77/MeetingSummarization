(CNN) -- "God bless you, mami."

"Hey baby."

"DAMN."

"You don't wanna talk?"

This is just a sampling of what one woman in jeans and a T-shirt experienced in 10 hours of walking through the streets of New York City. Her experience was filmed and edited into a 1:56 public service announcement for anti-street-harassment group Hollaback!

Have you been harassed? Share your experience in an open letter

Inspired by the experiences of his girlfriend, shooter Rob Bliss reached out to Hollaback! to partner on the PSA highlighting the impact of street harassment. For 10 hours, he walked with a camera in his backpack in front of Shoshana B. Roberts, as she carried two microphones in her hands.

How should men approach women?

Street harassment disproportionately impacts women, people of color, LGBTQ individuals, and young people, the group says on its website: "Although the degree to which Shoshana gets harassed is shocking, the reality is that the harassment that people of color and LGBTQ individuals face is oftentimes more severe and more likely to escalate into violence."

Where are the world's most dangerous transit systems for women?

Within hours of the video being posted to YouTube, commenters began posting threatening remarks, prompting Hollaback! to request help policing the video.
