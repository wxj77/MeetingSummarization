(CNN) -- Manchester City announced a deal with Etihad Airways on Friday which will see the English football club rename their home stadium.

As a result of the 10-year agreement, the Premier League team's ground will be called the Etihad Stadium and large parts of the surrounding area will now be known as the Etihad Campus.

The Abu Dhabi-based airline has also extended its shirt sponsorship deal with last season's FA Cup winners, which began in May 2009.

"The City of Manchester Stadium will be renamed the Etihad Stadium effective immediately," read a statement on the club's official web site.

"Etihad Airways has extended its shirt sponsorship deal reflecting an increased media value due to the club's improved on-pitch performance in the 2010-11 season."

Roberto Mancini's team achieved a third-place finish in the domestic table, qualifying for the European Champions League for the first time in the club's history.

The FA Cup triumph represented City's first trophy in 35 years.

City's chief executive officer Gary Cook hailed the agreement as a sign of the team's continued development.

"We are delighted to be expanding our relationship with Etihad Airways through this comprehensive partnership agreement," he said.

"Most importantly, in addition to delivering significant revenue at a key stage in the club's evolution, the agreement creates exciting opportunities for our two organizations to cooperate more deeply commercially and on media and community initiatives in the future."

The deal with Etihad has seen the two-time English champions further strengthen their links with the United Arab Emirates, after the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan in August 2008.

On the pitch, City this week completed the signings of France left-back Gael Clichy from Arsenal and Serbia defender Stefan Savic from Partizan Belgrade.
