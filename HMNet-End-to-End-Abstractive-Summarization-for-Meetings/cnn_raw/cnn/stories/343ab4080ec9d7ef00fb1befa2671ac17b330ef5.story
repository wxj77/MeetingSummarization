(CNN) -- Flash floods caused by persistent heavy rains in Oklahoma have claimed the life of a 13-year-old girl, the state medical examiner's office told CNN Friday morning.

The unidentified teenager went missing on Thursday after playing with friends at a drainage ditch in the Durant area, according to Cherokee Ballard, the office's spokeswoman. Durant is less than two hours north of Dallas, Texas.

Heavy rains have battered the Oklahoma area in recent days.

A dramatic rescue captured Thursday in Oklahoma City by a CNN affiliate camera crew showed firefighters trudge through waist-high muddy floodwater to grab a trapped motorist out of his submerged car.

Oklahoma Battalion Fire Chief Brian Stanaland said the motorist did not need medical attention.

The girl is the third child to be swept away in Oklahoma flooding in less than a week. Rescuers searched for a 13-year-old boy earlier this week who they feared had drowned after falling into a creek swollen by heavy rains.

Emergency crews Tuesday were able to fish a 14-year-old boy who fell into Lightning Creek out of the rushing waters, said Cecil Clay, chief of the Oklahoma City Fire Department.

A flash flood warning remained in effect in several central Oklahoma counties Friday, the National Weather Service said.

CNN's Rick Martin and Divina Mims contributed to this report.
