(CNN) -- Narayanan Krishnan brings hot meals daily to India's homeless and destitute. Since 2002, the chef has served more than 1.2 million meals through his nonprofit organization, Akshaya Trust.

Below are Krishnan's thoughts about being selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero for 2010.

Q: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero?

Narayanan Krishnan: It was around 7:15 p.m. when I got a call from CNN. ... I had just finished the evening food distribution. I [was] flying, I'm thrilled. You are giving me the biggest gift in this world.

Getting nominated itself is big recognition. All the CNN Heroes ... are doing a phenomenal job. Short listing from this elite panel of judges definitely makes me feel happy.

Q: What do you hope this will mean to Akshaya Trust?

Krishnan: This exposure will make Akshaya Trust more visible globally. Recognition from a trustworthy media source like CNN adds to our credibility. The work done for over eight years in one corner of the globe will now reach millions of people in different parts of the world. At the same time, this puts greater responsibility and accountability on us. ... We have to maintain our standards to be worthy of the recognition.

Q: What do you want people to know most about your work?

Krishnan: Human suffering is happening all the time all over the world. Everyone has their own moments of happiness and suffering -- the wheel keeps moving all the time. If we understand this ... we will become softer in our attitude toward the less fortunate and extend a helping hand.
