(CNN Student News) -- October 17, 2013

After weeks of accusations and negotiations, U.S. congressional leaders announced a temporary deal to end the partial government shutdown and raise the U.S. debt ceiling. On Thursday, CNN Student News reports on how long the plan would last. We also discuss cyberbullying, the end of a Macy's Thanksgiving policy, and the reaction to one soldier's inspiring salute. Plus, a massive fish spawns ideas for scientific research.
