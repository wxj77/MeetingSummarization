(EW.com ) -- Is this the face of a beautiful prima ballerina who burns for her beautiful brother — and yearns for revenge against her equally beautiful mother?

Lifetime thinks so.

EW can confirm that 26-year-old Rose McIver will star as Cathy in "Petals on the Wind," the network's upcoming sequel to its hit adaptation of V.C. Andrews's "Flowers in the Attic." McIver will inherit the role from Kiernan Shipka, who played Cathy from ages 12 through 15 in the first film. The novel on which Petals is based picks up immediately where Flowers leaves off, covering a sequence of events that take place over the course of 12 years; Lifetime's movie version will take a different approach, beginning a decade after the events of the first movie. (Which is a good thing, since it means viewers will be spared scenes of Sally Draper seducing a 40-year-old man.)

McIver, a New Zealand native, may be known best to American audiences as Vivian Scully on Showtime's "Masters of Sex" or Tinker Bell on ABC's "Once Upon a Time." As her Facebook page notes, McIver also used to study ballet and jazz dance — which may come in handy when playing dancer-turned-teacher Cathy.

She joins returning "Flowers" cast members Heather Graham and Ellen Burstyn, who will reprise their roles Cathy's wicked mother and grandmother, respectively.
