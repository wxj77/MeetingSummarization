(CNN) -- FACETIME: Ahmed El Borai, former Egyptian Minister of Labor
Providing employment for the rising number of young people in the region is a huge challenge for governments -- and was the key focus at the 39th Arab Labor Conference in Cairo.

MME caught up with former Egyptian Minister of Labor Ahmed El Borai to discuss what needs to be done to tackle the issue. 

IN FOCUS: Private-sector push
As concern over high unemployment continues to grow in the region, it is hoped that the private sector could pave the way for new job creation. Entrepreneurial spirit is relatively low in the region --- but MME investigates one initiative hoping to give private investors a boost.
