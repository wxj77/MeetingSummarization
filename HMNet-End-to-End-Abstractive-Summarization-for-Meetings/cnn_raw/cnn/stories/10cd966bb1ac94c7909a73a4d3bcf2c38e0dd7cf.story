(CNN) -- Chinese authorities were explicit: Tear down the nation's first sex-themed amusement park before it gets going full steam.

Visitors catch a glimpse of Love Land, billed as China's first-ever sex theme park, in southwest China.

Love Land had not opened its doors yet, but authorities in the city of Chongqing -- a sprawling metropolis on the banks of the Yangtze River -- got all hot and bothered over the park's plans to display naked human sculptures, giant replica genitals and a photo gallery on the history of sex, the state-run China Daily reported.

Lu Xiaoqing, park manager, told the newspaper he got the idea for building Love Land after a visit to a sex park in Jeju, a popular destination in South Korea.

Love Land would include sex-technique workshops and sex education to help adults "enjoy a harmonious sex life," Lu said.

"Sex is a taboo subject in China, but people really need to have more access to information about it," he told the newspaper. "We are building the park for the good of the public."

Whatever Lu's intentions, the newspaper said Chinese officials saw it another way: "vulgar, ill-minded and misleading."

The park was to open in October but was demolished over the weekend -- thongs, replicas of derrieres and all.

Reactions posted on the Internet were varied, according to the China Daily. Some thought sex was best left behind closed doors, while others argued that a real need for sex education existed in China.

"Sex is a matter of privacy. It is not for publicity," said Xia Xueluan, a sociology professor at Beijing University.

The officials in Chongquing apparently agreed.
