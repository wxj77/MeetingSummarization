Since the days of Hemingway and Faulkner, bars and cafes where writers, painters and performance artists go to procrastinate have often caught the public's imagination.

The romance of the artist's hangout is irresistible.

From rivalries fermented over drinks to witty one-liners exchanged by Dorothy Parker and her well read pals -- "Their pooled emotions wouldn't fill a teaspoon" -- these are the places of a struggling artist's networking dreams.

Even better, some of the most iconic artist hangouts and literary pubs continue to welcome patrons today.

Hemingway wrote "Fiesta" here.

The snug at Toners, a private lounge-like area typical of a traditional Irish pub, is the place where the old Irish literati hung out.

The snug was named Snug of the Year in 2010.
