(CNN) -- There was more heartbreak for Britain's Queen Elizabeth II Friday as her horse Bold Sniper was beaten in the Wolferton Stakes on Royal Ascot's fourth day.

Ed Dunlop's Contributor claimed victory to deny the Queen and extend her losing run at the festival.

On Thursday, her filly Estimate narrowly failed in her bid to defend her Gold Cup title when she was overhauled by Leading Light in the final stages.

"I've had so many seconds here I thought it was never going to happen, but it's fantastic to win one," George Baker, who rode Contributor to victory, told reporters.

"This horse ran on very heavy ground at Sandown behind Noble Mission. If he hadn't run there, he'd have been a lot shorter in the betting.

In the day's feature race, the Coronation Stakes, Rizeena delivered for trainer Clive Brittain, striking the front under Ryan Moore.

Hartnell proved victorious in the Queen's Vase, while Louis The Pious caused a 33-1 shock in the Buckingham Palace Stakes.

"That was great. I've been here for the last three days and I'm just glad to ride a winner," Silvestre de Sousa, who rode Louis The Pious, told reporters.

"I felt they went pretty quick. He gave me a great ride. He was off the bridle the whole way but he was comfortable at his speed.

"When I asked him to quicken up, he picked up too well, but he kept rolling and thank God he got there."
