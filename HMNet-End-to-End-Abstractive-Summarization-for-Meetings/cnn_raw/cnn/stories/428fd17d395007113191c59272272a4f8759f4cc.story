(CNN) -- Argentina striker Sergio Aguero may have scored two goals as a second-half substitute on his Manchester City debut, but the club's manager Roberto Mancini maintained the 23-year-old has yet to regain his full fitness.

City opened their English Premier League campaign on Monday with a 4-0 victory over top-flight newcomers Swansea City, with Aguero netting a brace after replacing Nigel de Jong on 60 minutes.

Italian coach Mancini said Aguero, who joined City from Atletico Madrid for a club-record fee in July, was short of peak fitness because of his appearances for Argentina at the recent Copa America.

"I think he needs more training," Mancini, 46, told the Citizen's official web site. "He's trained for only one week with the team. I think he needs to recover after the Copa America because I don't think he's 100%."

Aguero double in Manchester City debut

City took the lead through Bosnia's Edin Dzeko after 57 minutes, before Aguero scored his first when he swept home a Micah Richards cross from close range 11 minutes later.

The former Independiente forward then assisted Spain's David Silva for City's third goal, before completing the scoring with a stunning 25-yard strike in injury time.

"A better debut than this I don't think is possible," reflected Mancini. "He played 30 minutes, scored two goals, two important goals which closed the match."

Mancini said it was important for the team to bounce back after they surrendered a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 against cross-city rivals Manchester United in the Community Shield, a preseason friendly that starts the English football season.

"I'm very happy for the supporters because after the Community Shield it was important to start the season very well.

"Silva, Aguero, Dzeko, Yaya Toure all played very, very well. But I think all the team started the season very well."

The 2011 FA Cup winners City will play their first away match of the season at Bolton Wanderers on Sunday.
