Srinagar, India (CNN) -- The Indian army said it gunned down five militants and foiled an infiltration bid near the border line that divides Kashmir between the nation and Pakistan.

Troops thwarted the bid Thursday after they saw six militants trying to enter near Uri area in north Kashmir, military officials said.

"On being asked to surrender, the infiltrators opened heavy fire on our troops," said Lt Col. J. S. Brar, a defense spokesman. "The troops retaliated resulting in the killing of five terrorists."

Brar said troops recovered four bodies of the militants, rifles and ammunition at the scene.

"The body of the fifth terrorist is yet to be recovered as the area of operation is in very close proximity to the Line of Control," he said. "Identity of the slain terrorists is yet to be established."

Troops are vigilant to thwart such attempts near the Line of Control, he said. The line marks the de-facto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.
