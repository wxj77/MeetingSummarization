(CNN)The irrepressible Mario Balotelli has a message for his critics: "shut up!"

Liverpool's Italian international has started only one game since November, scoring just four goals in 24 appearances for the Anfield club after his $23 million move from AC Milan. He missed their 1-0 away win over Swansea City on Monday due to illness.

Perhaps a bit fed up, he posted a video on his Instagram page giving the world a piece of his mind.

"Do you know me?" asks the 24-year-old Balotelli, looking directly into the camera. "Did you ever talk to me, personally?

"Do you know what I've been through in my life?

"You just saw me play football on the pitch so, man, shut up."

In December, Mario Balotelli was banned for one match and fined Â£25,000 after being found guilty of breaching English Football Association rules by posting a controversial image of Super Mario on Instagram.

Balotelli's had reposted a Nintendo character Super Mario image that underneath had the words "jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a jew."
