(CNN) -- Representatives of India and Pakistan on Tuesday will hold the second day of two-day talks on conventional and nuclear weapons, Indian officials said.

No major developments were expected from the high-level talks, which are being held in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. But the discussions are aimed at building confidence between the two nuclear powers, according to a statement from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.

Dialogue will help the countries understand each other's nuclear doctrine, Pakistan's state-run agency cited foreign office spokesman Abdul Basit as saying.

India and Pakistan have fought three wars since the partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947. Two of them were over Kashmir, which is claimed by both countries.

Earlier this year, New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to resume peace talks frozen by the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. India blamed Pakistani militants for the strike that killed more than 160 people in its financial capital.

In July, both nations vowed they would not allow their relationship to slide backward again.

In 2004, the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues, including Kashmir, terrorism and Pakistan's concerns over river dams on the Indian side of the border. Pakistan sees them as a threat to its water supplies.
