(CNN) -- Christine McVie hasn't ventured out on tour with Fleetwood Mac in 15 years, but she's ready to get back on the road.

Starting September 30, all five members of Fleetwood Mac -- McVie, her ex-husband John McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood -- are launching a tour called "On With The Show."

The trek will begin in Minneapolis and will then stretch across North America with 34 shows in 33 cities.

A rep for the legendary band confirmed in January that McVie was rejoining the group after her departure in 1998, and hinted that a tour was in the works.

Over the years, McVie's had a number of reasons for her exit, including the fact that she missed her native England. But on the "Today" show Thursday, she also admitted that it was a persistent fear that got in the way.

"I had a fear of flying," she said. "I haven't flown for 15 years."

A keyboardist and singer, McVie joined Fleetwood Mac after original guitarist Peter Green left in 1970; she was married to bassist John McVie at the time.

By 1975, the McVies and drummer Fleetwood added two more members to the group: Nicks and Buckingham. The chemistry and talent among the five gave us albums like "Rumours" and "Mirage," and established Fleetwood Mac as one of the most successful bands in pop music -- even as the band members themselves weathered personal storms.

After Christine McVie left in the '90s, the group soldiered on with touring and new music as a foursome. Yet when Fleetwood Mac went to London last fall for a performance, they got Christine McVie to join them on stage for a rendition of "Don't Stop."

For her, it helped spark a pivotal moment that would inspire her to return to Fleetwood Mac.

"Walking out in London was sensational," she said on "Today," adding that she's rejoined Fleetwood Mac with a "definite capital yes."

Tickets to Fleetwood Mac's upcoming tour go on sale to the general public on April 7.
