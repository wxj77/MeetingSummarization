(CNN) -- Red Bull has appealed Daniel Ricciardo's disqualification from last weekend's Australian Grand Prix, the first round of the Formula One season.

The Australian driver, making his debut for the all-conquering team, crossed the line in second place before learning of his expulsion.

The International Automobile Federation says it will hear the appeal on April 14, the Monday before the fourth race of the season takes place in China.

Race stewards found that Ricciardo's car exceeded the sport's "fuel-flow" limit during the maiden race of 2014.

The limit was introduced in an attempt to make the sport more fuel efficient. Each car is limited to 100kg of fuel per race.

Red Bull has cast doubt over the equipment used by F1's governing body the FIA to measure fuel-flow, despite its manufacturers Gil Sensors receiving "positive feedback" from the FIA.

"Inconsistencies with the FIA fuel flow meter have been prevalent all weekend up and down the pit lane," Red Bull said after Sunday's race.

"The ream and Renault (Red Bull's engine suppliers) are confident the fuel supplied to the engine is in full compliance with the regulations."

A statement on F1's official website read: "Red Bull's appeal will now be processed by the FIA, who will then set a date for its hearing."

Sunday's race was won by Mercedes' Nico Rosberg, with McLaren rookie Kevin Magnussen taking second place in Ricciardo's absence with his teammate Jenson Button in third.

The drivers will next be on the grid for the Malaysian Grand Prix, which takes place on March 30.
