(CNN) -- Manchester City moved to within four points of neighbors and English Premier League leaders Manchester United on Saturday with a comfortable 2-0 win over Fulham at the Etihad Stadium.

City made light work of Martin Jol's side with David Silva scoring in each half. The Spanish midfielder opened City's account after only 95 seconds pouncing on a loose ball after Fulham keeper Mark Schwarzer could only parry Edin Dzeko's long-range effort.

Silva's second came midway through the second half, this time meeting a pass from Gael Clichy before lifting the ball over Schwarzer.
