(CNN) -- Ohio: The Buckeye state gave us Katie Holmes, Halle Berry, and LeBron James. And the Midwestern state is also home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Wright Brothers, the Ohio State Buckeyes and eight presidents.

If those don't put Ohio on your map, then consider the state is heavily contested on this year's electoral map. With 18 votes up for grabs, the battleground state is now polling in favor of President Obama. A recent Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll shows Obama leading Republican challenger, Mitt Romney 50%-44% in the state. Sixty-percent of the population was also found "strongly supporting" Obama in the poll, compared to 42% who said the same for Romney in the Buckeye state.

Here's a look, by the numbers, at a state that could help decide this year's election.
