(CNN) -- A former B-2 Bomber engineer has been sentenced to 32 years in prison for selling secret defense designs to China.

Noshir Gowadia, 66, of Maui, Hawaii, was sentenced late Monday for sharing classified defense information with China, illegally exporting military technical data, money laundering, filing false tax returns and other offenses.

"Mr. Gowadia provided some of our country's most sensitive weapons-related designs to the Chinese government for money," said David Kris, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's National Security Division.

"He is now being held accountable for his actions," Kris said. "This prosecution should serve as a warning to others who would compromise our nation's military secrets for profit."

Gowadia worked as an engineer with Northrop Grumman Corporation for about 17 years, according to evidence at his trial. There he helped develop features for the B-2 Spirit Bomber, also known as the "Stealth Bomber."

Between July 2003 and June 2005, Gowadia made six trips to China to provide design, data analysis and test support services needed to develop a stealthy exhaust nozzle for a cruise missile system, according his trial evidence.

Prosecutors said Gowadia pocketed at least $110,000 from China.

A federal jury in Honolulu convicted Gowadia last August.

Last Friday, a Michigan man was sentenced to a four-year prison term for conspiring to provide national defense information to Chinese intelligence officials, according to the Justice Department.

Glenn Duffie Shriver, 28, pleaded guilty in October to one count of conspiracy.
