(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy said its guided missile destroyer collided with a Japanese-owned oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz early Sunday morning.

No one was injured in the collision that occurred about 1 a.m. local time when the USS Porter collided with the Panamanian-flagged bulk oil tanker M/V Otowasan, the Navy said in a statement.

The Navy did not provide details about the collision, saying only the accident was not related to combat. It said the incident is under investigation.

Damage to the USS Porter was being evaluated, "but the ship is able to operate under its own power," the statement said.

The Navy did not say what, if any, damage the Otowasan incurred in the collision.

The USS Porter, in the Persian Gulf on a scheduled deployment, is assigned to the U.S. 5th Fleet. It is conducting maritime security operations, the Navy said.
