(CNN) -- Substitute Mario Balotelli scored a second-half equalizer to earn Inter Milan a 1-1 draw at Parma in their re-arranged Italian Serie A match on Wednesday.

Balotelli fired home from close range on the hour mark, just two minutes after coming off the bench, after the Parma defence failed to clear a corner.

On-loan Manchester City forward Valeri Bojinov had put the home side ahead in the 54th minute, the goal also coming from a corner that was not cleared properly.

Parma played the final 18 minutes with just 10 men after having Francesco Valiani dismissed for a second yellow card.

Inter are now unbeaten in nine matches and have increased their lead at the top of the table to nine points from Roma, with city rivals AC Milan another two points further back in third place.

Meanwhile, in Germany, Bayern Munich and Schalke joined Werder Bremen in the semifinals of the German Cup with victories on Wednesday.

Bayern thumped Greuther Furth 6-2 while Schalke had a narrow 1-0 win at Osnabruck.

They are joined in the last four by second division side Augsburg, who claimed a 2-0 vsuccess over Cologne.

And in Spain, Sevilla are through to the Copa del Rey final despite a narrow 1-0 defeat Getafe.

Roberto Soldado's 53rd minute goal separated the sides, but Sevilla reach the final courtesy of their 2-0 first leg success.

They are now likely to face Atletico Madrid in the final, with the capital side facing Racing Santander in Thursday's other semifinal with a 4-0 first leg lead.
