LONDON, England (CNN) -- Managing expenses on the road doesn't have to be a struggle, even in the most expensive city in the world. And what Oslo loses in costliness, it easily makes up with nature.

The city sits on the innermost part of the Oslo Fjord, with forested hills, more than 40 islands and 343 lakes. For the best views catch a ferry from Vippetangen. Or better still take a cruise.

The Oslo Pass, that provides access to 33 museums as well as free travel on public transport, also offers a free lunch cruise on board a traditional wooden sailing ship. You get a Norwegian prawn buffet as part of the deal and two-hour trip around the city's islands and lakes. Boats leave at 10.30, 13.00 and 15.30. (http://www.norwayyachtcharter.com/).

Oslo's most visited site is Vigeland Park that houses more than 200 huge, some say Rodin-esque, sculptures by celebrated Norwegian artist Gustav Vigeland. The park is 2km from the city center and it's open seven days a week. It's also free.

Other free museums and attractions include the Nasjonalgalleriet with one of the original series of Edvard Munch's The Scream; the Astrup Fearnley museum for modern art with its own Damien Hirst; and the botanical gardens.

To reward a day's cost cutting, and for the best sunset in town, try a seafood platter at restaurant, Solsiden (SÃ¸ndre Akershus Kai 34, phone 23-33-36-30).

It may not be the cheapest spot in town, but the evening sunset is worth the extra cost. The restaurant opens onto a pier looking over the Aker Brygge complex, a former shipyard area and now a hub for restaurants and bars. But this is a summer spot only, and closes between September and April.
