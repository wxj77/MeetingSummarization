(CNN) -- All-time major record holder Jack Nicklaus believes that Tiger Woods will return to the golf course in time to appear in next month's Masters.

Woods, 34, has been out of the game since revelations about his private life were made public late last year but Nicklaus is of the opinion that his fellow- American will want to play at Augusta as he aims to add to his tally of 14 major victories.

Speaking to the media before this week's Honda Classic PGA tournament, Nicklaus, who is four ahead of Woods with 18 major wins, said: "It would surprise me if he didn't play at Augusta. My guess, as a golfer, is that he will want to.

"His personal life is his personal life. He is a professional golfer and he is a sensational golfer. He is a great athlete, and he'll figure out his own problems."

Meanwhile, Woods' caddie Steve Williams has told New Zealand's 60 Minutes program that he would have spoken out about the world number one's alleged affairs if he had known about them.

"In some people's perception, I'm involved in it and I've committed a crime or I've done wrong," Williams said. "The truth is I knew nothing of what was happening."

"It's been the most difficult time of my life because every single person believed that I should know, or did know, or had something to do with it. "If I had known something was going on, the whistle would have been blown.

"Of course I'm mad at him. I'm close with his wife  -- he's got two lovely children and he's let them down. But when a guy's having a tough time, it's not up to me to beat him with a stick.
