(CNN) -- There is good news and bad news for CeeLo Green fans.

The "Crazy" singer says he will not be returning to NBC's competition show "The Voice," but fans may still be able to catch him in other projects. Green told Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show Wednesday that he will miss being on the singing series.

"I'm going to continue my relationship with NBC," he said. "I have a television show development deal with them as well and hopefully some other talk show opportunities for later in the year. But yeah, I'm going to miss 'The Voice' too."

Green appeared on the talk show along with singer Lionel Richie, with whom he will be touring. Green has continued to make music while on "The Voice," and like many fans, DeGeneres thought he was only taking a break from his mentoring duties on the show.

But it turns out Green is not coming back to the show at all.

"I don't want to wear out my welcome there," he said. "I have so many other things I want to do."

Green also posted a message to fans on on his website.

"The Voice has been an immensely enjoyable experience for me and I can only hope I have enriched the lives of our viewers, the contestants, and the many friends I made there," the message said. "I will always be there in spirit. Meanwhile, NBC and I plan to continue our relationship with several new co-ventures including a new music show, while we also explore our ideas for me to create and host a new show of my own."

In addition to reportedly working on a new album, the singer has had some legal woes.

In October, Green pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of giving the drug ecstasy to a woman who had accused him of sexually assaulting her. Prosecutors declined to pursue rape charges, but the drug case is pending.
