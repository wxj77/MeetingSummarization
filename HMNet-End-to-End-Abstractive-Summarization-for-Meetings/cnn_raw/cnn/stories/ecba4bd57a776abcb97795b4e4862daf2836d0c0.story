LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Brazilian model Gisele Bundchen married National Football League star Tom Brady Thursday in an "intimate" sunset ceremony, US Weekly magazine reported on its Web site.

Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen attend a Metropolitan Museum of Art gala May 5, 2008, in New York City.

The couple wed at a Catholic church in Santa Monica, California, in front of mostly immediate family members, the entertainment magazine reported.

The two had dated since 2006.

The bride wore a Dolce & Gabbana gown. Her three dogs, which attended the ceremony, wore matching Dolce & Gabbana floral lace collars, the Web site said.

Bundchen, 28, is the highest-paid model in the world, the business Web site Forbes.com reported last year.

New England Patriots quarterback Brady has gone to the Super Bowl four times, winning three of those games.
