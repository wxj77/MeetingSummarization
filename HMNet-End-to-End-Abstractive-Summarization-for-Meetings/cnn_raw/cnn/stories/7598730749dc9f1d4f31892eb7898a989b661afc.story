Police in Argentina arrested at least 120 people Sunday after a World Cup celebration in downtown Buenos Aires got out of hand, state news agency Telam reported.

Fans had gathered to celebrate Argentina's best performance in the World Cup in almost a quarter century.

The celebrations went on peacefully without incident until a few hours later when dozens of rowdy vandals smashed shop windows, ransacked a theater, beat up journalists and attacked police officers with bottles and rocks, local media reported.

Police fired water cannons and tear gas in response.

Fifteen police officers and at least five others were injured in the clashes, Telam said.

Even though Argentina lost to Germany 1-0 in extra time, it was the first time the team made it to the World Cup final since 1990. And its star player, Lionel Messi, won the Golden Ball, given to the best player of the tournament.

"The boys gave everything," one man said. "They put their souls into the game. But this time, it didn't happen. We are very happy."
