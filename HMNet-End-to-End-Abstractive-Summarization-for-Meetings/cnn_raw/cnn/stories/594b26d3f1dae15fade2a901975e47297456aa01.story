Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese police have arrested a man after the dismembered body of a missing six-year-old girl was found in several plastic bags near her home in Kobe City.

Through DNA testing, police identified the remains as those of first-grade student Mirei Ikuta, missing since September 11, police from Hyogo prefecture told CNN.

The remains were found Tuesday afternoon by police searching bush near the girl's home.

Police said a 47-year-old local man, Yasuhiro Kimino, was arrested Wednesday afternoon in relation to the disposal of the body.

Local media reported the man's hospital ID card had been found in the bags.

Japanese news agency Kyodo quoted an investigation source as saying the bags, one containing the victim's head and another the victim's hand, was found about 100 meters from her family home in central Japan.

Local media reported Mirei was last seen at her grandmother's house on September 11, before leaving to see a friend.
