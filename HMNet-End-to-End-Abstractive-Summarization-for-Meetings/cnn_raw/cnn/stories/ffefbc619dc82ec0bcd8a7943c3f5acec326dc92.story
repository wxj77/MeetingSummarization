(CNN) -- Mexican authorities are offering a $1.2 million (15 million pesos) reward for information on 14 children who may have been taken from orphanages by child traffickers, according to a release from the attorney general of Mexico.

The attorney general also is offering about $400,000 (5 million pesos) in the search for three people in the "Casitas del Sur" case, a statement said Friday.

The children disappeared in February 2009 from the Casitas del Sur orphanage in Mexico City and from homes in Nuevo Laredo and Quintana Roo, the statement said.

CNN's Claudia Dominguez contributed to this report.
