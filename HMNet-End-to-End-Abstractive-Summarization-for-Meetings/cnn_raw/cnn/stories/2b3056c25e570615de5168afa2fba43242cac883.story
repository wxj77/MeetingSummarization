(CNN) -- The man accused in Tuesday's shooting at Purdue University was found sitting in a hallway, bloody and with his hands behind his head, authorities said in documents filed Thursday supporting a murder charge.

Cody Cousins, 23, is accused of killing teaching assistant Andrew Boldt in front of several people in the school's electrical engineering building.

Authorities say Boldt was stabbed and shot. Investigators recovered a handgun, spent bullet casings and a knife, according to an affidavit that accompanies the formal charge of murder filed Thursday in Tippecanoe Superior Court.

Cousins was scheduled to appear in court on Thursday for an initial hearing.

Boldt will be buried on Tuesday.

Authorities have not disclosed a motive.
