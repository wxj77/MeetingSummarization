Jerusalem (CNN) -- Clashes erupted overnight at a West Bank refugee camp, authorities said Monday.

Official accounts of the fighting at the Kalandia refugee camp differed.

The Palestinian Authority said two Palestinians were killed when Israeli soldiers opened fire. The Israeli military said officials had received a report of two Palestinians injured during the violence, adding that officials were investigating.

Hospital officials in Ramallah told CNN that two men were killed and one was injured in the clashes.

Officials said the violence started during an arrest operation at the camp.

Palestinian Authority spokeswoman Cairo Arafat said people at the refugee camp tried to stop soldiers from making the arrest.

An Israeli military spokesman said "massive" disorder erupted during the arrest operation. Five soldiers were injured by rocks thrown at them, the spokesman said.

CNN's Guy Azriel contributed to this report.
