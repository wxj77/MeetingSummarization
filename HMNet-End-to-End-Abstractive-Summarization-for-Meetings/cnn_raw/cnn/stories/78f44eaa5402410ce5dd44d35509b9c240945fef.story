(CNN) -- A firefighter missing for eight days was found dead on Friday in New Mexico's Santa Fe National Forest, authorities said.

Token Adams, a firefighter with the U.S. Forest Service, apparently died in an all-terrain vehicle crash, New Mexico State Police announced at a news conference Friday.

Adams was last seen August 30, riding an ATV to investigate a possible fire in the Holiday Mesa area, according to John Helmich, a spokesman with the Forest Service.

More than 250 people had searched for the 41-year-old former Navy Seal, Helmich said.

The state police are investigating the crash.
