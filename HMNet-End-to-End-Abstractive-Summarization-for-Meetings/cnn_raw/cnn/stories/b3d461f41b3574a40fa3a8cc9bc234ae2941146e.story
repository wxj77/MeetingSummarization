(Rolling Stone) -- So here's the great pop album everybody was hoping Adam Lambert would make, ever since he ran wild on "American Idol" three years ago.

It wasn't just Glambert's dynamite-with-a-laser-beam voice that got him into our national knickers: It was his warmth, his humor, his burlesque bravado.

His 2010 debut, "For Your Entertainment," was a typical "Idol" quickie -- decent, but it needed more personality.

"Trespassing" delivers, with a mix of tinsel disco-club sleaze and leather-boy love ballads. While he excels in a radio cheddar bomb like "Naked Love," he gets deeper in slow jams like "Underneath" and "Outlaws of Love." But all over "Trespassing," Glambert sings everything like Zeus in a thong.
