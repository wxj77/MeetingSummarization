(CNN) -- State authorities dispatched emergency crews Tuesday to survey the damage after an onslaught of severe weather in Mississippi that injured at least 17 people, damaged property and cut power.

The National Weather Service said "probable tornados" caused significant damage across central Mississippi, including in Yazoo, Attala, Warren, Oktibbeha, and Smith counties.

In Attala County, storms damaged several mobile homes, injuring six people and leaving parts of the area without power, the service said.

Eleven more people were injured in Monroe County, where storms damaged homes and a radio communications tower, it said.

A tornado touched down in Yazoo County on Monday night, causing damage to a downtown Yazoo City courthouse and tossing debris in a wide area, according to emergency management spokesman.

The twister touched down around 8:05 p.m. local time (9:05 p.m. ET), according to the National Weather Service's Jackson, Mississippi, office.

Approximately 30 percent of the area is still without power, the Weather Service reported.

Greg Flynn, spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, said the damage included "a lot of windows blown out, some roof damage and very little power in the downtown area" of Yazoo City.

No severe injuries or deaths have been reported, he said.

"We've been getting inundated with round after round after round" of heavy rain, Flynn said Tuesday morning.

In April, at least 10 people died when a mile-wide tornado tore through Mississippi. Two of the dead were children, and one was a 3-month-old baby, according to the state emergency management agency. Five of the dead were from Choctaw County, in the north central part of the state, four were from Yazoo County, north of Jackson, and one was from Holmes County, also in north central Mississippi.

CNN Radio's Greg Black and CNN's Sean Morris and Holly Yan contributed to this report.
