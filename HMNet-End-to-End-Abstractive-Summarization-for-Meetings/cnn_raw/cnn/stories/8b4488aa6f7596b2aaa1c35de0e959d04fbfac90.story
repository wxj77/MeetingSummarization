(CNN) -- It's a fishing trip that could have had a very different ending.

Efstathios "Steve" Moumouris' wife had fitting words shortly after the Florida man was rescued from the Gulf of Mexico, where he had bobbed for nearly 24 hours.

"There are no words to describe it," Anastasia Moumouris told CNN Tampa affiliate WTSP. "I said if anybody could make it would be him."

The dehydrated Moumouris, 51, was spotted by good Samaritans who were out fishing for scallops off of Crystal River in Citrus County. He was about seven miles southwest of Crystal River.

"We got him on board and he was fairly coherent," said Todd Hoy.

The man had texted his wife Wednesday afternoon to tell her he was heading in, according to WTSP. He was not heard from again and she contacted authorities.

Moumouris' 16-food boat earlier Thursday was found unattended nine miles from the Fort Island boat ramp.

The Citrus County Sheriff's Office said a storm tossed Moumouris from his vessel. He was not wearing a life jacket when found.

The fisherman was expected to be released from a local hospital.
