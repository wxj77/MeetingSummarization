LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have announced they are reducing their fuel surcharges as the price of oil has plummeted.

Passengers on long-haul flights will enjoy the biggest reduction in fares.

Both airlines said the cuts, effective Thursday, reflected the lower price of oil, and BA also credited its fuel hedging policy.

It means BA passengers will pay £30-35 ($46-54) less on flights longer than nine hours, and £15-20 ($23-31) less on shorter flights, the airline said.

European services will cost £4-5 ($6-7) less, BA said.

Virgin Atlantic passengers will see similar reductions in the ticket price, the airline said.

The fuel surcharge helped airlines pass the high cost of oil on to their passengers. As prices have dropped from a record high in the summer, airlines have been under pressure to cut the fee.

This the second fuel surcharge reduction for BA. It first cut the charge in October.
