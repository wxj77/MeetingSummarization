(CNN) -- Tim McGraw "instinctively swatted" at a fan who refused to let go of his leg during the finale of an Atlanta concert last week, a rep said.

"At the end of the night during the encore, Tim was singing out in the audience and someone firmly grabbed onto his leg and wouldn't let go as he was moving through the crowd," the rep said in a statement. "He instinctively swatted to try and keep them from ripping his jeans (which they succeeded at doing!) and so he could get to more fans who were trying to slap hands with him before the end of the show.

"He didn't know who had grabbed him and was simply trying to keep his pants from being torn."

The fan's clutching -- and McGraw's response -- are seen on a video posted on TMZ.com. In the shaky, somewhat grainy footage, McGraw makes his way down a catwalk above the audience as he sings "Truck Yeah." An energetic woman reaches out and grabs the side of his leg, and McGraw reacts.

The site later posted a clearer video that appears to show the woman ripping McGraw's jeans.

The woman was escorted away.

The summer leg of McGraw's "Sundown Heaven Town" tour continues through the end of August.
