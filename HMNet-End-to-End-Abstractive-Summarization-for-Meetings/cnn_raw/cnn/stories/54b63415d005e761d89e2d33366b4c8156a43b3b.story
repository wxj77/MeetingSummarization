(CNN) -- As many as four African migrants from Ethiopia and Eritrea trying to cross into Israel from Egypt's Sinai desert were shot dead by smugglers and 10 others were wounded, according to state media.

The smugglers opened fire when the group refused to pay them, according to Egypt's official MENA news agency.

Egypt's interior ministry confirmed that an investigation was under way into the incident, though its casualty figures differed. An official at the ministry told CNN that two Eritreans were killed on Egypt's border with Israel, and that three people were wounded. Fifteen others were arrested by Egyptian border police.

In total, the group consisted of three-dozen African migrants attempting to flee into Israel, the official said.
