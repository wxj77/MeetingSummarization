(CNN) -- Eminem and Rihanna's "Monster" is headed for the MTV Movie Awards.

The duo will perform the No. 1 hit live for the first time at 2014's show, which is scheduled to air on Sunday, April 13. They'll join previously announced performers Ellie Goulding, Zedd and twenty one pilots.

Through user votes, the MTV Movie Awards honors the best, funniest and most absurd in movies from the prior year with the network's version of a trophy: the golden popcorn statue. This year's ceremony will be led by late night host and comedian Conan O'Brien.

It'll also be a big night for Channing Tatum, who will receive MTV's Trailblazer Award. Tatum, 33, is the first male star to receive the honor, which is in its third year and recognizes actors who've taken "unique and diverse" paths to success.

Prior recipients include Emma Watson and Emma Stone, the latter of whom will make an appearance by video during the ceremony. Stone and her "Amazing Spider-Man" co-star Andrew Garfield are scheduled to reveal a never-before-seen clip from their May release, "The Amazing Spider-Man 2."

The MTV Movie Awards will kick off Sunday at 9 p.m. ET/8 p.m. CT, and fans can still cast their vote for who should win.

Following their performance at the MTV Movie Awards, Eminem and Rihanna will gear up for a brief joint tour this August, when they'll co-headline tour stops in Los Angeles, New York and Detroit.
