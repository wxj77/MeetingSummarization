If Bill Murray doesn't want to star in another "Ghostbusters" movie, maybe he could be the casting director.

While at the Toronto International Film Festival this week, Murray spoke about the rumored all-female "Ghostbusters" movie that studio Sony is said to be considering. (In August, reports indicated the company was toying with the idea of a reboot, and was taking a look at "Bridesmaids" director Paul Feig as a potential helmer.)

Although Murray has shied away from participating in more "Ghostbusters" films, that doesn't mean he's against an all-female installment.

"I'm fine with it; I'd go to that movie," Murray told The Toronto Star at TIFF, where his drama/comedy with Melissa McCarthy, "St. Vincent," had a premiere. "They'd probably have better outfits, too."

Who could be the movie's stars? Murray has some ideas.

"Melissa (McCarthy) would be a spectacular Ghostbuster," Murray said, mentioning his latest co-star right off the bat. "And Kristen Wiig is so funny. God, she's funny!"

His wish list doesn't end there: "I like this ('Mad Men's') Linda Cardellini a lot. And Emma Stone is funny. There are some funny girls out there."

From Murray's lips to Sony's ears.
