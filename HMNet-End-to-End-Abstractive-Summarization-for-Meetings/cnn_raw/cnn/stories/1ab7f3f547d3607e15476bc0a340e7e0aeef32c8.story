(CNN) -- Chelsea have closed the gap on leaders Manchester United at the top of the English Premier League after a John Terry header and a Frank Lampard double gave them a comfortable 3-1 win at Blackpool on Monday.

Terry was left unmarked to nod home Lampard's 20th minute corner to put the defending champions on their way to a second victory in a week -- following last Tuesday's 2-1 home success over United.

Blackpool were unlucky not to level before half-time when midfielder Jason Puncheon's fierce low drive was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Petr Cech.

But Lampard doubled the advantage just past the hour mark when he converted from the penalty spot after substitute Salomon Kalou was tripped in the area by defender Ian Evatt.

And the England midfielder was on hand again four minutes later when he slid the ball home after Kalou's pass had split Blackpool's defence wide open.

But Blackpool continued to battle away and they scored a late consolation goal when Puncheon found the corner of the net after being set-up by James Beattie.

The result means Chelsea stay in fourth place, nine points behind United although they do have a game in hand.

However, Blackpool remain in relegation trouble and they lie in 15th place, just two points and three positions above the relegation zone.

Meanwhile, in Spain's Primera Liga, Deportivo La Coruna beat Real Sociedad 2-1 to improve their chance of avoiding relegation.

Deportivo's victory means they are up to 13th position, five points clear of the bottom three, while Sociedad are ninth and look clear of relegation danger.
