(CNN)The trailer for "Mission: Impossible 5" is out, offering the first glimpse of the latest installment in the action-packed franchise.

Tom Cruise is back in the role of spy Ethan Hunt in "Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation," which hits theaters July 13.

Cruise shared news of the trailer's release Sunday on Twitter.

The film was originally scheduled for release next winter. Paramount moved up the release date to July 31 to get a head start on this year's anticipated action flicks, including the next Bond movie, Variety said in January.

The trailer promises the outlandish stunt work we've come to expect from the franchise: Cruise hanging off the side of a moving vehicle, a motorcycle chase and Cruise jumping off a building

Co-stars Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames return, and Alec Baldwin joins the cast.
