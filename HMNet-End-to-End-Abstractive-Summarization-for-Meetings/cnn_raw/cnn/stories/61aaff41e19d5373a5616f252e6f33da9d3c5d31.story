(EW.com) -- Universal announced at its CinemaCon presentation today that it plans to produce a "Pitch Perfect" sequel that would hit theaters sometime in 2015.

The reveal doesn't come as too much of a surprise to anyone who's been paying attention.

"Pitch Perfect" earned $112 million worldwide against a slight $17 million budget, and in the months since its theatrical run has kept hitting new high notes. According to Universal, the film has earned over $90 million across all home market platforms, and it currently stands as the studio's third highest-grossing VOD title ever behind blockbusters "Ted" and "Bridesmaids."

On top of that, the "Pitch Perfect" soundtrack has sold over 636,000 copies and spawned a hit single â€” complete with its own music video -- with Anna Kendrick's "Cups."

Kay Cannon, who penned "Pitch Perfect," will write the screenplay for the sequel, but no other cast or crew have been revealed as of yet. Still, given the cast's recent MTV Movie Awards reunion (which, notably, excluded star Anna Kendrick), it's safe to assume that most of the major players will be back for a second round of choral comedy.
