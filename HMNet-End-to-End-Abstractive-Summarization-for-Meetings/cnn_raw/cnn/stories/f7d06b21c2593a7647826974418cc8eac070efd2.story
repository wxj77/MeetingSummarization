(CNN) -- Ferrari's plans to unveil their new car for the 2012 Formula One season have been scuppered by heavy snowfall at the Italian team's Maranello factory.

The legendary marque had planned to showcase the new car, which they hope will win them a first drivers' championship since 2007, on Friday.

"There was no let up from the snow last night, which continued to fall on Maranello and the surrounding area and the situation does not appear to be changing this morning," the team told the sport's official website.

New car gives McLaren confidence to end Red Bull dominance

"The forecast is still bad both in terms of predictions of more snowfall and of a further drop in temperature. Therefore, the decision has been taken to cancel the presentation ceremony for the new car."

Despite the setback, Ferrari -- who have won a record 16 constructors' championships -- still plan to publish pictures and technical analysis on their website on Friday.

British outfit McLaren unveiled their 2012 model Wednesday, while reigning drivers' and constructors' champions Red Bull will have an online launch on Monday.

Red Bull's German driver Sebastian Vettel has won the drivers' title for the last two years and is the sport's youngest double world champion.

The 2012 F1 season will get underway with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 18.
