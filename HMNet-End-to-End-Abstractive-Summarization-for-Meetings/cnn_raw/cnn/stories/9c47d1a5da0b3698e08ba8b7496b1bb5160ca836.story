Knight was 28.

In a statement, the Kenosha, Wisconsin, police said it received a medical call on Thanksgiving morning about a 28-year-old male found unconscious and not breathing at a local house.

Attempts by friends and Kenosha emergency personnel to revive him were unsuccessful, police said.

Knight had been out with friends Wednesday night into Thursday morning. The cause of death is pending while toxicology tests are run, but police said it did not see any obvious signs of injuries.
