(CNN Student News) -- September 12, 2013

On Thursday's edition of CNN Student News, we recap President Obama's speech regarding Syria, and we share one U.S. senator's response. We also report on violence in Libya, and we show how Americans remembered the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. And in an industry focused on looks, one model hopes to make a difference by standing out.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript, the Daily Curriculum, Maps pertaining to today's show, and a place for you to leave feedback.
