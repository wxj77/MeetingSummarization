Don't think I've ever seen this before: Syfy's social media sensation "Sharknado" just delivered its biggest audience yet.

Not for its premiere airing. Not for its second airing. But for its third airing -- weeks after the film's original telecast.

The campy horror film delivered a record 2.1 million total viewers and 791,000 adults 18-49 on Saturday night. That's the most-watched encore for an original movie in Syfy history.

What's particularly impressive about the performance is that the film's debut telecast -- despite generating massive buzz on Twitter, clocking a whirlwind 5,000 tweets per minute during its peak -- initially delivered a somewhat disappointing 1.4 million viewers a few weeks ago.

But the social buzz continued after the film's premiere. Then the second airing climbed to 1.9 million viewers. And now it's crossed the 2 million mark.

There is, of course, a sequel in the works for next year, while the original "Sharknado" is getting the unusual honor of a limited theatrical release.

"Sharknado" will have its final Syfy airing this summer on Thursday, August 22, leading into the premiere of "Ghost Shark."
