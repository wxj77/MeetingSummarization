(EW.com) -- Heavy may be the head that wears the crown, but hot is the head that's third in line.

Prince Harry, 28, has been named the Top Bachelor, according to the editors at Town & Country, which named the current top 50 bachelors in the world.

"Prince William's baby brother flirts and flies Apache helicopters with equal aplomb," the magazine wrote.

The list isn't very Hollywood specific (although both George Clooney and Jack Nicholson made the cut). Instead, in addition to the prince, people like Ralph Lauren's son, Andrew, President Obama's speechwriter Jon Favreau, and Greek shipping heir Stavros Niarchos (who has dated both Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton) snagged a spot.

Most hilariously, still-just-a-high-schooler Conor Kennedy made the cut. The magazine said it best: "A mere child to some, this Deerfield Academy junior and son of Robert Kennedy Jr. was a gateway to the compound for Taylor Swift. Now he's lyric fodder." Insert your own 'never, ever wanting to get back together' joke here.

'NCIS' high, 'New Girl' low: Ratings

It's hard to make an argument against Harry's No. 1 ranking (although seeing all the attention the Duchess of Cambridge receives on a daily basis could make some women want to run for the hills). More so than normal, Harry has been in the public eye this year, whether he was losing his clothes in Las Vegas or cheering on Olympians at the London Games.

"Harry might not possess a towering intellect," the magazine explained. "But he is cooler and more appealing than his older brother, sweet as William undoubtedly is."

You guys! Town & Country just called William a nerd! Does anyone even remember when William was considered the dreamboat of the two?

His big bro may be taken, but word of advice to any woman trying to snag the fun-loving, polo-playing prince so that they can go on double dates with Will and Kate: You'll have to contend with all-too-real Harry Hunters (not a Potter reference) in your quest for the Most Eligible Bachelor â€” and those ladies mean business.
