Gov. Chris Christie has long made it clear that he holds sharp disdain for Washington. In fact, he finds it so unappealing, he'd rather drown himself than serve in Congress.

Speaking at the New Jersey NAACP conference on Saturday, the second term Republican governor emphasized that he never plans on running for office in New Jersey again.

Most think Congress is worst in their lifetime

"The only job left for me to run for is United States Senate, and let me just say this: I would rather die than be in the United States Senate. Okay? I would be bored to death," Christie, who's considering a 2016 presidential bid, said to laughs from the audience.

"Can you imagine me bangin' around that chamber with 99 other people? Asking for a motion on the amendment in the subcommittee? Forget it. It would be over, everybody. You'd watch me just walk out and walk right into the Potomac River and drown. That'd be it."
