(CNN) -- Last year he shocked South Africa's Oscar Pistorius to win over 200m at the Paralympics and Sunday Brazil's Alan Oliveira returned to London's Olympic Stadium to prove he is the fastest amputee sprinter in the world.

The 20-year-old Oliveira stormed to victory over 100m in 10.57 seconds, shattering his own recently set record for his T43 class.

It left him well clear of American Richard Browne, who finished second in a mixed class race, in 10.75 seconds, itself a world record for a single amputee in the T44 class.

Britain's Jonnie Peacock, who won 100m gold in his class before his home crowd last year, finished third in a career-best 10.84 seconds.

"I can't express how happy I am," Oliveira said. "Richard Browne and Jonnie are very fast, I know that. I just wanted to run for 10 seconds and that's what I did."

His performance highlighted the final day of three days of competition in the London Anniversary Games, with the last given over to Paralympic classes.

The crowds had come in their droves to pack the stadium the first two days, with Usain Bolt and home hero Mo Farah very much the stars of the show and it was no different Sunday.

Oliveira's 200m win in 2012 left Pistorius stunned, with accusations flying over the length of the Brazilian's special running blades.

Pistorius, who is facing a murder trial in his native South Africa, later apologized and Oliveira's subsequent performances have backed up his breakthrough victory.

His final surge in the 100m would have done Bolt proud as he chopped over two tenths of a second off the world best.

Fellow Brazilian, blind runner Terezinha Guilhermina, cruised to 200m victory in her class in 24.91 seconds.

Guilhermina and Oliveira are set to be the faces of the Paralympic competition in Rio in 2016.

Britain's David Weir was a similar standard bearer going into London 2012 and did not disappoint his followers in the anniversary meet, winning a wheelchair mile in three minutes 16.40 seconds.
