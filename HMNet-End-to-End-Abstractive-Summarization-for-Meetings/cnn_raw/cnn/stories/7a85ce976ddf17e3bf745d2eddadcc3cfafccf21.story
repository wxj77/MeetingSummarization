Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has been killed. Here are the latest developments:

-- Reacting to the news of Gadhafi's death, Vice President Joe Biden said that "NATO got it right" and "the people of Libya got rid of a dictator."

-- The South African government said "a lasting and sustainable peaceful solution is possible through an all-inclusive political process."

-- Even with Gadhafi dead, analysts say it will likely take years for the country's oil to return to full production. It's thought that Libya is already producing about 350,000 barrels of oil per day, up from near zero during the depths of the conflict.

-- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Gadhafi's death "clears the way for the Transitional National Council in Libya to begin to put together a representative government."

-- German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the death of Gadhafi is "important" for Libyans.

-- French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office called Gadhafi's "disappearance" Thursday a "major step" in the struggle by Libyans to "free themselves from dictatorship and violence."

Earlier developments:

On the ground:

-- Gadhafi's son Mutassim has been killed, according to Anees al-Sharif, spokesman for AbdelHakim Belhajj of the Tripoli military council.

-- Al-Sharif also said Gadhafi's chief of intelligence, Abdullah al-Senussi, has been killed.

-- Libyans erupted in jubilation with the first reports that Gadhafi may have been killed. A "cacophony of celebration" could be heard in Tripoli as ships and cars blasted their horns and shots were fired into the air.

-- Revolutionary fighters attacked the house where Gadhafi was hiding, National Transitional Council Information Minister Mahmoud Shammam told CNN. Gadhafi was shot while trying to flee, he said.

-- A cell phone photograph distributed by the news agency Agence France-Presse appeared to show the arrest of a bloodied Gadhafi. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the image.

-- A video surfaced that apparently shows Gadhafi's body.

International:

-- NATO is going to convene soon for a meeting to discuss ending its operation in Libya, a source told CNN's Barbara Starr on Thursday.

-- NATO said its aircraft struck two pro-Gadhafi military vehicles in the vicinity of Sirte on Thursday. "These armed vehicles were conducting military operations and presented a clear threat to civilians," Col. Roland Lavoie said.

-- U.S. Defense Department costs for operations in Libya stand at about $1.1 billion as of September 30, according to Pentagon spokesman George Little. That includes daily military operations, munitions, the drawdown of supplies and humanitarian assistance.

-- Opposition activists from Syria and Yemen said dictators should pay heed to the fate of Gadhafi.

-- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, "This day marks an historic transition for Libya"

-- Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Gadhafi's death marks the end of his reign of terror and the promise of a new Libya.
