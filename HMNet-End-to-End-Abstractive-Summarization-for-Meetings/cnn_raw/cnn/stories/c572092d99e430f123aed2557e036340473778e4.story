(CNN) -- Wednesday, January 20

10:13 p.m. -- Thousands of people went to a wharf in devastated Port-auPrince today, hoping to board a ferry -- paid for by the Haitian government -- bound for another part of Haiti. The ferry's owner told CNN the craft is licensed to carry 600 people, but on the last trip, more than were 3,000 onboard, CNN's Ivan Watson and Rich Phillips reported.

7:52 p.m. -- The head of the International Monetary Fund has called for for a modern-day Marshall Plan to rebuild Haiti. "My belief is that Haiti ... needs something which is big, not only a piecemeal approach, but something which will be much bigger to deal with the reconstruction of the country, some kind of a Marshall Plan," Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on CNN's "Amanpour." Strauss-Kahn did not offer specifics of what he envisions for a Haiti rebuilding effort, nor did he outline a timeframe.

7:36 p.m. -- President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama have given $15,000 to the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, which was set up to help Haiti after last week's earthquake.

7:31 p.m. -- Trained dogs have indicated at least one person may be alive under the rubble of an auto parts store in Port-au-Prince. A Los Angeles, California-based search and rescue team is checking the rubble for survivors.

Americans are believed to be among the trapped.

6:49 p.m. -- People trapped because of the January 12 earthquake still could be alive if they were well hydrated when the quake happened, said Dr. Michael Gerardi, a pediatric emergency specialist in Morristown, New Jersey. "It's conceivable, and not unheard of, for people to live seven to 10 days with no water or food -- if they have not been exposed to the elements," he told CNN's Tom Watson. Gerardi's comments come on a day when a 5-year-old boy was rescued from rubble in Haiti, eight days after the earthquake.

5:15 p.m. -- Retired U.S. Lt. Gen. Russel Honor√©, who led relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina in 2005, has expanded on comments he made to CNN yesterday about his belief that the most vulnerable in the earthquake zone should be evacuated. "I don't know if the flow of supplies can keep up with demand, unless we evacuate the injured, elderly, pregnant women, babies, and the disabled," he said Wednesday. "It is wishful thinking to add more hospitals. We need to think how these airplanes can leave with patients to the U.S. and other countries to be distributed to hospitals to stabilize them."  Read

4:55 p.m. -- A 5-year-old boy named Monley was pulled alive from a collapsed Haitian home on Wednesday, eight days after the earthquake. His mother was killed and his father is missing. It was unclear whether the boy had access to food and water, but doctors attributed his survival to resilience and the strength of his young body. He was taken to a hospital -- doctors said he had no broken bones but was suffering from severe dehydration. Read | Watch

4:48 p.m. -- The Canadian military also is opening other aid routes (see U.S. military efforts in previous entry). Canadian troops are working to open an airfield in the southern city of Jacmel by Thursday, Canadian Defense Minster Peter Mackay said. Two warships also are landing supplies by sea, and Canada has reached an agreement with Jamaica to fly supplies into southern Haiti from there. The moves come amid complaints from relief agency Doctors Without Borders that air traffic congestion in Port-au-Prince was delaying aid and costing lives.

4:45 p.m. -- The U.S. military, trying to open other aid routes into Haiti, says it has obtained landing rights at the Dominican Republic's air base at San Isidro, about 150 miles east of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince.
