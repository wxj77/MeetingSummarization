(CNN) -- An Illinois man was arrested in connection with the discovery of two hidden cameras found in a gym's tanning salon.

The cameras were found in two separate tanning rooms at Planet Fitness in Moline and reported to police on November 5th and 6th, Sgt. Sgt Kevin Cox told CNN.

A police investigation led to the Friday arrest of 27-year-old Trent Hamer on charges of unauthorized videotaping. Hamer was released on $2,500 bond the following day, Cox said.

Hamer was a member of the gym, not an employee, Planet Fitness spokeswoman McCall Gosselin said in an email.

"His membership has been terminated," she said.

"At Planet Fitness, the safety and privacy of our members is extremely important to us. As such, the franchise owner is working very closely with the local authorities on this matter, and we appreciate their swift action in this case."
