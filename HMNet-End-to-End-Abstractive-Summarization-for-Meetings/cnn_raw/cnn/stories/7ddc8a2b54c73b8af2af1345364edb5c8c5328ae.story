(EW.com) -- Kaley Cuoco is set to return as host of the 2013 People's Choice Awards, CBS announced today.

Cuoco, who stars as Penny on CBS' hit comedy "The Big Bang Theory," first hosted the awards show in January, replacing five-year veteran Queen Latifah. Her lively, self-deprecating performance -- along with cameos from Neil Patrick Harris, the cast of "Parks & Recreation," and others -- garnered significant praise.

"She is such an engaging performer who brings an undeniable energy and passion to our stage," People's Choice Awards executive producer Mark Burnett said in a statement. "There is no doubt she will be a key part of what makes this year's show a can't miss event."

The People's Choice Awards have aired annually since 1975, with winners selected entirely by viewers and fans. The show is designed to celebrate highlights in pop culture -- last year's nominees included, in various categories, Katy Perry, Glee, and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2."

The 39th annual People's Choice Awards will broadcast live from the Nokia Theatre on January 9, 2013.
