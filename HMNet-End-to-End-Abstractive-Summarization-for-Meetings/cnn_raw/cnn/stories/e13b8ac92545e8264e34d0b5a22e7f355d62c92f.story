(CNN) -- Residents near a fast-growing wildfire in Southern California were evacuated Wednesday as hundreds of firefighters tried to contain the blaze that had grown to 1,700 acres.

One firefighter suffered minor injuries, the Riverside County Fire Department said.

There were no exact numbers on how many people had been evacuated from what's being called the Summit Fire as of Wednesday evening, but authorities said a 200-unit mobile home park in Cherry Valley had been cleared.

They also said some residents in Banning were told to leave their homes. Banning is about 25 miles west of Palm Springs.

An evacuation center has been opened at the Banning Community Services Center, officials said.

The fire department said on its website that 425 firefighters were involved in efforts to douse the flames.

The state agency Cal Fire reported 30% containment of the blaze just before 7 p.m. (10 p.m. ET) Wednesday.

CNN affiliate KTLA said at least one home was burned as 30-mph winds drove the flames.

The National Weather Service in San Diego said a red flag warning was in effect until Friday evening. Forecasters called for wind speeds between 15 and 25 mph with gusts up to 55 mph.

CNN's Cheri Mossburg, Erica Henry and Irving Last contributed to this report.
