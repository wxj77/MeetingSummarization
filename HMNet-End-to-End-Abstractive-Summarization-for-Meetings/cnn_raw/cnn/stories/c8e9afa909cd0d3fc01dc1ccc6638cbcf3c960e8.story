(CNN) -- Apple is developing iPhones with curved-glass screens and enhanced sensors that detect different levels of pressure, according to a new report.

Two models â€” with screens of 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches â€”are in the works, and both would use glass that curves downward at the edges, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source familiar with the plans. These screen sizes almost rival that of Samsung's Galaxy Note 3, which boasts a 5.7-inch screen.

For its part, Apple's iPhone 5S has a 4-inch screen.

The new phones would likely be released in the third quarter of next year, the source said, adding that Apple is also testing "pressure-sensitive technology," which won't be ready for the next iPhone launch.

Curved glass has become a smartphone trend among major tech companies. Samsung last month released its Galaxy Round phone, which has a 5.7-inch curved display, while LG is set to release its G Flex phone, which is curved from top to bottom.

Apple has not confirmed any rumors, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
