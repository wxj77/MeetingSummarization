Maumelle, Arkansas (CNN) -- A man whose naked body was found next to a sleeping TV weatherman in an unfilled tub earlier this month died from asphyxiation, authorities said Thursday, but there was "no indication" he was strangled.

Maumelle, Arkansas, police Lt. Jim Hansard noted that the medical examiner cited other contributing factors in 24-year-old Dexter Williams' death, including intoxication with methamphetamine and amphetamines.

Police said the investigation remains open and there is "no indication (from the medical examiner) in any way that there was a strangulation,' and the manner of death remains 'undetermined."

Police say Williams' body was discovered September 5 in a hot tub with former TV meteorologist Brett Cummins.

Cummins, 33, has not been charged in the case. He has since resigned from KARK-TV in Little Rock.

The owner of the home, Christopher Barbour, found Williams' body at the bottom of an empty tub, his face blue and purple and a chain resembling a dog collar around his neck, according to a Maumelle police report.

Maumelle police will soon turn the case over to the Pulaski County Prosecutor's Office, which will determine whether any charges will be filed.
