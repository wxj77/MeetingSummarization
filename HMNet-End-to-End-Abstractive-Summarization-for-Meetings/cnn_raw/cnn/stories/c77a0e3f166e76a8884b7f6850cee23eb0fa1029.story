Paul Simon and his wife Edie Brickell will not be prosecuted on domestic violence charges filed against the couple after an argument, a court official said Tuesday.

The prosecutor decided to drop the domestic violence case against the singing couple, the clerk of Norwalk, Connecticut, Superior Court told CNN.

Simon, 72, and Brickell, 47, were arrested on disorderly conduct charges by police investigating a family dispute at their New Canaan, Connecticut, home on April 26, according to police.  They were released from jail the next morning.

The couple held hands when appearing before a judge in court appearance the next day.  "Edie and I are fine," Simon told the judge. "We're going to see our son's baseball game this afternoon."

Brickell, in a statement sent to CNN by her lawyer, took the blame for starting the argument.  "I got my feelings hurt and I picked a fight with my husband," Brickell said. "The police called it disorderly.  Thank God it's orderly now."

Simon and Brickell live in New Canaan, an affluent community about an hour's train ride from Manhattan. The town is home to a long list of rich and famous.

Simon is half of the legendary duo of Simon and Garfunkel that, starting in the 1960s, had hits including "Bridge Over Troubled Water," "Mrs. Robinson," "The Sound of Silence" and "Scarborough Fair." His solo career has spanned four decades and produced hits including, "Still Crazy After All These Years," "Graceland" and "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover."

Brickell has one chart hit, titled "What I Am," with her 1980s rock group Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. She has also recorded with Simon during their 22 years of marriage.
