"As always, we follow a protocol and we have done all the investigations and all the cardiorespiratory and biomechanical studies and the truth is that he is in excellent physical condition and available for the coaching staff when they see fit.," Diez said in a statement on the Real Madrid website.

"I highlight the physical condition he is in. He arrives at the club a physical marvel and we think he will serve the club well," he added.

The Welshman has made no secret of his desire to join Madrid admitting it was a "dream come true" on Tottenham Hotspur's website on Sunday.

"I am not sure there is ever a good time to leave a club where I felt settled and was playing the best football of my career to date," Bale's statement read. "I know many players talk of their desire to join the club of their boyhood dreams, but I can honestly say, this is my dream come true."

Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy said it was never his wish to sell Bale, but the club were forced to bow to the inevitable.

"Such has been the attention from Real Madrid and so great is Gareth's desire to join them, that we have taken the view that the player will not be sufficiently committed to our campaign in the current season," Levy told Tottenham's website.

Bale has agreed a six-year contract with Madrid which will see him reportedly earn around $13.2 million a year after tax.

The reported $132 million (Â£85 millon) fee sees Madrid break their own world transfer record set when they signed Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for $124.6 million (Â£80 million) in 2009.
