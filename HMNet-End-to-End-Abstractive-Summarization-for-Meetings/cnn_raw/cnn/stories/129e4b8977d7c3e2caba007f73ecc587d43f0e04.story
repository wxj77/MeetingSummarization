Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's arrival in Tehran Saturday was marked by an incident during which a shoe was thrown by a protester in his direction, Iran's semi-official Fararu news agency said.

A group of Iranian protesters, opposed to dialog with the United States, were at Tehran's airport where Rouhani supporters had also gathered to welcome the president home, Fararu said.

Rouhani left the airport with his entourage without any further incident, and was accompanied by his supporters shouting, "Rouhani, Rouhani we support you," according to Fararu.

Rouhani, who was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, spoke by telephone Friday with U.S. President Barack Obama -- the first direct conversation between leaders in Washington and Tehran since 1979.

Rouhani's recent comments have raised hopes that a deal could be struck over the Iran's controversial nuclear program.

Western leaders believe the country's nuclear program is designed to produce weapons. Iranian leaders have said it is purely peaceful.

Shoe throwing is seen as highly offensive in the Middle East for cultural and religious reasons.
