Will Smith's date doctor "Hitch" is setting up a practice on TV.

According to numerous reports, Fox is adapting the 2005 romantic comedy into a half-hour show, in addition to trying to create TV versions of comedies "Big" and "Monster-in-Law."

Smith starred in the movie "Hitch" as the titular dating guru Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, who would help ordinary men shape up and land the partner of their dreams. Eva Mendes co-starred as the woman Hitch falls for.

The movie has had a long shelf life, as it's still in regular rotation on cable after earning close to $370 million at the box office worldwide.

For the TV version, Fox has a script commitment in place for a concept that's being pitched as a "workplace comedy that explores dating and sexual politics."

Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, are attached to executive produce the project along with James Lassiter, Caleeb Pinkett, Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont.

Kaplan and Elfont, who've scribed "Can't Hardly Wait"; "Surviving Christmas"; and "Made of Honor," are tackling the "Hitch" comedy script.

There's no mention of whether Smith would be interested in filling the role of suave Alex Hitchens once again. Who else would you want to see play the role of Hitch?
